It is in-advisable to publish scores from multi-bleu.perl.  The scores depend on your tokenizer, which is unlikely to be reproducible from your paper or consistent across research groups.  Instead you should detokenize then use mteval-v14.pl, which has a standard tokenization.  Scores from multi-bleu.perl can still be used for internal purposes when you have a consistent tokenizer.
BLEU = 31.96, 67.1/40.4/26.5/17.9 (BP=0.949, ratio=0.951, hyp_len=65518, ref_len=68928)
