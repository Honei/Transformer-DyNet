police of Karratha arrested 20 @-@ year @-@ old after fast motorcycle hunt
a motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 mph in a 70 mph zone and through bushland to escape police in Bilbara .
traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it as it left a petrol station on Bathdate Road at 125 mph .
police reports that the driver then ignored the neck signals and continued to drive on Burgess Road before bouncing into the bushland where officials lost it from the eyes .
the motorcycle as well as a person who matched the driver &apos;s description were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgarra .
Karratha police accused a 20 @-@ year @-@ old man of failing to observe a neck signal as well as reckless driving .
he is due to appear before the District Court in Karratha on September 23 .
the motorcycle was secured and seized for three months .
George Webster charged over hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry

George Webster , 28 , was handed the charge at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow .
he is accused of raping a woman at Scotland &apos;s hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7 , 2013 .
the charge is that Webster attacked her while she was &quot; unconscious , slept , and could not signal consent . &quot;
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on May 4 , 2014 .

return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
congressional Democrats Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organization of unions as a civil right .
&quot; as unions die , middle class jobs also die , &quot; said Ellison , a Democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress .
I am therefore proud , together with the civil rights activist John Lewis , to present the Staff Authorisation Act .
this groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunity to discriminate on grounds of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops such anti @-@ union forces .
the addition of the National Labour Law Act to create a way of discriminating against workers to organise a union representation to bring justice before a civil court - and to obtain compensation or penalties - is a meaningful and necessary initiative .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not according to American standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what Ellison , Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to connect back to a very American idea .
despite the setbacks that unions have faced in recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognise , expand and respect labor rights .
there was a time when millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath .
when the United States occupied Japan after World War II , General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that should ensure that militarized autocracy would replace Hedki Tojos with democracy .
fully aware that workers and their unions took a role in creating a new Japan , they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that &quot; workers &apos; rights to union and joint bargaining and action are guaranteed . &quot;
when the United States occupy Germany after World War II , General Dwight urged David Eisenhower and his staff to write a constitution that would ensure fascism would replace Adolf Hitler with strong democracy .
in recognition of the fact that workers would have to organise themselves and raise their voices in the new nation , Germans inserted a clause explicitly saying : &quot; the right to set up associations to safeguard and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and every profession or business .
agreements that restrict this right or aim to diminish it are null and void ; these measures are illegal .
when former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission , which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement , Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that &quot; everyone has the right to form unions to protect their interests . &quot;
for generations , Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
when this country discussed how to form civil and democratic societies , Americans said that the right to create a union - and that this union should then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government offices - should be protected .
after these rights came under fire in America , it is indeed very wise to revisit the American ideal , which means that the working population must have the right to unite and to make their voice heard in a free and open society .
as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago :
the story is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the labor movement did not restrict the nation &apos;s strength , but enlarged it .
by raising the standard of living of millions of people , work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production .
those who attack the work forget these simple truths , but history keeps them .
history remembers , and we should do so .
formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representation - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past , triggering the promise of democracy .
judge halts temporary law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to shut down
a US federal judge on Sunday provisionally halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana , from which lawyers say it probably led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state .
this measure , which was elevated to law by Bobby Jindal , governor of Louisiana , in June and is due to enter into force on Sept . 1 , would force doctors who conduct abortions to acquire a patient &apos;s right to take part in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles around their practice .
however , the judge &apos;s decision means that doctors may , for the time being , continue to have legal abortions while requesting such a right .
&quot; the plaintiffs can continue to work law while seeking to obtain these rights , &quot; federal judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling .
a hearing will be held within one month for the judge to reach a more permanent decision on the law .
abortion advocates welcomed the decision , the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures and said doctors were daring so more time to gain hospital registration rights .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in Louisiana are escaping a back @-@ to @-@ back law that wants to take them their health and rights , &quot; said Nancy Northup , president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights , which had sued on behalf of three of the state &apos;s five clinics to halt the law .
it was not immediately clear whether the ruling also extended to doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit and also requested referral rights .
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws , with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional .
key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to shut down were stopped by a federal judge on Friday .
abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists , as well as the American Medical Association , agree that enrollment rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors .
abortion opponents maintain that the measures serve to protect women &apos;s health , although some also welcomed the impact of closing clinics .
only one doctor conducting abortions in Louisiana has patient consent rights , the Center for Reproductive Rights said .
if all the other doctors in the state are forced to no longer perform abortions , that doctor , fearing for his safety , would no longer perform the operation , the group said .
in their argument against the ruling , representatives of the state of Louisiana said they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions , while their applications for patient consent would still be pending .
delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatments lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas .
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video footage for their mother online , who died of ovarian cancer in 2007 .
for women in rural Australia , there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities .
researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians who found ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent five years after diagnosis were still alive .
research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state , mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas .
small STUDIE : new medicines could slow lung and ovarian cancer
researchers looked at women &apos;s medical care over seven years .
Dr Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis , the type of ovarian cancer , existing pre @-@ disease and social and economic status also influenced survival opportunities .
for older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at the diagnosis stage , the survival rate was lowest .
for those living in rural and remote regions of the state , mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas .
although the study did not investigate why outside the city , living women with greater likelihood of ovarian cancer died , Dr Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists , and these are mostly found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
despite improving telemedicine services to counter the distances , it proposed , as a possible remedy , a strengthening of the service of flown doctors to allow specialists to supply women more densely to their place of residence , as well as treatment programs for people outside their region .
Dr Jordan said that , regardless of geographical status , the study showed a poor long @-@ term survival rate among women in ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and screening strategies .
the study , funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer , is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
in March 2013 , Elisha Neave , a young mother of 33 years from the Gold Coast , learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .
garden centers regret falling homeowners &apos; pay
the decline , along with an increased sinking of the number of homeowners under 35 , could result in garden centers losing tens of thousands of pounds a year when today &apos;s young consumers reach the &quot; core age group for garden products , &quot; according to a study by HTA , as reported in the Financial Times .
the report says tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount spent by people with home for their garden .
the rise in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens , the popular procedure to asphale pre @-@ kindergarten for parking purposes , and the falling garden size are other factors threatening the industry , in which an estimated £ 5 billion per year is implemented on sale .
in London , where over a 6 @-@ year period the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent , the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported .
the HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens does not mean people can &apos;t pull plants .
guy Barter , chief gardener for the RHS said : &quot; container gardeners , for example , are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants in a move . &quot;
the HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &quot; golden age &quot; of gardening retailers because of rising homeownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid @-@ 1990s .
he also forecast an improved market situation this year because of better weather following unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year .
the protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri continues .
in the capital , Islamabad , about 1,000 protesters have stabbed state television station PTV .
information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters back from PTV buildings .
the station set up its operations for about 40 minutes but is now sending back .
at the same time , some 3000 protesters tried to enter Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif &apos;s residence .
about a kilometre away , they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped clashes with security forces .
police deployed tear gas .
the protesters demanded Sharif &apos;s resignation , but he rejects that .
meanwhile , the country &apos;s army cautioned for a political solution to the conflict &quot; without wasting time and using without force . &quot;
after a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday night , the military said : &quot; the army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state . &quot;
the military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already putted more often .
opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Premier Sharif of cheating in the parliamentary election in May last year .
the protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called their supporters to penetrate Sharif &apos;s residence .
three people had been killed .
Turkey orders U.S. diplomat for spy report
the Turkish Foreign Ministry has ordered the country &apos;s longest @-@ serving U.S. diplomat to release a report on American and British espionage in Turkey .
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the US Embassy &apos;s business and Turkish officials discussed the report Monday .
German magazine Der Spiegel , as well as online magazine The Intercept , reported that by the former US analyst of the National Security Agency , Edward Snowden , Turkey was a main activity area for the US and UK intelligence services .
according to Turkish news agencies , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said all major countries spied on each other .
an earlier report that Germany &apos;s main intelligence service was also targeted by Ankara caused much more angry reactions from the Turkish government .
warning : local leaders face consequences for commuters
the local guide &apos;s nationwide warning strike on Monday night could also affect passenger traffic in NRW .
the exhibition , which was announced for 18 to 21 p.m. , serves all transport companies nationwide , including public transport ,
the main purpose of the warning strike is freight transport .

said the district president of the German LokomotivGuide ( GDL ) union , Sven Schmid , in Düsseldorf .
we expect significant shortfalls .
there are no regional priorities .
the main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport .
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced it would do everything possible to minimise the impact .
however , the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike , so it was hard to predict the consequences specifically .
police chief accused of Magaluf of corruption
the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià on Friday to the office of the local prosecutor &apos;s office .
the head of Calvià police on the resort island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the infamous Binge @-@ Drinking @-@ Hotspot Magaluf .
chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was detained after allegations of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena , the street where most bars and nightclubs are at Magaluf .
according to the online daily Mallorca Diario , the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià on Friday to the office of the prosecutor for corruption of Mallorcas .
two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are interviewed jointly with Navarro by a judge .
national Spanish daily ABC reported that angry night @-@ time owners testified that authorities &apos; nepotism had a serious impact on their business .
&quot; it &apos;s no longer about money earning , it &apos;s about survival , &quot; one of the businessmen told the court .
let our livelihoods come from the game .
we have nothing to lose .
Magaluf made international headlines this summer because of a viral YouTube video showing an 18 @-@ year @-@ old British tourist performing to 24 men during a show tour Fellatio .
since then , island authorities have tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the notorious alcohol @-@ fuelled pub tours .
the Playhouse Club , in which the Fellatio incident took place , was forced to close for a year , while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage must jointly pay a fine of £ 55,000 ( $ 73,000 ) .
the tourist resort of Magaluf , which is particularly popular with young British holidaymakers , is also known for several accidents under the influence of alcohol , including the trend of &quot; balconing , &quot; where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool .
the first spring day with wet and stormy weather affects flights from Adelaide Airport
the FRÜHLING has given South Australia a wintry surprise , with fierce displays and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide Airport .
in the evening to 9 p.m. , another 5mm of rain fell to the city , after 6.6mm that had already been down on Sunday night .
the last rainfall was the result of a series of short , stormy showers , including a bus that began just before 8pm and caused nearly 4mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes .
after the winter last week caused an early dose of spring , temperatures in the city fell again to a peak of just 15.8 ° C.
bad weather conditions have likely led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide .
the plane should have landed shortly after 7.30pm but was hit by a shake @-@ up - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through .
winds reached about 50 mph on the ground at Adelaide airport at that time .
the flight data showed the plane also had to go through a second landing flight and eventually set up at about 8.40 p.m.
the flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights , including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney .
for Adelaide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday , with possible displays .
Matthies thinks : highest time for big networking
given the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high @-@ tech switching centers , our columnist Bernd Matthies consoles with an extremely familiar electronic accessory .
while I &apos;m writing this here , my look at the spiral cable that connects the listener with the phone , and I think Boah , how retro is that ?
but there is one thought behind it : if the cable was not , all listeners would fly around in the house very quickly , and that would be even more retro .
anyway , is the eceltronic ( eceltronic ?
no , tipping error : electronic ) sector the rule that today &apos;s global novelty is tomorrow &apos;s electric scrap is bought - outdated .
and anyone who still has a tube TV in the living room today , for example , only says that he rejects television in principle .
why these considerations ?
because this week we see our absolute incompetence in electronics issues .
the Laie , who used to be blind to washing machine and CD players , today does not even understand the purpose of the devices , which will be routed out in front of him with an elusive expert press : &quot; connected Home , Wearables , Health Care and Urban Technologies &quot; promises to us the Press Office .
yes , is it still ?
what should we talk to people who apparently voluntarily spread such Quark ?
in fact , for about 20 years it has been mainly a matter of confusing our house .
for the yogurt itself , so that the fire detector tells us on holiday on the Maldives that it is burning in the working room .
and wouldn &apos;t it be wonderful if we had air conditioning from the office on our early arrival ... ?
yes , this requires air conditioning .
but a dream will surely come true soon : we lift our wristwatch , tell you loud &quot; Saugen ! &quot; - and at home the vacuum cleaner drives off .
mistaken .
everything runs out to nothing less than a revolution : &quot; the boundaries between white and brown goods vanishes , &quot; raunt an industry connoisseur , you can connect the washing machine with a headphone , the steam garer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still needs , but nothing useful .
we also know from daily practice that if a new @-@ fashioned device is really needed , the battery is empty .
what &apos;s another reason the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions .
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
thousands of Israeli children from the areas near Gaza returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air shelters , while rocket and mortar fire went down on their communities during the 50 @-@ day war between Israel and Hamas and closed schools in Gaza while the area was recovering from fighting .
the school launch brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities marked by rocket launchers in southern Israel , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern city of Ashdod , staff from the Pashosh nursery , which was hit by a rocket , removed from the walls and shale walls before the students &apos; arrival .
&quot; we &apos;re a bit afraid , but are excited , &quot; said Ronit Bart , resident in the Kibbutz Saad and there English teacher .
many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine .
her 11 @-@ year @-@ old daughter Shani Bart said it feels &quot; a bit weird &quot; to suddenly go back to school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we didn &apos;t go out of the house at all , &quot; she said .
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support .
until a cease @-@ fire broke the war last week , thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza and escape the missile and mortar fire .
many residents of Nahal Oz , a community near the border with Gaza in which a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade , are still reluctant to return .
the Education Department said about a dozen families have not yet returned .
their children were provisionally housed in other schools .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot , a border town on Gaza that is hard to draw from the Palestinian shelling .
he appealed to the children to learn a lot and said &quot; we will make sure their knowledge works and provide you with security . &quot;
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite cease @-@ fire last Tuesday .
the ceasefire caused an immediate end to the fighting , but major problems remain unresolved , such as Hamas &apos;s call for the lifting of Gaza &apos;s Israeli @-@ Egyptian blockade and the reopening of air and seaports in Gaza .
Israel calls for Hamas to disarm and hand over the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month .
more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war , three @-@ quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children , according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN .
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters , but did not provide any specific evidence of this information .
on the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker , were killed .
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during fighting on Israeli cities , most in the south of the country .
meanwhile , the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
the Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools rebuilt into preliminary shelters .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and keep fighting , education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week .
&quot; I hope the school is open again soon so we can continue to learn , just like the children in the world and the Jewish children , &quot; said Mohammad Amara , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City .
by Election in Saxony : CDU @-@ Vize Strobl challenges NPD prohibition procedure
in view of the NPD &apos;s loss of votes in Saxony , CDU Federal District Attorney Thomas Strobl argued for an end to the current NPD prohibition trial before the Federal Constitutional Court .
Berlin - Laut CDU @-@ Bundesvize Thomas Strobl should end the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court .
&quot; the NPD cuts worse than last time , &quot; Strobl , who is also CDU &apos;s head of state in Baden @-@ Württemberg , told the Leipzig People &apos;s newspaper .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to conclude that the NPD is being fought politically rather than before the Constitutional Court .
the NPD was very close to the five @-@ percent hurdle in Sunday &apos;s vote .
a first push for a ban on the far @-@ right party failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection at the time also had informants in the NPD @-@ top .
in December 2013 , the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long preparation .
Federal government and Bundestag did not join .
Harburg : tents for new refugees
in Newlands Square , refugees are now housed in tents .
the headquarters initial reception for refugees in Harburg burst from all seams .
now the interior authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross .
councillors have been informed only shortly before - they are unenthusiastic .
&quot; these Hauruck actions continue to fuel citizens &apos; reservations and give district leaders no opportunity to engage constructively in the humane housing of refugees , &quot; says Britta Herrmann , Green Group Chairman at the Harburger District Assembly .
her party is demanding that the county government provide Harburg currently unused homes for accommodation .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
the reason for overcrowding in the initial recording is the rush of aid workers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide sufficient seats in subsequent facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
House prices have seen the strongest winter rise in seven years , a widely watched index shows .
the RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August , according to RP data released Monday .
as a result of this increase , the overall increase in June , July and August is 4.2 percent , the largest increase in winter months since 2007 .
the annual price rise was 10.9 percent , more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013 , but the increases were not evenly spread across the country .
RP Data &apos;s research director , Tim Lawless , said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two @-@ way market .
figures from RP Data show that house prices rose 16.1 per cent in Sydney last year , while in Melbourne , by 11.7 per cent .
the following markets are Adelaide , Brisbane and Darwin , in which prices rose on average by five and six per cent .
at the other end of the scale is Canberra , which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose only 1.4 per cent over the year .
Mr Lawless said further that with spring starting now for the next few months , an increase in properties for sale would be observed , which would subject the market to &quot; a real test . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the persistently high rate of auction prices , a generally fast sales rate and the persistently low interest rate , it is likely that home prices will rise further over the next three months , &quot; he said .
in an opinion to the New Press , he disagrees with statements by the managing director Peer Medau and attest to &quot; like a field herr . &quot;
the style of college is not , the communication states .
thus , the Medau family had already been informed &quot; in mid @-@ June orally about the advent of the university .
the statement that the plans were only known in July is definitely wrong , &quot; Pöl .
at the same time , he points out that the plans are not &quot; pre @-@ emption or even decisions , &quot; but that there are &quot; preferences . &quot;
the extension of the narrow road to the castle is also less dramatic than the Medaus feared .
from a nine @-@ metre wide road was and is not the talk .
it &apos;s going to be 5.50 meters to date , that &apos;s a metre wider than before , &quot; Pöl explains .
the argument of the medal operators that their free and school parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future will not be allowed to apply .
this will not be saved at all because , like other public parking places , this can now be resolved intelligently .
think of the residents
the children &apos;s crib Bergwichtel , which is on the site and on its doorstep would lead to the parking deck , is said to be &quot; not affected &quot; by the university president .
rather , he admits that &quot; this is not just about the crèche , but also about the residents at the entrance to the Friedrich @-@ Strib @-@ Straße and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school .
so it &apos;s all about much more than the vested interests of Mr Medau , &quot;
whether the criticism of the parent of the nursery , with the expansion of the road , would be &quot; justified &quot; by one of Coburg &apos;s few natural spots , the reader can decide himself . &quot;
at the beginning of October , Pöl , together with the State Building Office Bamberg , intends to inform the city councillors about the construction of the university by 2020 &quot; and in this context to address the importance of new development . &quot;
peer Medau last week informed parents of the nursery &apos;s plans .
this means that the access to the new parking deck should not , as has been the case with Campus and the Friedrich @-@ Strib @-@ Straße , but via the medu mountain .
the narrow road would have to be extended to about one kilometre long .
according to the Medaus &apos; projections , traffic in Hohenfel &apos;s park would be tenfold .
there is talk of about 2,000 vehicles every day .
the city did not want to comment on the project .
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old from the Bundesliga SG Flensburg @-@ Handewitt led out health problems for this decision .
the decision has not been easy for me , it has matured over several months .
it &apos;s time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team , &quot; the 2007 world champion told reporters on his Facebook page .
he thus takes stock of 167 country games and 576 goals for Germany in international retirement .
because the outspoken backroom player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg still wants to go on toboggan for a few years , he is now no longer available to new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson .
Glandorf held a &quot; long and good conversation with the Icelanders , who announced his cadre for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday .
his ideas and approaches have inspired me just as much as they will inspire my longtime co @-@ players and my successors .
but for my club I would also like to be healthy in the next few years , for which longer regeneration breaks are needed , which does not allow the current double burden .
the left @-@ hander had even been afraid of his career in 2012 after a heel infection .
because of Achilles &apos; problems , he had been treated by team doctors from the German Handball Federation ( DHB ) with a cortisonine injection that later triggered a strong inflammation .
an emergency operation and two other interventions followed .
then Glandorf announced a lawsuit against the team doctor , the confrontation ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and 11 years of national team careers go unscathed to any body .
I have some health buildings that I can no longer ignore .
after the three infectious foot operations , which took place at short intervals in 2012 , I have never properly broken my blood pressure .
there are a number of other wear @-@ related complaints .
even at the beginning of the year , I realised that while I &apos;m heading my head , I can &apos;t fool my body , &quot; Glandorf explained in the interview to Handball Time magazine .
for a comeback he would only be available in absolute emergency .
&quot; when all the strokes grab , I &apos;m always talking , &quot; the two @-@ time family friend told the trade magazine .
however , I can count on one hand the years in which I can still play handball .
I must also say that , after my long stay in hospital in 2012 , I have also become quite humble about my health .
after my career , I want to be able to go at least reasonably straight .
in addition to the 2007 World Cup title and winning the Champions League in 2014 , he won the EHF Cup in 2008 ( HSG Nordhorn ) and 2010 ( TBV Lemgo ) .
in 2012 , he also secured the Euro Cup victory with Flensburg .
German economy shrank 0.2 % in spring
the crises around the globe have slowed the German economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared with the previous quarter .
that told the Statistical Federal Office , confirming preliminary calculations .
consumption alone boosted the economy in the spring while investment declined .
foreign trade also slowed the economy .
thanks to the strong annual report , overall GDP growth for the first half of 2013 is 0.8 % compared to the second half of 2013 .
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the &quot; Münsterland Mooiste , &quot; which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday .
the castle town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch &quot; Fife riders &quot; on Sunday .
the largest cycling association in the Netherlands , NTFU , organised the so @-@ called &quot; Münsterlande Mooiste . &quot;
this is the largest cycle trip across Münsterland , the cycling paradise near the Netherlands .
more than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour through the Münsterland .
this tour has been advertised in various trade magazines .
we come from Den Helder and went overnight to take part in this tour .
we would like to get to know the Münsterland again in this way . &quot; the cyclists enjoyed the route through Steinfurt , Borken and Coesfeld .
after registration at the Vereinsheim des Schützenbruderschaft Sta .
Katharina went on a small &quot; peace drive &quot; through the city over Wall , where the launch took place .
further , the route , which was advertised for three different categories , headed towards manmade wood over the Schöppinger mountain towards Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 elevators , 120 kilometres with 1475 elevators and 145 kilometres with 1775 elevators , cyclists proved their good condition .
they were botched along the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck .
main organiser Jos ter Huerne and Mayor Heinz Lölfing were delighted at the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all those involved .
the organization was without problems and there were no negative incidents , &quot; says Heinz Lölfing , a positive conclusion of this event .
unfortunately , not as many participants as the organiser had hoped , which was probably due to poor weather forecasts and morning rain .
&quot; we see ourselves again in 2015 in hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend , &quot; the cyclists nevertheless promised to return to the Münsterland and the organisers plan to recharge .
Constantine Weckers ruthlessly honest memoir
it &apos;s actually more philosophical testimony than biography , which Constantin Wecker , Liedermacher , pacifist , politlessly activist , ex @-@ detainee , put on paper in &quot; monk and warriors &quot; on 287 pages .
not chronologically , but more mindsets for mind fences , the Munich @-@ born on June 1 , 1947 , wrote his memoir , each chapter initiated by a matching song text .
and he is ruthlessly honest : from onset to high school to shoplifting and drug use , he leaves no human weakness .
also , to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow men .
broad space also takes abstract but all the more important terms : love , soul , ego , being in the now , spirituality - all of which he tries to go to the bottom , in very philosophical but also very personal ways .
and he also explains his pacifism , his social critique , his political commitment - and also , as has shaped him not only the music ( the opera lover became a soul and rock musician ) , but also his prison stay .
the latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the asketic monk , which is &quot; created by subtraction , &quot; he says , &quot; by leaving everything unnecessary . &quot;
there are also short anecdotes between all the high mental views : about thugs in a locale frequented by GIs , or a crazy car ride , at which he visited a tree frontal .
here too , he is ruthlessly honest .
lenny Henry : my father never took me into the arm .
has never said &apos; I love you &apos;
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
his father , who died when Henry was 19 , worked in a factory and her relationship was limited .
Henry rehearsed for a comedy , Rudy &apos;s Rare Records , which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4 .
the soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
but Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments .
he attended &quot; many &quot; therapies after his mother &apos;s death , and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father .
it was hard to know him .
you never saw his face , just heard his voice : &quot; listen to the collar .
let your sister rest .
get away !
I want to watch cricket .
my older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things , such as the shape of beer lashing or the beauty of a cricket strike .
I never had such a conversation with him .
much of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper .
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley , and although conditions are better than at times of his father , he won a glimpse of how life had been for him .
it &apos;s a little brighter now , but they &apos;re dark , smoked , deep stymied labyrinth with flames and smoke and lots of soot .
my father used to just put himself in the tub and then you could slowly hear him sing as he began to sing because he could wash the foundry of himself .
when I ran around there , it became clear to me that he had done this for years to bring food on the table , and my respect for it became greater .
yet Henry grew up as a child without love certificates from his parents .
my father never embraced me , he never said &quot; I love you . &quot;
only when my mother went bad towards the end of her life did we start saying , &quot; I love you , I love you , I love you . &quot;
through his own daughter Billie , with Dawn French , he could share the love he had missed as a child .
could you stop with the &quot; I love you &quot; ?
stop hugging me !
dad , I &apos;m 22 !
with Dawn French .
why shouldn &apos;t we be friends ?
she &apos;s a great mother .
it &apos;s still friends with French , with whom he was married for 25 years .
Dawn is a good man .
why shouldn &apos;t we be friends ?
she &apos;s a great mother .
Henry &apos;s own mother was a diabetic .
that contributed to her death .
so when I became very , very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said &quot; you have to be radical .
so I moved this gym through and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
it &apos;s very hard .
and it &apos;s exhausting .
nobody likes to eat carrots .
Henry &apos;s career change may be evident in his elegant , short @-@ cut beard .
since he was praised by critics for his Othello , he has been captured by the theater .
it followed The comedy of errors , and then fences of August Wilson .
this is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that filled out his busy working life .
he started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him .
his television career began in the mid @-@ 1970s , &quot; I was the only black icon / comedian on television for a pretty long time . &quot;
he learned in the profession .
I had to learn not only from the eyes of the public but also from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke narrative machine while I was a star by television , and that was really difficult .
lenny 1975 at New Faces
since his manager owned the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel show , a light entertainment program where people &quot; painted black , &quot; Henry performed his comedy there over five years .
my family was very uncomfortable .
I somehow wished it never happened , but I don &apos;t regret that I did .
it was a strange , uncomfortable position for me , but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience .
but this &quot; year @-@ long award @-@ winning light pillar of British television &quot; was also a &quot; grotesque parody of black people . &quot;
by introducing figures that both mocked and celebrated British black culture , Henry worked in the Eighties on an alternative comedy circle .
the first series of the Lenny Henry show went on show in 1984 , and in the 1990s he was among others known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series boss !
advertising , documentaries , TV series and film roles premiered his next decade , but according to his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008 , he thought : &quot; what do you do next , Len , because it all feels like you just get the time or kick a little on the spot . &quot;
after that came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What &apos;s So Great About ... ?
the first episode turned around Shakespeare .
on Shakespeare I was really allergic .
I never really learned anything about him at school and kept him mostly for a middle @-@ class domain , whites in tights and a cabbage head in front .
so I was very afraid of it .
all we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench said &quot; You should try it .
don &apos;t make it bad if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
nimm a few of the words in your mouth , and then you &apos;ll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much .
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled .
I felt I could create that .
it was almost as if someone had finally put my head right .
&quot; that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about , it &apos;s a serious thing , nimm them seriously , send your text , researching a bit .
the samples were brutal , and I read this piece months before we made it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car accident , and that just didn &apos;t happen .
and soon he appeared in the comedy of the errors .
suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when I thought , &quot; Oh , you changed you . &quot;
there was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience .
&quot; a little voice told me , &quot; You have to bridge 10 minutes now while repairing the computer . &quot;
instead , the stage leader announced that the idea would continue once the problem has been resolved .
I went off the stage and anything in me said &quot; Oh , thank God . &quot;
I am not responsible for it .
I can leave that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
learning the text for Fences was challenging .
panic is very good , that strengthens the tendons .
that too came good , so it &apos;s like a big sign of the gods saying to me &quot; This here is your provision . &quot;
he says this , of course , with a thunderous voice .
so I stay there .
I really love that .
I love being in a sampling room .
Henry , though , still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has gone through humorous outbursts while repeatedly imitating people .
I decided not to make a stand @-@ up comedy because I think this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous .
if you look at this forever , you will drive off a wall .
I sometimes meet live in the Apollo when I want to do it , but overall it doesn &apos;t give me as much as before .
I ask him if he will ever make a stand @-@ up comedy tour again .
the fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a start , a middle part and the end of a trip - I don &apos;t think I ever want to give up that .
so is this his new incarnation here ?
I think so .
I &apos;m happy to be an actor .
it &apos;s fun .
you always tell a story , and that &apos;s great .
I love stories .
people love stories .
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen &apos;s capital
in the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government , the Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa .
Huthi supporters occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday , said a spokesman for the Huthi party &quot; Ansar Allah . &quot;
access to Parliament has also been blocked .
Yemeni media reports a traffic chaos in the capital .
according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; Yemen Post , &quot; Huthi leader Abdulmalik al @-@ Huthi called for the measures on Sunday night .
Huthi threatened , according to the leaf , with another escalation of the conflict , should his demands not be met .
Shiite Huthis is fighting for more independence from Sunni @-@ ruled Yemen , demanding the government &apos;s resignation .
the city of Huthi has been besieging the Yemeni capital for just two weeks .
about 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on Sanaa &apos;s big access routes .
bloody fighting with the Yemeni army continues to occur around the country .
Kenya registers officials to curb &apos; ghost words&apos;
Kenya has begun registering all state officials biometric to erase &quot; ghosts &quot; from the government &apos;s payrolls .
employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid , a government statement said .
the government suspects that thousands of people are still receiving salary payments even after their departure from the public service .
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in public service when he took office in 2013 .
at an audit earlier this year , it was found that at least $ 1 million ( £ 700,000 ) per month was lost in payments for &quot; ghosts &quot; and by other abusive financial practices .
the government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid out in accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service , Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi .
all officials now have to appear at identification centers in the next two weeks to ensure their data on biometric registrations is recorded in a government statement .
all those who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll , the communication went on .
&quot; this approach will contribute significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also by reassuring the payroll on both levels of government - so will the &quot; ghosts , &quot; said Anne Waiguru , the cabinet secretary at the Ministry of decentralisation and Planning .
the scandal involving art consultant Helge Achenbach will be negotiated in court for the first time on November 11 .
five heirs by Berthold Albrecht , son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht , are demanding 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at Düsseldorf Landgericht .
that told a court spokeswoman Monday .
the letter states that Achenbach cheated on buying artworks and vintage timers and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices .
as a result , the agreed commission was higher .
Achenbach bought value items for Albrecht for 121 million euros .
children need roots and wings
44 years he was in school service , 23 of them as school leaders .
from that time , Manfred Richter knows many roasted Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as students .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but always worn by his quest to see people in the student .
the snow is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains .
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his home .
judge was born in Trautenau / Northern Bohemia in 1930 , today Trutnov .
after four years of upper school , he was already interested in the teacher profession .
a year after that , the Sudetendeutsche were expropriated .
within half an hour , the family had to leave their house .
after a few months in a warehouse it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight waggon .
so it swallowed judges into the upper @-@ floor Senkendorf .
teacher education took place in Bamberg .
Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometres per week to the nearest train station , take the train to Bamberg , go to school three kilometres across the city and return in the evening .
after two months , Manfred Richter got a sleep opportunity in a Red Cross home in Bamberg : along with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory .
in 1951 , he made the second state exam after three years of teaching .
since Oberfranken had no free teaching skills for him , he went to Oberbayern and came to school in Kollbach on November 1 , 1954 .
the &quot; milling room &quot; was his first &quot; service apartment &quot; in the school house .
in 1958 , he received a three @-@ bedroom residence in the newly built teaching house next to the school .
this house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968 .
until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen @-@ Kollbach and five in Petershausen .
from the school year 1968 / 69 these were summarized in Petershausen in today &apos;s town hall .
when the school association Indersdorf was founded , only the primary school remained in place .
to escape a downgrade in the now smaller school , then @-@ rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsruhe - and Manfred Richter became his successor .
but Petershausen grew , and so the children and their teachers were able to obtain today &apos;s construction from September 1982 , which expanded in 1997 after Richters retired .
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz , who also built a work room on community costs and during enlargement in 1997 , although that was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings .
&quot; Mayor Götz was very culpable , &quot; Judge recalled grateful .
throughout his career , Manfred Justice has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who responded to a Department of a School on Law and Justice : &quot; you must never forget love . &quot; Manfred Richter set out what he had heard of as a young teacher .
&quot; you have to give the children two things : roots and wings , &quot; the 84 @-@ year @-@ old says .
and he had to find out : &quot; it doesn &apos;t always succeed , &quot; whether he means only his students or just his own six children is not entirely clear .
in any case , Justice Tun was sometimes unconventional .
when students checked out , they didn &apos;t complain of him doing any criminal work and were not thwarted to afterward .
at the expense of the congregation , judges had created two pairs of boxing gloves and left the two counterparties to each other , even if there should be a veil .
for the sake of the school , judges used a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) .
that moved the nonpartisan judge after his retirement to run at least as the last on the CSU list for the council in 1996 .
but judges were pre @-@ elected at six and joined the CSU .
180 kilometres in three days
hr4 @-@ RADTOUR 700 cyclists put in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scots stopovers
if cyclists make roast on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots , this in itself is nothing special .
on Friday , however , only the number of Rasterners made the impression : the 700 participants in the hr4 cycling tour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Schottener Alteburgpark .
under the motto of &quot; cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig , &quot; participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and witnessed a concert by Van Baker &amp; Band .
on Friday , it became serious : the cyclists took the first stage , going 60 kilometres over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and continuing to Scots .
in Bad Salzhausen , the athletes were greeted by Mayor Hans @-@ Peter seum , who was in Bad Vilbel by bicycle , and the head of the private enterprise Bad Salzhausen , Petra Schwing @-@ Döring .
for the refreshment of body and mind , all sorts of good things had been prepared : the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder @-@ Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple , cobblestone , streak and cheese pie , which were wonderfully munched to the brave cyclists .
&quot; these cakes can only bake land wives , &quot; praised one participant from Aulendiebach while calling for another play .
on the beverage side of the gym Geiß @-@ Nidda , cold refreshments could be obtained .
the &quot; Duo Bravo &quot; kept visitors with well @-@ known melodies from operas and musicals , and encouraged enthusiastic applause .
the beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing .
one Lord also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; he deserves it , after all , he has already reattached already bumped bike chains . &quot;
meanwhile , the mayor and the business manager had to work : they were interviewed at the well in front of the drinking house by reporter Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen .
promotional director Tobias Hagen , who has been a tour manager since the first hr4 cycling tour in 2004 , was able to take a short break , but had plenty to do with the technology on the ground .
his pickup truck , in which he communicated Hessen via three phones and a radio device with his staff and the 15 @-@ person motorcycle staffer , wrote Facebook entries and made reporters , also needed a check .
&quot; most of the participants come from the Rhine @-@ Main area , &quot; he said , &quot; but also from Gießen or Fulda , from Lauterbach or Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia , cyclists have travelled .
the number of participants depends a bit on the accommodation capacity available .
in category I participants are accommodated in hotels , in category II in collection accommodation .
from the resort , the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up again after one and a half hours : &quot; Chüss ! &quot;
&quot; it was nice in Bad Salzhausen ! &quot; she waved to leave .
after arriving in Scots , the group was allowed to take a short break .
but in the evening , cyclists were called to the idyllic Alteburgpark .
under the direction of the Schottener Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing ( GTS ) , the park had been given a nice fixed atmosphere and , of course , it had prepared leakage , such as flame pie with well @-@ cooled spring white .
Mayor Susanne Schaab , GTS managing director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC chairman Wolfgang Wagner @-@ Sachs welcomed visitors in his role as board member of ADAC Hessen @-@ Thüringen .
the three were visibly pleased with the &quot; many operations in Scots . &quot;
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage .
the opportunity to wander under the open sky was used diligently despite the sporting activity on the bike .
among the guests , citizens who were equally attracted by the good mood as well as the big char of cyclists .
on the second day , for cyclists the stations Birstein , Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the trendwoods - were on the program .
yesterday , after 180 kilometres of Radelns , athletes met again in Bad Vilbel .
dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for &apos; conspiracy &apos; against government
a total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of &quot; conspiracy against the government , &quot; local media agencies report .
police authorities gave no immediate comment .
among those arrested are 14 senior police officers , hurriyet Daily News reports .
some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government employees , including four government ministers last December .
in July , a number of Turkish police were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal association and tapping phone numbers .
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ( who was prime minister at the time ) described her actions as part of activities led by Islamist cleric Fethulla slums against him and other people in power positions .
not all children in Ukraine return to school
schools in Ukraine opened after summer holidays on Monday ( September 1 ) .
that day is traditionally an important day for families , and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents , Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school .
he told journalists there that not all schools had reopened , but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations :
the September celebrations were not held at any school .
the sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful sky .
the whole of Ukraine , a huge common Ukrainian grassroots front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
Aleksan Pastukhow , schoolteacher of the school in Slavjansk , who visits Jazenjuk &apos;s daughter , spoke on Russian .
we hope that peace will finally prevail here and that children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the future .
the first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated , with children wearing embroidered shirts , holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers .
with Rona Fairhead , the BBC may have found the great director it needs .
it meets with a proud fame slump from the banking world , media management and the inner circle of the Tory party .
and she has her own front experience .
her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co . , which she moved to Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , ICI and Pearson &apos;s media world .
she was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when Pearson &apos;s top post went to a younger male colleague .
her severance was reportedly nearly £ 1 million .
their political ranking is solid , too .
she was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne , BP &apos;s former chairman , when he searched for more private @-@ sector knowledge in Whitehall : she became the cabinet &apos;s adviser .
her husband is an early Tory Council member .
back in May , I described the chairman &apos;s job with a poisoned kelp .
not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
the trust acts in two directions : to the inside the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC , but also to the outside as a voice of public concern and unrest if things go wrong .
this ensures an almost untenable duopoly , which requires full reform .
but whatever incoming chairman would risk invading , beating on everything and disappearing an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while perhaps putting itself around his job .
it &apos;s a difficult task .
and as if that wasn &apos;t enough , many are still interested in seeing the BBC diminishing - power , money and status overtaken .
as competition moves closer and new technologies threaten old , comfortable collateral , the upcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is fraught with particular dangers .
for the modest sum of £ 145.50 a year , the British public is buying into the surely biggest media company in the world .
the BBC tells a good story : it says it reaches 96 per cent of all households and costs each of them just 40 pence a day .
and apparently the BBC is rising on the popularity scale again : 53 per cent support it today , compared to 31 per cent 10 years ago .
the viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed : I get news headlines on my mobile today and see missed programs later on my iPlayer .
but she remains a very beloved and considerable institution .
she needs a sizeable chairman - I hope she found him .
Perry from Texas says lowering tweet was not authorized
a tweet from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas , Rick Perry , on Sunday included a derogatory remark about the Democratic district attorney &apos;s office , which is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority .
the tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perry &apos;s user accounts , which dissipated the previous one .
a tweet has just been sent from my account , which was not authorized by me .
&quot; I don &apos;t approve of the tweet and deleted it , &quot; it said in the later news .
staff at Perry did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
although the tweets of Perry &apos;s official user account went out , it wasn &apos;t clear who actually serves the feed .
in the former tweet , an unfavorable image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg , was drawn in April 2013 for drunken driving .
Perry vetoed a financial promotion of her office when she refused to resign , leading to a charge against Perry - who may be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury this month in Austin .
the text of the tweet reads : &quot; I don &apos;t always ride drunk with the triple permitted alcohol level ... but if I do , I dress Governor Perry when he splurge it . &quot;
I &apos;m the most drunken Democrat in Texas .
Lehmberg &apos;s office was not charged with leading the grand jury &apos;s investigation against Perry .
this was led by Michael McCrum , a special prosecutor from San Antonio , who was selected by a Republican judge .
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charge a political ploy .
his high @-@ ranking team of legal counsel asked the judge charged with the case to dismiss the indictment and argued that the law , which is against the longest @-@ serving governor in the history of the state of Texas , is unaccounted for .
Perry stopped $ 7.5 million of government money to the state &apos;s Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and is investigating in cases of government corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign .
this veto caused a public complaint from a leftist Watchdog group .
Perry &apos;s official account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous .
having finished as a fifth at the election meetings in Iowa during his 2012 presidential run , Perry went on to speculate that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photograph of himself while jogging near a lake , with the words &quot; South Carolina , we come ! &quot;
Berkeley declares housing market back for &apos; normal &apos;
one of London &apos;s most prominent builders pointed out that the housing market in the south @-@ east of England had &quot; returned to normal levels . &quot;
homes in the capital were hotly coveted and subject to huge price increases , prompting the Bank of England to set limits on mortgage lending in June because of widespread fears of a credit bubble .
Tony Pidgley , founder and chief executive of the highly @-@ rated construction company Berkeley said Monday : &quot; since the start of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013 , &quot; adding that this provides a &quot; stable hand environment . &quot;
the property market in London was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital .
according to information from the Qatar Office , prices in the city area rose by 18.5 per cent last year alone , far more than the average increase in England and Wales overall .
average sales prices at Berkeley &apos;s private , inexpensive and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year and were up by £ 423,000 at the end of April .
however , a stronger pound has made property ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible &quot; residential tax &quot; ahead of next May &apos;s general election .
London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April , which unveiled tougher lending arrangements , would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year .
new data from the Bank of England Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July , which also suggests that the property market is cooling .
Hamptions International , another real estate agency , corrected its forecast for the rise in property prices in London for 2015 down to 3 per cent , based on an already debilitating house price awareness .
transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea , Mayfair and Kensington has now fallen by a quarter year on year , according to broker WA Ellis .
still , the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing , as the due amounts for futures sales amount to more than £ 2.2 billion .
Mr Pidgley added : &quot; demand for the right , well @-@ planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result , futures sales have also remained stable . &quot;
in June , the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - nearly a third more than the peak in 2007 before the crisis .
annual pre @-@ tax profit rose 40 percent annually to £ 280 million , sales up 18 percent to £ 1.6 billion .
in a statement Monday before the company &apos;s annual meeting , Mr Pidgley said that revenue for Berkeley in the current year was expected to match current market expectations .
analysts estimate the annual pre @-@ tax profit to be £ 450 million .
Berkeley shares were fixed at £ 23.96 in London trading in the afternoon .
naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence &apos;s appearance at the 85th anniversary ceremony .
naked photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were released online by a hacker who claimed to have a &quot; masterlist &quot; of pictures of another 100 starlets .
a representative of the star from &quot; The Tribute of Panem &quot; confirmed that Lawrence &apos;s photos were real and complained to the hacker about &quot; blatant violation of privacy . &quot;
authorities have been notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence .
the photos , originally posted on the photo @-@ sharing site 4chan , were allegedly obtained by a gap in Apple &apos;s online storage system icloud .
it &apos;s not certain how many of the images are real , though Winstead , star of &quot; Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world &quot; on Twitter , also condemned the hack .
&quot; to those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are so satisfied with you , &quot; Winstead wrote on Twitter .
however , Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series &quot; iCarly &quot; and &quot; Victorious &quot; denied that the photos were pictures of her handels and tweetete &quot; These so @-@ called nude images of me are fake , people .
let us resist the beginnings . * Worlds intended * .
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her .
exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson &apos;s highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter &quot; J . &quot;
they shattered , so you could best describe it , they slowly broke up like a cardboard that you have in the rain .
occasionally , a woman told him he was too serious , exhausting , intense , distanced and perhaps somewhat scratched .
and then shake his hand .
he knew kratzbrush .
he was stunned , as in Igel , yes .
the last victim of this rigour was a just beginning affair that had been more promising for a relief to the lone boredom of his life than usual , and perhaps even given him some satisfaction .
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling tender beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the north island that was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben .
she had come to the south with an older escort , which Kevern thought was her aunt , and which had inherited a plot in a damp but paradisial valley called Paradise Valley .
for several years , no one had lived in the house .
the pipes were leak , in the baths were still spiders , neck scarves had left their marks on all windows and believed they belonged to all of them , and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge coal heads .
it was like the house from a children &apos;s fairytale , both threatening and tempting , a garden full of secrets .
portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel &quot; J &quot; is on the longlist for the Man Booker Award in 2014 .
the shortlist will be announced next week .
Kevern had sat with Ailinn hanging on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon .
your feet are too big .
because of their great aggressiveness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
not banned - nothing was so properly banned - just didn &apos;t play .
it was successfully obsolete , just as the word obsolete .
the general taste created what earlyness and regulations would never have done , and how people choose the Vom @-@ Tellerwasscher @-@ zu @-@ Millionaire memoirs , cookbooks and love romance on books , they chose the ballads at the music .
in the euphoria of the day , Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and in a roughly comic Serenade Ailinns big feet .
Ailinn didn &apos;t understand that .
&quot; this was a well @-@ known song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller , &quot; he explained to her and automatically put two fingers to his lips .
that had always done his father to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth .
it had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had played it with his own father , so he had been told .
when you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips , it costs you a penny .
it wasn &apos;t a very funny game at the time , and it wasn &apos;t very funny either now .
he knew this was expected of him , that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
Ailinn had never heard of .
jazz was not played , even if he wasn &apos;t directly banned .
improvising was no longer modern .
it was only room for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
people wanted to be quite sure at the start of a tune where it would end .
likewise the mind .
his unpredictability made people nervous .
and jazz was musically excited mind .
although he had become 10 years old without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior , Kevern knew something about jazz from his father &apos;s half @-@ secret collection of old CDs .
but at least he didn &apos;t need to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black .
at her age , she probably couldn &apos;t remember a time when pop singer wasn &apos;t black .
again , no laws or constraints apply .
a compliant society meant that every element of this society thankfully agrees with the principle of group talent - thankful as those of fate .
people with African @-@ Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temperament and body construction , so they sang and ran .
people who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent , as by nature , and were with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a working phone .
what was left of the Polish community was concerned about sewerage ; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates .
those from the Gulf states and the Levante , whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WAS HEALTH WAR , WENN ES HEALTH WAR - fearing to be indicted for fire @-@ fighting - were even opened up for fear that the flames would eat them next - Labha restaurants .
everyone according to his skills .
since she had only heard ballads , Ailinn found it hard to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just pre @-@ sung her could ever be spared .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they &apos;re not really offensive , &quot; Kevern said .
except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
my father never offended anyone , but he loved that song .
he retreated too much , but the neglected garden gave him the elusive sense of security .
nothing could overcome the sound insulation of huge carbon sheets .
Ailinn still didn &apos;t understand .
why would your father have loved something like this ?
he wanted to say it was a Jux , but hesitated to put two fingers to the lips in her present .
she already thought he was something strange .
&quot; it seemed funny to him , &quot; he said instead .
she shakes ungrateful her head and blocked Keverns &apos; view .
there was nothing more to see around the world than her uncut rash hair .
there was nothing he would have wanted to see otherwise .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; she said without conviction .
but that doesn &apos;t explain why you prefer it to me .
she seemed honest .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet so directly do not .
maybe your ankle , a small bit ...
and you say you hates me because my ankles are too thick ?
hate you ?
of course I don &apos;t hate you .
that &apos;s just the silly song .
he could have said &quot; I love you , &quot; but for that it was too early .
&quot; your thick ankles are exactly the reason you fake me , &quot; he tried to do it instead .
I &apos;m a bit perverse .
that didn &apos;t sound right .
it had been funny .
when he tried to be funny , he often got into trouble because , like his father , he didn &apos;t have the soothing charm you needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes .
perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel .
maybe he wanted to be , Kevern , that .
despite his friendly eyes .
Ailinn Solomons was red and raised from her deck chair , threw the console around and gave away the wine they had drunk .
Holunderflower wine , so drunken was no excuse for him .
in her exuberance , she seemed to tremble like Palmwedel in the storm .
&quot; and your thickhead is exactly why I feel perverse to you , &quot; she said ...
except that I &apos;m not at all .
she was sorry , both because of the unnecessary unease of his words and the fear that emerged in her eyes when she opposed him .
did she think he would beat her ?
she had not told him of life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here .
the same huge and ice @-@ cold ocean broke here as there on the shore .
the same confused men , with even thicker skin and dizzy after DEM WAS HEALTH WAR when it was their ancestors as smugglers and beach predators , moved from pub to pub , always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or lamented them .
Dickhead ?
they would have shown her a big fist if she didn &apos;t fit up !
they only crunch - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women , a antidote to the non @-@ existent love ballads from the console - they only crisp and then beat .
according to Keverns , this was an unnecessary refinement , since the Knutsche himself was already an act of violence .
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body .
he rose out of the berth like an old man .
she also felt bleeding , but the brunt of his grief surprised her .
this was not the end of the world .
they hardly knew .
she looked at him as he removed - just as from a room on the upper floor her companion gave him in - a man , complained by something he had summoned himself .
Adam leaves the garden , she thought .
she felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised her hands against her .
a man turned away from her , his back bowed , embarrassed , defeated , without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight she seemed to know well if she could not remember a single time she had seen something like that before today ?
when she was alone again , Ailinn blew Solomons on her feet .
several years before the incidents that have just occurred , Esme Nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32 @-@ year @-@ old researcher on behalf of Ofnow , the non @-@ legislative monitoring body for the public mood , worked on a brief lecture on continued violence at a low and medium @-@ level level in exactly the parts of the country where they were not expected to be abolished .
&quot; a lot has already been done , and much has yet to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them , particularly in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been seen despite the high @-@ rise cherries .
but some properties pose themselves as unexploitable .
the higher the church tower , it seems , the lower the passion it continues to awaken .
the population wears sentimental ballads while listening to stories about over @-@ wrenching difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life , but not only does the former crude keep rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in hand , but there is evidence of the emergence of a new playing field .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate , &quot; her mentor said when he read the entire report .
I suggest you read less novels .
ESME Nussbaum cut her head .
I also have to ask : are you atheist ?
&quot; I think I don &apos;t have to say that , &quot; Esme Nussbaum replied .
are you lesbian ?
once again , Esme regretted her right to privacy and denial of testimony .
feminist ?
silence again .
&quot; I don &apos;t ask that , &quot; Luther Rabinowitz said eventually , &quot; because I would be against atheism , lesbian or feminism .
this is a prehistoric job .
we serve a non @-@ prejudice society .
but certain types of hypersensitivity , which in itself are absolutely acceptable and commendable , can occasionally distort results as you have presented them .
you yourself obviously have prejudices against the church , and these things that you call &quot; faint &quot; and &quot; raw &quot; could be interpreted by others as just as well as an expression of a natural force and vitality .
if you continue along the road , WAS HEALTH IS , WENN ES HEALTH IS , as if it had happened yesterday , means taking the country its essential vitality .
ESME Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke .
behind his head , an LED writer in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter @-@ century or longer .
smile to her neighbour , value her partner , listen to ballads , visit musicals , use her phone , speak , explain , listen to , vote , apologize .
speaking is better than silence , the healthy word is better than the written one , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; I absolutely understand what you want to do , &quot; Esme Nussbaum replied with a quiet voice when she was sure her pre @-@ legislator had spoken to the end , &quot; and I say nothing more than that we have not yet healed as effectively as we do ourselves .
my concern is that , without warning , we may be able to find out how we repeat the mistakes that have led to THE WAS HEALTH IS .
this time , however , it is not the others on which we leave out our anger and distrust .
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands .
to indicate an engelspatient .
&quot; you go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if you describe acts as &quot; mistakes &quot; that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
they also go too far when you talk about them leaving their &quot; rage &quot; and their &quot; mistrust &quot; to &quot; others . &quot;
in fact , it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are talking about &quot; us &quot; and &quot; others &quot; when understanding the past and protecting the present .
there was no &quot; we &quot; and there were no &quot; others . &quot;
it was a time of disorder , that &apos;s all we know .
&quot; from the if we &apos;re honest with ourselves , &quot; Even joked , &quot; no part of society can claim to have behaved well .
I don &apos;t care .
whether it &apos;s been done badly or well , what happened has happened .
that was then .
nothing has to be said about this - we agree .
and , just as no fault must be assigned , no fault must be blamed if such a repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to wipe it out .
but what does the past serve if we do not learn from it -
the past serves to forget them .
if I may say something about this ,
Luther Rabinowitz dropped his pyramid .
&quot; I will consider her report , &quot; he said , and relieved her .
the next day , when she went to work as usual , she was overrun by a motorcyclist who , as passers @-@ by described , was driving in a kind of &quot; brutal rage &quot; on the footpath .
coincidences exist .
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned ; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
official representatives of the military in Lesotho denied planning a coup to overthrow the government and said they opposed policemen accused of arming political fanatics .
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and told them that the country &apos;s army was rattling its official residence and occupying government buildings in the capital Maseru .
the prime minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after he reported assault threats .
military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was de facto no coup , but that the military responded to the threat posed by &quot; political fanatics &quot; whose arming was imminent by police .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the baton of Lesotho &apos;s defense forces acted after receiving several intelligence reports that within the police some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political , bipartisan young fanatics who were about to cause devastating harm , &quot; he said to Voice of America .
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action made the impression of an upheaval .
&quot; even though no one has claimed to have torn the government by force itself , all reports agree that Lesotho &apos;s activities so far show signs of a coup , &quot; he said .
spokesmen for Lesotho &apos;s military told reporters Sunday that the soldiers were stepping back into their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm .
meanwhile , Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over governance during Thabanes &apos; absence .
Thabane announced that he believes he has become the target for his attempt to combat corruption in the country .
there have been major tensions in Lesotho since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings because of the clashes in his unity government .
he said his actions had not undermined the government , other lurking accusations of comfort .
eurozone manufacturing at a 13 @-@ month low
the rise in output in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point of the past 13 months in August , according to a closely watched study .
the final Markit purchasing managers &apos; index of manufacturing ( PMI ) fell to 50.7 in August , according to a stand of 51.8 in July .
an indication above 50 indicates an expansion .
new orders declined and factories experienced breakthroughs at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
the figures meet before the European Central Bank ( ECB ) meeting on Thursday .
markets expect the bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a sluggish eurozone recovery , as well as for looming deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3 % .
there is speculation that the head of the ECB , Mario Draghi , could provide further information later this week on whether to consider quantitative relief for the eurozone , according to those made by Britain and the US during the financial crisis .
&quot; although small growth is better than no growth at all , the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers , &quot; said Rob Dobson , senior economist at Markit .
the factory PMI for Germany , Russia &apos;s largest trading partner in the EU , fell to its lowest level in 11 months , with 51.4 .
meanwhile , in the bloc &apos;s second @-@ largest economic nation , France , the PMI fell to 46.9 .
France remains a sorority , as well as Italy &apos;s descent from solid expansion to stagnation .
hints that growth incentives in key industrial markets will no longer affect Germany , Spain and the Netherlands are also not reassuring , &quot; said Mr Dobson .
the decline in industry probably fueled the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus .
positive news came from the Republic of Ireland , where the PMI rose to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Archer , chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight , said : &quot; the best thing to say for the purchasing managers &apos; index of manufacturing in the euro zone in August is that after that , the sector continues to grow . &quot;
he added : &quot; producers in the eurozone currently find life quite difficult , as current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine - are increasing uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries .
these heightened uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - particularly , and consumer confidence , and presumably lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled , especially large orders .
he said that it was &quot; increasingly likely &quot; that the ECB would eventually have to initiate some kind of QE &quot; although we suspect this will be limited . &quot;
the centenary of Beslan &apos;s survivors : ten years have passed since the school &apos;s horrible siege , as the children in it are still suffering today .
ten years ago , over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan in southern Afghanistan .
more than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three @-@ day martyrdom that shocked the world .
we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped the death at the Greueltat in the classroom .
exactly a decade after the horrific siege of Beslan &apos;s school , where 334 people were killed , including 186 children , the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night .
when fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1 , 2004 , the start of a new school year , that seemed like the bad thing .
the tragedy united West and East in disgust , and then , surprisingly , turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery .
ten years later , we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death at the Greueltat in the classroom .
we found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , even though the memory of these terrorist hell will follow them forever .
their greatest hope ?
that the war that is now afflicting Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now ending .
the girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the smashed school sports hall
she was photographed by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famous when she tried only in her underwear to climb back into the smashed school gym after a mine exploded .
completely confused , Aida searched for her mother Larissa , now 40 years old .
both were deemed dead but they survived .
&quot; one woman told me I should run around my life , but I couldn &apos;t , &quot; Aida said at the time .
my legs were bleeding .
I stood up and climbed back to look after my mother .
a soldier brought them to safety .
after a series of operations , she considered herself completely cured , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago the pain returned .
I fear that I will have to continue to operate again .
some grenade shells are still in my knee .
her goal now is to become a dentist to help people see how her was helped by doctors .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it didn &apos;t break me apart , &quot; she says battling .
&quot; that happened to me and you can &apos;t change that .
once a year , I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there .
my friends and I try not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
we played together when we were small , and dreamed of going together to school .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career .
I think of a family later .
she says the siege will always remain a part of it , although the memory becomes a little bit weak every year .
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere .
when I look online at the photo of me as I climb back to school , I think a lot of people see it for the first time , understand our disaster and help not to happen again .
the boy who fled the ball hail in the opinion that his mother was dead
it was his first day of school ( Russians go to school with 7 years ) and survived the three @-@ day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara .
as a seven @-@ year @-@ old , he said , &quot; Mama told me I should sit down if there was an explosion , and keep her hand . &quot;
after an explosion , he thought she would die .
she said to him : &quot; run . &quot;
full of fear she could be dead , he fled and saw on the way a crying infant , grabbed it at hand and fled through a ball hail .
his father , Vladimir , who closed his son outside in the arms , said : &quot; Damir told me that his mother had died .
he said : &quot; I couldn &apos;t save them . &quot;
in reality , Tamara was stabbed outside and with leg injuries in hospital , in turn assuming that her son had died .
after her reunification , she said : &quot; I wept before joy .
I couldn &apos;t believe it .
he ran in and hugged me .
Damir was later flown to London ( from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World ) to receive the title of a Barnardo &apos;s Children &apos;s Champion from then @-@ Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie .
&quot; this horror follows you every day , but I wish I could stop with the remembrance , &quot; he said yesterday .
but I can say that in my memory it will be blurry .
I still know I threw away all my toy guns right after that .
but now I can play computer games with sound scenes and that &apos;s not a problem for me .
&quot; I &apos;m not afraid to go back to the gym , but I don &apos;t think about myself .
I remember those kids with whom I played in the yard and who didn &apos;t get it out .
we never say they were killed or dead .
we say they stayed in the gym .
I remember very well my trip to London , especially to the toy shop where I was able to look out for everything I wanted , and the ride in a top open car .
but now he &apos;s scared of place like Ukraine , where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered .
this horror follows you every day , but I wish I could stop reminding myself of it .
&quot; I &apos;m so sorry for all those suffering from the greats , &quot; said Damir , who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week .
I like to help .
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year .
his mother Tamara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighborhood have been killed , can you imagine this ?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege , there were just no children who could call and walk around , and that silence lasted many months .
she remembers vividly her trip to London with Damir .
the people of London wept when I told our story .
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support .
she was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004 .
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed , but I still remember the meeting me and her husband in London , and how the Damir and me helped .
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch and call them all local Russian restaurants .
I remember playing with waitresses in a restaurant , Damir shot with his water pistols on them and they ran away and played with him .
and that was just a month after the horror .
I was surprised that Britons so readily shared our pain and supported us .
she said : &quot; I always think this world hasn &apos;t gotten better in these 10 years .
in Ukraine , the war continues now , and people die every day , and I believe many children have been killed and are still killed .
these are just such children as ours .
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else .
I just know what these people feel , the whole horror .
and I can &apos;t stop feeling that .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and that &apos;s so sad .
Damir became great and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he &apos;s not aggressive or angry at all .
he &apos;s not looking for revenge , for example , he &apos;s not overwhelmed by the past greats .
I know he doesn &apos;t like to remember it , but he has six close friends from class and they occasionally go to the gym and ignite candles there .
when he was smaller , he suffered - I remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa , turned off the face of us , for hours .
not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I also remember how he continued to throw all his weapons and other military toys .
I can hardly believe I was so sure for some hours that he was dead and I would never see him again .
when I recovered after the explosion and came to my feet , I looked around , and saw the hell around me , with everywhere body parts .
I was absolutely sure my little boy could have survived in this hell impossible .
&quot; I remember that I gave him back , &quot; Damir , running , running away , &quot; but I was also so sure he hadn &apos;t heard me .
but he heard it and he ran away .
and so life , unlike many others , continues for us .
Georgij Ilyin , 17
the boy , whose horrible image became a symbol of Beslan &apos;s Greuel
consolation : the Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 siege , right a picture of Georgij today
his bloodied face was characterized by fear as he ran around his life , while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates .
his image was one of Beslan &apos;s most shocking symbols .
his mother , Fatima , 54 , a doctor , had dropped him for his first day of school before rushing away to bring her older son Vladimir to university .
&quot; I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him , and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone , &quot; she recalls .
not entirely alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
only my Georgiy managed to survive .
the closer this date , the harder it is to think about it and talk about it .
there is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy .
we don &apos;t think it &apos;s a long time ago , I mean it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from those days tracking me forever .
nobody will ever forget that , I promise you .
forceful : the image of Georgij ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalised as a statue ( right ) .
I remember Georgij wanting to go to school on that day , saying he wanted to embrace his teacher .
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on television .
and now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino .
Georgij doesn &apos;t like to see the picture , and it &apos;s hidden at home in the bookshelf .
I understand that , but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image .
Georgij says today : &quot; it &apos;s important this can never happen again .
&quot; I doubt we &apos;ll ever know the truth .
people keep investigating such tragedies and never learn the truth .
and now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine .
will we ever find out what caused him ?
this world is becoming a terrible world .
&quot; I can &apos;t understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , nobody wants a war , so how does that happen ?
ten years is nothing in this pain .
we need dozens of years to forget it a little bit .
it has attacked my health and I still feel it .
for about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege , but then it got better .
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day .
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed .
that &apos;s why I always go to the gym when September 1 moves closer .
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends .
it &apos;s hard for me to go into the sports hall , but I have to do it .
I don &apos;t feel as a victim , this story is now part of my past .
I &apos;m not going to forget it , but I &apos;m not sorry .
my life continues .
I completed the school this year and attend a medical college in Vladikawkaz .
I &apos;ll become a heart surgeon .
my first choice was training in the army .
I wanted to become a soldier , but my health didn &apos;t allow that .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that won &apos;t happen .
Georgij Faniyev , 20
the boy who survived despite being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
a miracle : Georgij Faniyev was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege , but he managed to survive .
during the siege , he was caught in the gym and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it &apos;s really a miracle he wasn &apos;t killed .
&quot; we feel like it was yesterday , &quot; says Georgij , who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer , but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege .
it &apos;s still with me , it &apos;s nothing I &apos;ve left behind .
I &apos;m older now and people say that kids can easily handle bad experiences - I have to say that &apos;s not true .
&quot; in 2006 I worked with psychologists and I actually felt a little better after that , but I can &apos;t forget it .
and I &apos;d love to forget .
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym .
I lost consciousness .
I will never return there and ask me not to show you where I sat in this famous picture .
survivor : Georgij Faniyev today , with a photo of herself in hospital after siege on the laptop
my pain is tremendous and I wear him with me every day .
my friends know I don &apos;t like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about the school .
physically , I do well .
I should be careful with my injured knee , but I can run well now .
but because of my health , I could not study the FSB &apos;s intelligence academy in St Petersburg as I wanted .
I have sent my documents , including medical agents , and they have replied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I &apos;ve been there two years behind me .
he learns the treatment of all animals &quot; from cats to cows . &quot;
he said : &quot; I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences .
children should know nothing about this and they should not , of course , suffer it .
his mother Marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain never leaves me .
he is in my soul , worse when the anniversary moves closer .
I will go to the celebrations for commemoration .
I know that Georgij will not go .
it has to be much more intense for him because he was there and I don &apos;t .
I waited at home for him and couldn &apos;t help .
I am so grateful to God that he has been returned to me .
it remains in us .
Georgij is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept this if something like this is so unfair .
he &apos;s a boy , he likes sport , but he can &apos;t attend because of his knee .
he has operated several times , he can run , but no sport .
I would say that he has overcome the horror at 50 % , but you can never completely overcome it and forget it .
this terrible experience will always follow us .
many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and this only reinforces my pain .
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were expensive to me .
my son is with me , and this is the greatest gift that God could make me , but my heart wept around the slain .
I know of families where new children were born , but also of widows who never married again .
it is hard to accept that life goes on , even if you don &apos;t want it .
I &apos;ll never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in hospital .
and now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why do they kill each other ?
the war is very close to our country now and I almost cannot believe it .
we used to be a friendly country , how can we fight now ?
people and children suffer , I am sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still killed .
if we could only attack and throw out all of these rebels - as far away as possible .

the baby , who was so horrified by a special operations squad in safety
saved : Aljona Tskajewa is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command ( left ) .
she is now 10 ( right ) and doesn &apos;t remember the cruelties at all
the world held its breath in 2004 , when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan .
the terrorists allowed them to go , but kept in their cruelty their 30 @-@ year @-@ old mother , 10 @-@ year @-@ old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in school sports .
Makhar , then three years old , escaped , but Aljona &apos;s mother and sister died in the murderous carnage .
her father , Ruslan , has since married again and , with his new wife , Swetlana , he has called Kristina after his lost daughter .
Aljona , now 10 years old , does not recall the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl , neighbors say .
&quot; they are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children , &quot; says a close friend .
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary .
you &apos;ll understand why .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
if you like to take photos or videos underwater , there is a selection of devices .
the cheapest option is a waterproof point @-@ and @-@ shoot , like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action Cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition , both of which are available for about $ 300 .
I took these photos at a family festival with several cameras , all available at a price of under $ 350 .
regardless of the equipment , there are a few rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are close .
place your camera on the photos or videos you want to take .
some cameras and camcorder have scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for the temperate underwater conditions .
and before you jump in , check to what depth your equipment is functional .
some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
in our purchasing guide , search for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
make multiple shots - because many won &apos;t fold .
point @-@ and @-@ shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images , action cams normally do not .
even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to see this underwater , and the right image setting is a good thing .
so make a lot of shots .
if your camera has a row mode that makes a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings , use it .
stay close to the surface .
the light becomes dramatically worse , the further you move away from the surface .
so , if possible , stay close to the surface when you make shots in a pool , lake or sea .
this allows you to add more color to your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects .
this is also a good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of poor light conditions .
it is particularly important when you work with an action cam : these devices often have a fixed wide @-@ angle lens , which means that you have to come to your objects more tightly if they are to fill out the entire picture frame .
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things , even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS .
as a consultant anesthesiologist , he devoted his career to saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the anesthesia of treatment .
among his patients , his wife recalls , was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture .
Lawson knew doctors were important to diagnoses and diseases , while the treated were mostly busy with something very different : pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose suffering started .
&quot; I didn &apos;t feel like that , &quot; he wrote in May this year .
I had trouble getting up .
while he struggled with the flu @-@ like symptoms , he noted that he made impatient allegations to his wife Juliet .
&quot; I want everything right now rather than later , &quot; he noted .
when Juliet was on a business trip for a week , Lawson felt quite unusual and uneasy .
something was in the air .
he asked a colleague to conduct an X @-@ ray examination of his chest .
only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps .
the results of the X @-@ ray investigation were available .
he suffered from mesothelioma , an incurable cancer that attacks the chest , that is , the lungs of exaggerating skin .
as with most cancers , the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine .
for example , while some smokers are diagnosed with lung cancer , not all lung cancer patients have previously been smokers .
but Mesotheliom is different .
in almost all cases , the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre , which was once considered to be a &quot; miracle substance &quot; but has now been identified as deadly .
for most of us , Mesotheliom is a disease that can ignore how easily .
asbestos is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous asbestos type has not been used in Britain since the 1960s , when industry volunteered to stop using it .
even where he was still used , only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers , construction workers , room workers and shipyard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazard from another time , it seems to be hardly worrying today .
but this complacency is inappropriate .
Britain , it seems , is experiencing the peak of a mesolthelioma today .
there are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,500 deaths a year , twice as many people die from this disease than from road accidents .
annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and likely future deaths in Britain
the reason we are seeing the deadly effects now , although asbestos has been illegal for years ( all asbestos types were banned in 1999 ) is that a mesothelioma is only developing after decades .
and the scourge of the mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry .
asbestos was , and is often still , present in the houses where we live , the offices where we work , the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop .
and therefore Mesotheliom knows no class barriers , financial limits , professions or age .
the privileged bastions , from the elegant department stores in London to private schools , are not a shelter .
Parliament buildings are amply contaminated .
even in hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy , this deadly carcinogens have already been used as a starting point .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
he wasn &apos;t a plumber either .
it actually fell hard for him to imagine where he might have been in contact with asbestos .
then he found it out .
&quot; it looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy &apos;s Hospital , where I graduated for six years , &quot; he wrote .
all - students , nurses , doctors and Pförtner - use the tunnels .
you wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease ?
unfortunately , he was able to answer that question in part .
&quot; of the four doctors trained at Guy &apos;s Hospital , and who have contracted Mesotheliom in the last five years , &quot; he wrote in a letter in 2010 , &quot; I &apos;m the last to live . &quot;
how many of us will get sick ?
at Andrew Lawson , Mesotheliom was diagnosed at age 48 .
when he died on February 17 this year , he was 55 .
this was an unusually long survival period .
fifty percent of all knife victims die within 8 months of diagnosis .
the disease always ends deadly .
so we can only repeat Lawson &apos;s question : &quot; how many of us will get sick ? &quot;
the UK &apos;s leading expert on mesothelioma , Professor Julian Peto , notes that between 1870 and 2050 , when the asbestos premium in Britain is expected to be stalled , a total of 90,000 of the disease will have fallen victim .
most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this .

a short look at the files of the courts to which those concerned frequently turn for damages claims shows how far the scourge of the mesothelioma has already spread .
in June this year , Marks &amp; Spencer admitted , for example , that Janice Allen was negligently exposed to asbestos .
she worked for the chain for nine years , from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years ago when she began her work at M &amp; S .
now she has two children in the twenties .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; she says , &quot; I had never heard of Mesotheliom , I didn &apos;t really know anything about asbestos yet .
I never thought that would affect me .
there are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
the fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance but to a group of six minerals .
the name stems from the word &quot; Asemform , &quot; a description of the fibre structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in construction .
Chrysotil , also known as white asbestos , is now by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings .
it was used for roof plates , floor panels , pipe isolations , boiler insulation , even for brake blades in cars .
it is less deadly than other forms of asbestos , but it is still seen by the EU and WHO as a &quot; major health risk &quot; with possible death .
however , the brown asbestos and blue asbestos ( Krokydolith ) are more dangerous .
Britain was once the world &apos;s largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that &quot; there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a main reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates . &quot;
an employee of Marks &amp; Spencer was suspended at the flagship store in Oxford Street , London , Asbest
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical knife victim , but Julian Peto &apos;s work suggests that her story is by no means unusual .
he has presented a study by those affected , which shows that &quot; a significant proportion of mesothelioma without known suspension was probably caused by work or in the home by asbestos contact in the environment . &quot;
most of these contacts are based on the &quot; normal use and aging &quot; of our buildings .
it looks like no one can assume to be safe .
a report by Goddard Consulting , which examined Westminster &apos;s palace , shows how people might have been unwittingly exposed to the substance even in the heart of the government .
in 2009 , Goddard reported that service forces and pipe lines were contaminated behind Parliament &apos;s committee rooms with asbestos , whose deadly fibers could be upset by something as benign as &quot; strong air movements . &quot;
MPs are often accused of caring for their own interests , but here it looks like the opposite .
while the board of the Parliamentary Labor Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a &quot; clean health certificate , &quot; it is now undisputed that £ 1 billion of work needs to be raised over several years to renovate parliament , modernize electric installations and remove asbestos , and that after the general elections , MPs are more likely to meet in nearby 2015 .
the Goddard report also pointed out that &quot; the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the respective provisions . &quot;
no one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives .
all you can do now is wait .
one person who could never accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott , a general health practitioner .
like Andrew Lawson , 50 @-@ year @-@ old Abbott suspects he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals .
&quot; I worked in a hospital where asbestos lawsuits were positively decided , &quot; he says , &quot; but I can &apos;t prove it in my case .
it &apos;s so difficult to remember all the places where you &apos;ve worked , and the data .
what he remember is the day in early December 2009 , when he got such a fever .
he was 45 , and performed an operation just late in the evening .
suddenly I had shaking frost .
it came quite suddenly .
I felt terrible .
I believed the drive home no longer created .
as a doctor , Mr Abbott knew that the pain from the chest , the skin around his lungs was sticking .
but like Janice Allen , he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma .
he didn &apos;t go to work a month .
astonished doctors made X @-@ ray shots of his chest and set Pleurakathether to extract liquid from the lungs and test it in the lab .
his complaints , however , remained without diagnosis .
his health improved slowly and he returned to his workplace .
from time to time , however , symptoms returned , often after sporting activity and severe breathing .
in 2011 , a patient arrived with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma .
but , even now , Abbott does not associate this with his own case .
after all , his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
the connection in the case was clear .
in September 2011 , Abbott &apos;s condition deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X @-@ rays to an expert group .
in December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time , a probe fitted with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the chest .
I &apos;m an optimist .
I usually just continue , &quot; he says .
frankly , I hadn &apos;t worried so many at all .
but Rachel , my wife , was concerned .
the result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year : &quot; you told me that it was mesothelioma . &quot;
Graham Abbott : diagnosis Mesotheliom
suddenly , Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses , one of whom advised him to take a lawyer .
only now does he mean the scale of the epidemic .
&quot; it turned out that asbestos was very widespread , especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos , &quot; he says .
the people exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now contracting .
and so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions .
the most dangerous pipes with asphyxiation in hospitals were beneath the earth , so patients probably were not exposed to the substance .
but many employees who switched from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels ( such as Andrew Lawson ) or in underground canteens ( as Graham Abbott often did ) came in contact with the toxic substances .
it turns out that over several decades after the war , hospitals may have been life @-@ saving for patients , but life @-@ threatening for treatment doctors .
it will still be removed today .
students placed their bunk burgers on asbestos mats .
and it doesn &apos;t just affect hospitals .
asbestos has often been used in offices , shops , libraries and city halls because of its fabulous insulating and flammable properties .
schools too .
in fact , many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
across the country , in thousands of chemical dogs , students have put their bunch burgers on asbestos mats .
the issue of asbestos in schools is now frequently raised on websites .
and meanwhile , such innocent items have included asbestos in our homes as floor plates or wheelchairs by default .
&quot; it &apos;s an industrial product that is contained in large parts of our properties , &quot; notes Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy &apos;s Hospital .
in one case , the only contact that occurred to a affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s .
so adjust how to tear down your garden shed .
the effects of diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
&quot; it takes a while to process that , &quot; says Graham Abbott .
I went back to work and tried to continue , but I realised I couldn &apos;t focus on what I was doing .
I was in practice for two weeks .
then I knew I had to go and take care of myself .
well , I won &apos;t see another Christmas .
with the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from a doctor &apos;s position to that of a patient .
like countless patients before him , he recalls how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with .
&quot; it was very hard to absorb all of this , &quot; he says .
&quot; I asked my doctor &quot; how long do I still have ? &quot;
and you gave me about 12 months .
I remember thinking , &quot; Well , I &apos;m not going to experience another Christmas .
it was then . &quot;
mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life @-@ saving mechanism - breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer .
most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact .
asbestos consists of smallest fibres .
if the asbestos are woven up and the fibres are inhaled , they can be found in the chest , the skin around the lungs .
asbestos fibres irritate the chest and can trigger cell mutations .
&quot; the problem arises with the inhaled needle @-@ shaped asbestos fibres , &quot; according to Professor Tom Treasure , a heart Thorax doctor who moved to Guy &apos;s Hospital in 2001 .
exactly the hospital from which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed him to asbestos is now ironically , a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma .
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others , who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital .
once asbestos needles reach lung tissue , Treasure says , &quot; they are pressed from breathing to the edge where the skin is .
it is invasive from the very beginning .
the usual options for other cancers don &apos;t work so well at Mesotheliom .
for example , the effectiveness of an operation is hotly disputed .
some think she &apos;s worth a try .
Treasure denied that .
&quot; you can &apos;t cut off the chest , &quot; he says .
they don &apos;t get around with the knife .
meanwhile , the cancer &quot; does not speak very well on chemotherapy , &quot; which shows &quot; effect &quot; but does not heal .
&quot; sometimes there are long @-@ term survivors , &quot; Treasure says .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis .
two and a half years after his own diagnosis , Graham Abbott is still fighting .
after he contacted Mesotheliom , Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson , who had become a one @-@ man support and consulting firm for co @-@ workers four years after his diagnosis .
&quot; hello , cancer center , &quot; he happily presented himself in calls .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; Abbott says .
he had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
initially , Abbott was offered six chemotherapy cycles , which would last four months and would likely extend his life by just one month .
&quot; I was desperate , &quot; he says .
I wanted to give up .
Lawson , however , &quot; managed to make things appear in a slightly more positive light . &quot;
after consulting several doctors , Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang @-@ Lazdunski , heart Thorax specialist at Guy &apos;s .
&quot; we had an advantage by not having to go further , I just called and got an appointment , &quot; Graham admits .
a normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the authorisation of treatment .
money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to perform the best available therapies .
but if these treatments inevitably fail , many people face another financial worry - about the future of the families they leave behind .
and so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
&quot; it has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health , &quot; says Morgan .
but what changed in the 1960s was that one realized that a very low burden also posed a health risk .
and here business negligence began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy &apos;s Hospital eventually settled their case , but it was not what Morgan called a &quot; full @-@ fledged compensation , &quot; since Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy &apos;s .
however , following the investigation into his death , a spokesman for the Guy &apos;s confirmed that &quot; asbestos fibres were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s . &quot;
that was too late for Andrew Lawson .
how asbestos can be removed
indeed , for Mesotheliom sufferers seeking compensation , it is an enormous problem to assign the fatal asbestos contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents .
many of their previous employers have been sold or closed .
insurance records can be lost .
and those who oppose claims know that the time is for them , but certainly not with the plaintiffs .
in response , there have been clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for Mesotheliom stakeholders to file compensation , even if their former employers are no longer found .
the law has set up a fund of £ 350 million funded by the insurance industry for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 , but cannot sue anyone .
in these cases , plaintiffs receive 80 per cent of what a court could have told them in a normal compensation process - about £ 120,000 .
about 300 successful applications at the program are expected each year .
Andrew Morgan , like so many Mesotheliom stakeholders , thinks that £ 350 million was a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal by insurers for insurers , &quot; he says , suggesting that this amount is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if time hadn &apos;t gone over and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally .
Mike Penning , then @-@ Labor and retirement minister , also admitted that the law was &quot; not perfect . &quot;
but both Penning and Morgan admitted that , given seven deaths daily , rapid action is needed .
&quot; people are suffering so much and need help today , &quot; Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December last year .
at that time , Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang @-@ Lazdunski for 19 months .
after their first deliberations , Lang @-@ Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect , unlike Tom Treasure .
this was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang @-@ Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years .
Abbott felt stronger .
&quot; this is obviously with the most important thing , &quot; Abbott says .
this is always seen in patients .
there is something that lets you continue .
when you give up , you get worse very quickly .
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012 .
in late August , he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him .
post @-@ sorgescans showed no signs of the disease .
then I had a scan in March 2014 .
there were several cancer spots around my chest .
I was just 50 .
this is not life @-@ threatening .
this is life @-@ changing .
again , Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles .
now no trace of the tumors is visible .
but the process is physically and mentally very exhausting .
you have to think of practical things - about the money if I &apos;m no longer , for example , or my wife showing how Boilertime works .
if you get bad news , you &apos;ll be negative .
you have to look forward .
as the father of Ellie , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; for parents , that &apos;s hard , &quot; he says .
it &apos;s hard to know what to say and how much .
when I received my first diagnosis , I told my girl that I had a disease with which I wouldn &apos;t be old .
they responded very differently .
Tamsin is very sociable and unscrewed .
she told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls .
Ellie was more restrained .
she didn &apos;t say much .
such conversations are something all cancer patients need to go through .
but for mesothelioma sufferers , such talks are not rampant of hope , not of a trail of hope for survival .
the disease brings a grim safety ( just as it is laughable for Stephen Jay Gould ) .
as Andrew Morgan says , &quot; Mesotheliom is not life @-@ threatening .

China denies Hong Kong right to rule , protesters swear retaliation
on Sunday , despite the increased calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate .
that approach probably fueled the long @-@ announced protests in Hong Kong &apos;s business district , while activists launched planning and mobilization within hours of the announcement .
the Chinese People &apos;s Congress &apos;s decision basically allows Communist leaders to reject all non @-@ peking candidates .
&quot; this is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , &quot; said legal expert Emily Lau , chairman of the Democratic Party .
that &apos;s not what Beijing had promised .
the inhabitants of Hong Kong have been blamed .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
in his defense of the Chinese decision , Li Fei , vice @-@ general secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People &apos;s Congress , said that allowing public nominations in the elections would be too &quot; chaotic . &quot;
since 1997 , when Britain gave back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese , Beijing has promised to allow residents to choose the government seat from 2017 .
China &apos;s leaders presented Sunday &apos;s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong &apos;s citizens a direct electoral right , but the decision also makes it clear that China &apos;s leaders remain firmly in hand with a nominating committee closely controlled by Beijing .
a new clause also allows only candidates &quot; with love for the country and love for Hong Kong . &quot;
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most publicized protests took place in Hong Kong for several years .
behind the pro @-@ democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement , whose organizers have threatened to cut off the financial district if Beijing does not allow real general suffrage .
on Sunday night , within hours of the announcement , hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain ahead of Hong Kong &apos;s government headquarters .
at the demonstration , organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civilian disobedience and planned them protest waves in the coming weeks .
however , they did not elaborate on this , apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , organizers announced that the movement &quot; considered the occupation of the Central District only as a last resort , an action to be taken only if all the dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice .
we are sorry to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and that the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place .
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing &apos;s announcement for days , and it balked at tightening security measures including police forces and barricades on Sunday in front of the government building .
the unrest is amplified by the sense of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the access of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services .
there is also a growing fear that Hong Kong &apos;s values like democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under Beijing &apos;s growing pressure .
some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement as it threatens business operations - Hong Kong &apos;s lifeline .
&quot; the protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage , depending on how many are involved and how long they are stopping , &quot; said legal expert Regine Ip , who has long criticized the movement .
we do not want to raise fears that Hong Kong is out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
China &apos;s state @-@ controlled media also recently reported on democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers .
this summer , activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights , involving 780,000 people - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong .
in July , tens of thousands participated in one of the largest pro @-@ democracy demonstrations in the region &apos;s history .
the tradition of school graduation balls in the US is now transferred to universities where Freshmen &apos;s performances are offered with the private plane .
we look forward to responding to this demand and offering Britain &apos;s first luxury travel service to students today .
to make a particularly impressive appearance at university , the company also offers transportation options such as private aircraft , Rolls @-@ Royce Phantom , Aston Marten or McLaren P1 .
Mr Stewart also admitted that the service had a safety saving .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to cut their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car across the country .
together with our new VIF options , we look forward to making sure this year students reach university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury .
a company spokesman said no new bookings had yet been made since the service had just been introduced , but added that &quot; students would book the service in the next few weeks . &quot;
the company also announced that despite tuition fees of £ 9,000 a year , it expects a market for this offer .
students today differ greatly from students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it &apos;s more important than ever to make a great first impression , and with VIF you can do just that .
however , the National Student Union criticized the service as canceled .
Megan Dunn , vice president of the NUS for higher education , said : &quot; this offer seems completely separate from the lives of most students .
many students who start studying this month face a crisis of living costs , as available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep pace with the sharply rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something like arrival in the student home .
feminists criticize racial issue and police behaviour after Ferguson
the unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson , Mo.
participants raised their hands in the air and sang , &quot; hands high , not shooting &quot; while waiting before the funeral .
after two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo . , because of the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown , the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists .
according to their experience , white feminist commentators put gender before the race when it comes to raising reproductive rights and income inequality .
however , while tensions in the Midwest rose and received attention across the country , Perez saw that white women &apos;s responses turned 100 % around the race .
compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shots of August 9 , personal essays with titles such as &quot; thoughts on Ferguson from a white woman &quot; and &quot; feminism isn &apos;t just about suppressing women &quot; relatively late .
but for Perez , that meant an important change .
&quot; I don &apos;t think you find in feminism a lot of people who are talking about white and privileges in such a high @-@ class way , &quot; she said .
people felt urged to express something about the incidents .
it is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnized that they must express it .
for English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University , Ferguson brought problems to light to which black Americans are exposed every day , but who are not considered a &quot; women &apos;s beating &quot; in cultural space .
&quot; I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere , &quot; Mitchell said .
if I post something about how Farmer is under siege in her own country , silence is deafening .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in public space ? &quot; she asked .
for black women like Mitchell , who have studied race , gender and sexuality in U.S. history , there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems .
for them , black women have not had the luxury of separating the issues neatly ; they live in combined reality every day .
while white women now combine the themes of race and gender in feminist mainstream circles , Angela Hattery , professor of women and gender research at George Mason University , says their predecessors were doing the opposite .
&quot; between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were yelled and the rationale was almost always the rape of a white woman , &quot; Hattery said .
white women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching .
for Hattery , the split between white and black women came at the point where white combatants for women &apos;s voting rights such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and determined that the fight for voting rights could only be successful for one group : women or blacks .
&quot; they made the decision to stand up for women &apos;s vote , and the right to vote for blacks should come later , &quot; Hattery said .
recalling such things , one realises with power why coloured women don &apos;t trust white women .
we didn &apos;t do our job well .
we never helped black women protect their husbands and sons .
even after women were given the right to vote in 1920 , it lasted a decade before white women organized themselves against the lynch in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching .
the group emerged nearly 40 years after the original request for help from pages of black women , Mitchell says .
for Mitchell , the tide of white feminist reactions to questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior , racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played &quot; fliers &quot; with the problems that black women have faced for generations .
&quot; wouldn &apos;t it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms approach a child &apos;s right to education as seriously as they do with the right to contraception ? &quot; asked Mitchell .
second @-@ generation feminists who built up their careers on the battle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means are now trying to understand what that means .
well @-@ known white feminist activist Gloria Steiner went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and released a pointy article from Rebecca Carroll , columnist of the Guardian , in which she calls for more protests from white Americans on racism .
&quot; I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent to the body - and opinions on race that are significantly different in public polls - will cite the changes , &quot; Steiner wrote .
although Steiner stands for a more intersectional feminism in which racial and gender issues are addressed , some of her comments on the racial issue in America are stunned .
Christina Sommers , a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of &quot; Who Stole Feminism ? &quot; said to She The People that young men in the United States , especially young coloured men , are &quot; far more vulnerable than their sisters , &quot; but Steinem &apos;s remarks to Ferguson are contrary to their previous criticism .
there are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
but when the White House recently launched a small program , My Brother &apos;s Keeper , to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men , there were annoying reactions from many feminists , including Gloria Steiner .
the relationship between police and the black community is not the only problem pushing into the forefront of mainstream feminism .
after the U.S. border police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country &apos;s southwest border this year , the issue of immigration reform is also returning to the surface - this time as a women &apos;s theme .
Andrea Mercado , co @-@ chair of We Belong Together , an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform , said that for a reconsideration of the issue as a key women &apos;s theme , they simply had to publish the stories of immigrant women .
&quot; these speak for themselves , &quot; Mercado said .
when the vast majority of working visas go to male immigrants , the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; these stories find an afterthought in the women &apos;s organizations , &quot; she said .
&apos;pig house &apos; in Ipswich stands for sale
the image of a home for sale was removed from real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig it had been comfortable in the living room .
the detached house has a bedroom , is on a private road in Ipswich and is being offered for £ 120,000 .
among the details was a picture of the house &apos;s living room - which included a pig that had begged his head on a sofa .
real estate agent Connells said the pig on the photo was the owner &apos;s pet .
&quot; the photo , however , was mistakenly published and has since been removed , &quot; a spokeswoman for the company said .
in the exposé of the house , Connells described the former assembly building as a &quot; unique single @-@ family home with a bedroom . &quot;
although the broker has removed the image from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
home sales caused interest in the social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price .
the SW town of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after lottery win
a lottery player from Harvey is up this month
the search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues , with a happy winner receiving nearly $ 1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday .
a newspaper kiosk in Harvey drew the jackpot in the draw of the first division for the second time in five years , after $ 1 million in November 2009 .
the happy winner , however , has yet to report .
shopkeeper Steve Forward said the profit provided talk fuel in the small town in the southwest of Perth .
the city is talking about nothing else , and everyone is pretty excited .
we thought such a profit could occur .
eight WA winners celebrated gains in the first division last month , a due deal for a few happy weeks for players in the state .
last week , a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a married couple from Belmont scored the megawatt of $ 7.5 million just a few weeks earlier .
the winning couple had played for twenty years and said the win allowed them the possibility of a world tour and buying a new house .
the millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in WA this year , with a total of nearly $ 85 million .
Leonidas asked for gladiator arena
not only were the gladiators standing ankle deep in the match at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the leisure park .
but the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1,000 visitors yesterday , who defected to the razors and the herbaceous cold and were fully enthusiastic about the historical spectacle .
there was a colourful stream of depictions , performances , games , exhibition pieces and information about the time of the Romans and their importance to the Rhineland .
the main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Martian fighter group from the gladiator school &quot; Amor Mortis , &quot; which used every rainy break to demonstrate its robust martial arts in the arena with soft sand .
gladiator owner &quot; Leonidas &quot; turned out to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter , sending his men into the ring to heroic two @-@ fight in various gladiator attacks .
first , the &quot; Provocators &quot; were on the line with rectangular and short sword , as well as leg rails on the left leg and wrists on the right arm .
it followed the &quot; Essedarii &quot; with breast shield , short sword and root and iron glazing helmet , leg and arm protection .
it was particularly impressive that the &quot; RETIARIUS , &quot; which came up against the &quot; SECUTOR &quot; with a sausage net , triple bag and dagger .
there , the swords metallically clashed , the shields sprouted and the sausages flew surging through the arena that could become a fear and bange around the health of the gladiators .
but to whom had the imposing &quot; Summa Rudis , &quot; the muscular referee , an ever @-@ attentive eye .
&quot; we wanted to revive Roman everyday life and experience the culture of Roman times , &quot; explained Lorenz Euskirchen , Chairman of the Römerkane circle , the intention behind the spectacle .
after two years of preparation time , an &quot; Oppidum Romanum , &quot; a Roman city , was identified in his greeting word from the leisure park for one day .
after all , the Romans have brought not only war and conquest in our region , but also Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today .
remains of this were also to be marveled at Roman Day , such as &quot; Aquädukt @-@ Marmor &quot; from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman canal bridge , which was once at Lüftelberg .
the Frontinus company once and now faced water and energy supply , and managing director Petra Fricke knew : &quot; we are still benefiting from the knowledge of then . &quot;
this also confirms diploma surveyor Ralph Heiliger from Rheinbach , who presented surveyors of the Romans such as Chorobat , Groma or Dioptra .
the Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations anno 1894 , as well as brickstones from the original hypocrites , the wardrobe that once heated the Roman villa .
also impressively the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay before burned them .
in 2011 , the Land Monument Care Office at the Rheinland National Association excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the commercial park Nord in Rheinbach .
it was found to have covered walls of an economic building with a bowl for drying cereals and for painting .
the building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica , an agricultural estate , explained archaeologist Dr Jennifer Morscheiser .
a number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass vitrine , including a large plate , several fine glass vessels as well as parts of a delicate necklace .
the villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century to Christ until the invasions of the Germanies in the then Roman Rhineland , Morscheiser suspects .
in addition , the children dealt with the Roman windmill game similar to today &apos;s Mühlespiel , or they wrote like the Roman students their names with metal lines on wrists .
the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves at the booth of the Römerthermen Zülpich , basteln at the stand of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach Glasmosaiken , and at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim Natural Centre , use a heavy wheat mill made of stone to grind the flour for a fladenbrot or mule .
the original Roman travel car , built by two cold blossoms , drove visitors through the leisure park , passing by the impressive state of the town of Gymnasium , which presented the results of its &quot; Römer Projects Week . &quot;
with a Roman week from 13 to 21 September , the municipality of Wachtberg will also be involved in the Rhone Country Year 2014 , which is to be remembered for the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago .
together with the home and history associations , as well as the Wachtberger Wander @-@ Association , the Partnership Association and the Oberbachem Laidlaw , thematic walks , a lecture , cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and remember the Roman past of Wachtberg .
for example , a Roman Legionaire is told of his work on the aspiring Wachtberg , presenting plants as living monuments from the Roman era and presenting a witty lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberger &quot; Germanen &quot; and assigned Romans .
the Adendorfer Elementary School is dedicated to the Roman theme within a project week .
with the RömerWeek , the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg , which are often no longer visible at first sight , are to be experienced again .
at Wachtberg City Hall , a small presentation will be remembered at the Fund of Berkumer Matronenheiligie in 1879 .
Ebola : the epidemic strains West Africa &apos;s economy
the Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
markets are orphaned - and international companies are at a distance .
the devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to West Africa &apos;s economy .
the harvest rotates in the fields , the mines are left and the markets are wasting - the virus has been hard on the region .
some international companies are already at a distance .
&quot; the Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic one , &quot; the head of the African Development Bank , Donald Kaberuka , ruled .
Liberia is hardest hit
&quot; it &apos;s a total disaster , we &apos;re losing a lot of money , &quot; says Alhaji Bamogo , who sells clothes in the second @-@ largest market in Liberia &apos;s capital , Monrovia .
on the market comes just who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola .
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus , where more than 600 people fell victim to the fever alone .
recently , health officials said the disease had penetrated at every angle of the country .
the virus has also spread in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria .
in total , more than 1500 people have died , and thousands more have died .
foreign firms pull employees off
companies throughout the resource @-@ rich countries suspend their operations .
foreign companies such as the Arcelor Mittal steel company withdraw their employees , several international airlines no longer fly the affected regions .
local traders and farmers are also reacting : few merchants are still leaving their homes in order to recover .
in some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia , which are under quarantine , among other things , the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export in the fields .
farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest .
food is scarce
&quot; people are going to travel less and less , &quot; says Phillipe De Vreyer , Paris expert on the economy of West Africa .
the man , for example , who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables , prefers to stay at home .
the population therefore receives the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently : food is scarce .
in the markets , the stockpile of staple foods such as rice is dwindling .
at the same time , the region heavily dependent on international firms is threatening to have an image , with far @-@ reaching consequences .
the biggest danger is that international firms are generally long @-@ running the area , says Philippe Hugon of French think tank Iris .
what is crucial is how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors may feel that it is dangerous to live and thus invest in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia , &quot; Mr Hugon warns .
the disease also charges states &apos; strained state budgets
the disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the states concerned .
the ratings agency Moody &apos;s is concerned that its budgets are heavily strained by high spending on the health system and in addition by the deteriorating economy .
the African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with $ 60 million ( $ 45 million ) .
the effects are also noticeable in Nigeria , where so far few Ebola cases have been diagnosed .
although the oil @-@ rich region in southern Nigerdelta has not yet been affected .
but elsewhere , many people already remain at home for fear of contagion .
reservations in hotels also go back significantly .
protect celebrate her 50th anniversary
the Beetle Association &quot; Tannenwald &quot; Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September .
at the Tannenwald Schützenverein , preparations for the 50 @-@ year foundation festival run from 12 to 14 September .
scheduled is on Friday , September 12 , a big entertainment evening with the group &quot; Dorfrocker . &quot;
Saturday is the big villain shooting at 6pm .
then in the big marquee of the mood evening with the Stoapfalzer Spitzbuam .
bladder capsules for music
highlights on Sunday are the festival service and 9.30pm in the parish church and the grand festival at 2pm .
in the afternoon , the price distribution of the federal and Gaußens is also .
a particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festivities with their Dirndln .
Festkapelle is the blowband Berngau .
patronage has taken over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker .
the original name &quot; trench company Tannenwald Berngau &quot; dates back to 1907 , when the association was founded on 21 March for &quot; social entertainment through exercise in room and small caliber shooting . &quot;
the NS regime led the dissolution of the association in 1937 .
only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves again , who lifted Berngau from baptism on April 30 at the Lukas inn .
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a protector through a difficult initial period in which it was mainly about finding a club location and installing the shooting operation .
as early as autumn 1965 , the Schützenverein started in the &quot; Leininger &quot; inn with two teams in the runner @-@ up competitions .
in the following years , sports protection , which have now been organized in seven teams , established itself in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga .
the association records purged each year and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached by Rudi Meier for the first time in 1980 .
as the performance of the active shooter has increased , membership numbers have also developed positively .
after the &quot; Leininger &quot; association was no longer satisfied with the demands of a modern trench association , then @-@ CEO Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the basement rooms of the new &quot; Landgasthof Härteis . &quot;
after a work performance of 2700 hours , on 8 May 1988 parish Strasser issued the church blessing for the new trenches .
one of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gaushoot , combined with the solemn wicket of the new trench in July 1991 .
on 23 and 24 April 1994 , the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary .
a Böllergroup was founded in 1995 .
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent .
a major challenge for the &quot; villagers &quot; and for the club as a whole was the focus of the Bavarian villain meeting in 2005 .
in many hours of volunteer work , last year &apos;s club members modernized the rooms and the shooting facility in the Berngauer Hof , bringing them up to date .
eleven teams in runner @-@ up
you can also see the sporting services of the trench association .
in total , 11 teams are currently taking part in the runner @-@ up matches : six Air Force teams , an air @-@ gun team , a sports gun KK1 , a youth and two AH teams .
the 1st team with Lars Ellrich , Katharina Ellrich , Steffi grad and Kerstin Kellermann has risen to the District League 1 in the 2013 / 14 round by the GautopLeague ( highest league in the trendiest ANB ) .
the second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier , Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from Gauleague North to the Gauupper league .
in addition to the shooting sport , events such as Bockstechen , Faschings- and Königsball , club excursions and Christmas celebrations have a tradition .
the trenches are also at the festivals in parish and community .
Tony Stewart suffers accident in return to race track
Tony Stewart &apos;s return to the circuit ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway .
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst into round 172 and finished his evening .
Stewart drove his damaged car to the garage and left it without talking to journalists .
his team chief Chad Johnston said his 14 @-@ man team was disappointed but is now focusing on next weekend &apos;s race in Richmond , Virginia .
&quot; I wish we had a better bet and a better result for him , &quot; Johnston said .
we go to Richmond and hope we can do better there .
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in the race Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to repair the right side of his car .
&quot; I came up with fairly good hopes of a good result today , &quot; Johnston said , adding : &quot; it just didn &apos;t work out . &quot;
not long after the second accident , Stewart &apos;s car was loaded into the lock and the team had packed and was ready to leave .
Stewart allowed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver in an ashore race in the north of the state of New York .
he decided to return this week and either win in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in pursuit .
he returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20 @-@ year @-@ old Kevin Ward Jr. , who entered the runway during a race to confront Stewart .
authorities announced Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will last at least two weeks .
no decision has yet been made on whether Stewart has to face a charge .
the three @-@ time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race .
after a start to 12th position , Stewart was early in the first 10 and was temporarily ranked fourth .
after a restart in Round 122 , Buschs
cars with No. 18 out of control after the exit from Kurve 2 and collided with Stewart , with both cars drove against the wall .
Stewart continued but fell back to No. 21 .
dance joyous offspring sought
just try out : Laura , Lena , Lisa , Marie , Bettina , Emma and leader Lisa Neitzel ( from left ) are looking forward to joining forces .
like many other clubs , the jazz groups in the TV annual of the full @-@ day classes at the secondary schools will be created .
after the summer holidays , some groups have been severely decimated .
now more young people are looking for a sport that is healthy and fun .
in the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel , formerly a dancer in jazz and modern dance formation &quot; Spirits , &quot; only nine children are still .
&quot; three in the group of eight @-@ year @-@ olds , six in the group of 12 @-@ 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old tells me .
with more activists , the whole thing would be much more fun , &quot; you could dance very different choreography , &quot; she says .
if you want to dance , Thursday between 17 and 18 o &apos;clock or on Fridays between 17 and 18 : 30 in the dance room at the former Hotel Meyer , Freistraße 9 , you can enter the training hour without obligation .
&quot; training starts regularly with a warm @-@ up program , &quot; the trainer tells me .
different choreographs are then carried out .
jazz dance has the characteristic that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles .
elements from folklore , classics , sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance .
of course , the conviviality is not too short .
&quot; we &apos;re also going to eat , watch dance films and we &apos;ve already overdone in the dance room , &quot; Lisa Neitzel reports .
in the group you can close friendships , share a wonderful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development .
if you don &apos;t like jazz dance , you can also add in one of the other TV anniversaries .
children and young people can always take part in the lessons of children &apos;s dance / jazz dance , bambini ballet , video clip dancing and hip @-@ hop .
the dance coach is Francisco Afonso .
adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday .
if you like Discofox , Langsam Walzer , Viennese Walzer , Rumba , Cha @-@ Cha @-@ Cha and Tango , you can go by and take part .
Bulgarian prison supervisors protest nationwide
hundreds of prison workers from across Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest before the Justice Department in the capital Sofia .
in the peaceful demonstration , they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions , which were recently changed .
higher salaries are also on a forum list to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov .
officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and are calling for a return to the former 24 @-@ hour shifts .
despite the meetings between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Justice Department , no agreement was reached , the Bulgarian National Ratio ( BNR ) reported .
negotiations are ongoing , the Director @-@ General , Rosen Zhelyazkov , told BNR .
the protest by prison workers is expected to be supported by members of the union of interior ministry employees .
Ukrainian army has abandoned airport of Luhansk
in eastern Ukraine , pro @-@ Russian fighters continue to march .
after heavy fighting , in which Russian tank battalions were reportedly involved , the Ukrainian army abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk today , Monday .
the army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours .
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel from his army &apos;s heavy defeats in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without giving details .
pro @-@ Russian separatists shot down plane
in the fight against Ukrainian government forces , pro @-@ Russian separatists have again shot down a fighter plane and two military helicopters , according to their own portrayal .
about 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region , according to the insurgents on Monday .
coastal Guard ships sinking
the insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats from the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Asov Sea .
Ukraine &apos;s border guard confirmed that two of its ships were under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol .
seven border guards were injured , a spokesman in Kiev told broadcaster 112.ua.
two crew members behaved as missing .
local media blamed Russia for the incident .
the separatists also reported having brought several localities under their control in the Donetsk area .
diplomatic offensive in Minsk
in the Belarus capital , Minsk , the Ukraine Contact Group is meeting today .
in addition to representatives of Ukraine , Russia and the OSCE , a commander of separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate .
in advance , all actors used their appearances to publicly announce their request .
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia by the planned deployment in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis .
NATO Secretary @-@ General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday in Brussels that NATO is sticking to the founding agreement of the 1997 NATO @-@ Russia Council .
the NATO chief , however , accused Russia of &quot; a stark breach &quot; of the agreement .
&quot; today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner , &quot; Rasmussen said .
documents and opinions from the Russian side indicate &quot; that they view us as adversaries . &quot;
stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he wants to strengthen NATO &apos;s presence in Eastern Europe .
a &quot; Readiness Action Plan &quot; to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that &quot; we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is needed , &quot; Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday .
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed to new talks to resolve their gas dispute .
negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday , Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak said Monday .
it is still waiting for a decision by the European Union whether it will also send a representative to the talks .
because of the dispute over the price of gas , Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks .
most recently , EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger conveyed between the two sides .
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supplies for Europe .
Europe accounts for about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources , much of which flows through Ukraine .
Merkel talks power word : toll will come &apos; quite clear &apos;
now the Chancellor is clearly committed to it again .
however , it is not a free letter for all the complicated details .
persistent concerns from the CDU against the passenger toll have gripped the CSU again .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a power word for introducing a car toll after continuing opposition from her CDU .
&quot; to make it quite clear : she is in the coalition agreement , and she will come , &quot; the party leader said Monday after meetings of the CDU &apos;s top bodies in Berlin .
however , Merkel was not firm on a detailed model for the time being .
in the black @-@ red government program , &quot; certain parameters &quot; are called .
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) &quot; made a proposal , and this is now continuing to work . &quot;
however , the NRW CDU insists on its No to a toll equal on all roads .
Merkel stressed that Treasury Secretary Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) is also preparing constructively for a bill .
beyond the issue , he also talked with Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure , such as broadband .
&quot; there &apos;s nothing special about it , &quot; Schäuble said Sunday , adding a &quot; Spiegel &quot; report uncommented , saying his house is considering a separate approach to remunerating highway investors with toll revenue - after the 2017 election .
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the Cabinet .
CDU Federal Vice President Armin Laschet reiterated his objections .
&quot; the Coalition contract never went on to maul all the district and federal roads , &quot; the North Rhine @-@ Westphalian CDU president said .
in this respect , it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will discuss the issue again .
opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU National Associations of Baden @-@ Württemberg and Rheinland @-@ Pfalz .
there are fears that a toll will affect small border traffic with neighbouring countries .
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty because of the toll criticism from ranks of the CDU .
the left sees the plans as failing in the face of the dispute in the Union .
&quot; the Murks toll is dead , &quot; said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the New Osnabrück newspaper ( Monday ) .
&quot; with the toll , the minister fails , &quot; Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignetting duty on all German roads to launch in 2016 .
however , domestic car owners may not be charged additional under the Coalition Agreement .
they should therefore receive full compensation for tolls through the car tax .
however , under EU law , the model must not penalise foreign drivers because of their nationality .
genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
a Britin says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she would die .
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease .
she actually suffered from the Charcot @-@ Marie @-@ Tooth disease ( CMT ) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord .
charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnosis is a frequent problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease .
about 23,000 people in Britain probably suffer from CMT , which can lead to motor disruptions such as muscle weakness , an uncertain gear and cracked toes .
the disease is incurable and progressing , which means that symptoms get worse with time .
when Rodgers was 13 , she believed she was suffering from Friedreich @-@ Ataxie ( FA ) - a disease with very poor chances of survival .
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she &apos;d 18 , and die before her 30th birthday .
the mother of two children , now 51 years old , said : &quot; as a child I knew I couldn &apos;t do the same as the others .
I fell constantly and everything lasted longer with me .
I could never ride with the other children wheelchair or skateboard and was often hired in school because of my way and running .
Rodgers said she looked at her medical records at the age of 13 after several operations to relieve her Achilles and stretching her feet when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA .
&quot; I felt guilty because I had been curious , so I didn &apos;t tell anyone , but I went home , searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society , &quot; she said .
when I received an answer , I was shocked and terribly panicked .
I thought I &apos;d be in a wheelchair with 18 and die with 25 , and in between slowly losing all my skills .
I did all this alone with me and planned my own funeral .
she said when she became 17 , she became clear that her skills had not diminished as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor .
he just stood up , and hugged me and said , &quot; My love , I don &apos;t think you have that , otherwise you &apos;re already warming up in a wheelchair now . &quot;
I think you have a little less life @-@ threatening .
after some genetic tests , her CMT was found .
&quot; when he explained to me what CMT was like I felt like I was a winner , &quot; she said .
charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Award @-@ winning month to draw attention to this disease .
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a firefighter since the closure of the former troop exercise
for just over ten years , no more has been scored on the former troop training board in Munich .
despite this , toddler ammunition occurs every month at the heart of the Swiss biosphere area .
the grenades are sometimes still so dangerous that they need to be blown up locally .
a deafening bang echoes at the explosions over the heart of the biosphere area .
in December 2004 , the last sharp shot fell on Munich &apos;s troop training board , which closed in late 2005 after 110 years of military operation .
since then , the 6500 @-@ acre area has been the core of the Swabian Alb biosphere area , which is open on 13 designated routes for hikers and cyclists .
tax burden on businessmen in Washington area rises with economic recovery
a recovery in the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
government and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year , while the economic recovery accelerated , according to a newly published study last week , and firms in the Washington area formed no exception .
companies in the Area District , Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $ 27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the 2013 financial year , an increase of 3.8 percent compared with 2012 revenue of $ 26.6 billion .
the company &apos;s government and local tax burden rose 4.3 per cent to $ 671 billion last year , compared to 3.9 per cent the year before , and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of falling modesty in 2009 and 2010 .
government taxes rose more than local levies , up 4.3 percent , according to the study conducted by the services agency Ernst &amp; Young with the Center for State Taxation , a tax policy group .
more than half of the District &apos;s tax revenue , 56 percent , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of Marylands &apos;s revenue comes from businesses .
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 percent .
much of the increase in tax revenues is grounded in a recovery in the company &apos;s property values , researchers say , leading to an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent .
while much of these gains came from large states such as California , New York and Texas , the course also seems to be reaching for the Washington area .
companies in the District , Maryland and Virginia jointly paid more than $ 10 billion to state and local real estate agents last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over a year .
but the apparent recovery in property values is not as effective in Maryland in raising government and local tax revenues , as property taxes here amount to just over a fifth of companies &apos; tax bills .
companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
&quot; in Maryland , a large part of the real estate , especially in the tax area around D.C. , is either owned by the government or by non @-@ profit organizations that don &apos;t pay property taxes , &quot; said Douglas Lindholm , managing director of the Center on State Taxation .
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes , for example , to provide the same services that other states offer .
the recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
company revenues also appear to be recovering , according to the data .
companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $ 2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the region &apos;s highest amount .
while the trend is heading in the same direction , the local tax burden on businesses does not rise evenly in all three places .
the entry rate in the District was 4.3 percent of the national average , while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher , 4.9 percent .
only Virginia reported below @-@ average tax revenue of 4.1 percent .
Virginia , with 6 percent in all three jurisdictions , has significantly the lowest corporate income tax rate ( in all three , there are fixed corporate tax rates ) .
Maryland &apos;s corporate tax rate is 8.25 percent and in the District at relatively high 9.975 percent .
a similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that fewer state and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and overall there is a better tax rate than in Maryland .
the study did not examine the District .
despite the benefits , Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor .
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent , the same rate as Virginia , and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year .
if the state continues to meet its income targets next year , this law could reduce the state &apos;s corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017 .
meanwhile , small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better , and they therefore pay more state and local taxes , according to the latest study .
corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure under which most small businesses are organized - in the District , Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $ 2.4 billion , a marked faster rate of growth than corporate taxes overall .
researchers say the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year , with an increase in overall multi @-@ party tax revenue for the state and local governments rising 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year .
still , the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government &apos;s spending cuts affect the region &apos;s labor market .
twin city : German beer for Guangzhou
hops and malz - also a popular combination in China .
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China .
Frankfurt &apos;s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes to have a direct flight connection between the two cities .
German beer , used in Frankfurt &apos;s twin town of Guangzhou , is the urgent desire of officials in China .
&quot; we would be very pleased if a German brewery were to settle in our city , &quot; the vice party secretary of the South China metropolis , Li Yiwei , said this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city .
over and over again , the official of China &apos;s ruling Communist Party came back to this concern of the twelve @-@ million metropolis .
Guangzhou , which is also called canton in Germany , is one of China &apos;s richest cities , warb Li .
as a result , people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer .
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer @-@ Gümbel , who led the German political delegation , told the host he will be interrogating in Germany after a possible partner for the project .
&quot; for beer , it doesn &apos;t take much : good water , grain and joy of life , &quot; he added at lunch with the party &apos;s top in Guangzhou .
that joke already radiates Mr. Li , he flattened the host .
then the official from Guangzhou met with Schäfer @-@ Gümbel - but with red wine served at the dinner .
the Chinese brand Tsingtao dates back to German brewing .
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity offer .
more business
a second wish by the Chinese hosts would be a flight direct link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou , vice @-@ leader Li said .
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons .
&quot; it would be worthwhile again , &quot; the local politician was convinced .
&quot; business activity between our two cities continues to grow . &quot;
currently , travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan province , Li complained .
the administration of Guangdong province , whose capital , Guangzhou , is also hoping for the flight link .
the province &apos;s vice governor , Chen Yunxian , placed that desire at the forefront of his conversation with the Social Democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea , &quot; Mr. Schäfer @-@ Gümbel - the Chinese vice @-@ minister , Li Jinjun , an intimate connoisseur of Germany , answered .
neat partnership
Guangzhou &apos;s leftist vice @-@ leader hopes he can visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year .
Li Yiwei was already on the Main but not yet in this function .
he only came into office this year after his predecessor was promoted from office for corruption charges .
local leader Wan Qinglian also had to go .
the crackdown on officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration enforced with harshness by leader Xi Jinping .
new leader Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party &apos;s career , which is highly unusual in China &apos;s Communist Party .
prior to his inauguration in Guangzhou , he worked as a top official in Fujian , where the Volkswagen automaker built a large plant .
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen town partnerships .
the link to the 9,000 @-@ kilometer Guangzhou is one of those maintained by both sides , such as a student exchange .
last year the 25th anniversary of the German @-@ Chinese connection was celebrated .
the southern Chinese metropolis on the Perlriver is almost as strong as its economic power .
next year it wanted to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros , Li reported .
family of Joan Rivers &apos; pushes the thumbs &apos;
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her submission to a hospital in New York City three days ago ; however , her daughter was hopeful today that the 81 @-@ year @-@ old comedian is recovering from her illness .
&quot; thank you for your ongoing love and support , &quot; Melissa Rivers said in a note today .
we &apos;re all pushing the thumbs .
her mother was reportedly hospitalized Thursday after an emergency due to cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side , Yorkville Endoscopy .
doctors deliberately seeded them and under close surveillance until they are more satisfied with their condition , which continues to be described as &quot; serious . &quot;
the reactions came from many sides , including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump , Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa .
environmentally friendly vacuum cleaner and rising wages
in future , stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that come into trade from today .
similar to refrigerators and washing machines , new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1 on which the buyer can detect central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance .
for new cars , the &quot; Euro 6 &quot; pollutant class applies more stringent nitrogen oxide levels .
there is also more money for scaffolding workers : they receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of € 10.25 .
Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
Amazon just confirmed what information had reported Monday morning : the online retailer - and video maker , and a variety of other things - is buying the video streamlining service Twitch for $ 1.04 billion ( $ 970 million ) .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch , but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company .
three months ago , it looked as though the sale of Twitch to Google &apos;s video service was decided for a cool billion , and the collaboration also seemed natural .
twitch , founded only three years ago as Justin.tv , was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bragging pieces in games , a &quot; YouTube for live games , &quot; according to an insider .
the Twitch interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play , &quot; a video genre in which better the ( mostly older ) games give a hint of secrecy theaters , are already very popular on YouTube .
it &apos;s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch , so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was somewhat bored , a textbook example of an established technology company buying up a potential competitor .
it &apos;s a mystery of why the deal with YouTube didn &apos;t come about , as the company reportedly agreed to pay as much as Amazon .
all we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear , president of Twitch : &quot; we chose Amazon because they believe in our community , they share our values and long @-@ term visions and they want to help us get there faster . &quot;
another secret is , frankly , the incredible success of Twitch .
for Snobs like me , who explain that they prefer sport rather than watching it , it is hard to understand the attraction that emanates from watching others while playing , rather than taking the control console into their own hands .
it &apos;s one thing to look at a friend at 3 a.m. over the shoulder while she &apos;s snapped by resident Evil , and something completely different , to watch a spinner as he is shot 20 times in Call of Duty in the head .
you could just watch all these games now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games are now ego games , so the addition without its own control over the eye perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches .
I admit that the quick runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age complete games are entertaining .
but until a game or humor virtuoso is involved , his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do skeptics like me know about it ?
twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic tips .
and how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it ?
it &apos;s hard to imagine Twitch being so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could easily have swallowed .
but Twitch has something every company would like to see : thousands of young men encircled as advertisers .
as the chairman of Twitch , Shear said , Amazon and Twitch &quot; believe both in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium shows no signs of contraction , not even - sip - as spectator sport .
there was a lot going on the hill at Burggarten Festival on Saturday .
the concept of organisers agreed .
despite the strong rain on Saturday night , an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open @-@ air festival in Burggarten .
at times , the deposit had to be stopped .
&quot; it was annoying , &quot; said Ron Sem , one of the organizers .
Salzwedel l light and fun .
from two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula .
for the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is to broadcast brightness on the day and evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes from alone anyway .
that showed up early Saturday as the first visitors turned up to open air .
a festival for all generations had promised organizers .
and they did .
Salzwedeler , as well as guests from the nearby and other surrounding area , had made it comfortable .
they watched the first live appearances , wiped with the foot in the clock , enjoyed cool drinks - short : relaxation pure and enjoyment were said .
and that across generations .
while the one was lying on blankets on the extra @-@ carved white sand at the beach bar , others were working on a quarter of wine in the vinothek , the offspring raged on the hillside , which was a big attraction for the smaller guests .
but even with the children &apos;s smash , the volunteers , in the true sense of the word , had all the hands to do in order to become the gentleman and conjure imaginative creations into the small faces .
the larger ones took advantage of the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop organised by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel .
until the big rain came .
shortly before 5.30pm he preached to the visitors , especially families seeking the pasture and dry .
but the attraction of the festival did not do so .
&quot; there were more people than expected , &quot; said Ron Sem , who spoke of a &quot; success on the whole line . &quot;
that is why there is nothing to do with a repeat of the big party next year .
although work still needs to be done on the content and size of the event , Sem made clear in an initial assessment on Sunday of the popular vote .
he described as annoying that in the meantime the admission had to be stopped .
obviously the security company had been booked with too few powers .
as a result , some who had already paid no more came to the site .
the resonance was very good .
in a first cautious estimate , the Salzwedeler co @-@ organiser spoke of about 1,200 visitors tumbling in the Burggarten .
there were problems with sound technology .
the Salzwedeler hip @-@ hop band Blocks &apos;n &apos; Rox broke their appearance .
the technicians were unable to create a half @-@ wise sound .
the planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tyre .
&quot; next year , however , they will be there , &quot; according to the organiser .
the premiere of the Amula Open airliner was more than accomplished by visitor numbers .
and that in bad weather .
however , the organisers made some mistakes that will be pulled out at the first time , but will have to be eliminated at the second edition .
even on social network Facebook , organisers must criticise .
&quot; sorry , but for 12 euros you just expected more , &quot; Melanie Meier commented on the event page .
&quot; you have unfortunately taken over a little bit , &quot; says Ele Zimmermann in the same place .
others don &apos;t see the initial problems quite as tight .
I think it is very good that some are not only stupid but also really trying to put something on their feet .
hat off ! &quot; writes Stephanie Jenß to Amula .
now organisers have a year to resolve these criticisms .
new Radom in Berkum : Wachtberg &apos;s landmark shrinks
it is not expected .
rather , the prepared part is waiting to be used in the distinctive construction .
the action is in the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the development of the TIRA space observation radar , the shell , known as Radom , is completely renewed .
the new wheel will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 metres than the old one .
size , however , still remains world record .
the final step to complete the new shell is the cascade exchange
the upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane .
after that , the last quarter of the new shell is set up .
if the weather is playing , the action is to go on stage at the start of this week .
participant in Ice Bucket Challenge rebounds Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Britain shouted so much when her ice @-@ cold water was poured over her head that she violated her face &apos;s bone structure .
this Ice Bucket Challenge went painfully next .
a woman was hospitalized after being so shouted at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she was retiring the jaw .
Isabelle Roberts from Britain circled so much when her ice @-@ cold water was poured over her head that she violated her facial structure .
&quot; the water was so cold that I cried , and while I was doing the act , my jaw was just standing , &quot; she said to The Mirror .
ice water is shaken over the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth , but that didn &apos;t go , the jaw was haunted , and then I understood that something was wrong .
my mother and my sister saw this , too , and made up for laughter almost in the pants , but I had to go into the emergency .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old from Britain was hospitalized to return to the jaw after attending the viral trend on Tuesday .
the clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter .
are the Burgundy clubs coming back to a stop ?
last but not least , there have been pressures between the two Wolfratshauser Burgundy clubs .
now the boards are thinking about possible cooperation .
as an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle , the late Richard Dimbath , former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgundy , introduced the project in the French Guédelon .
a year ago , there was no good climate between the castle club and the castle friends Wolfratshausen .
so far , positions on how to deal with the history of Wolfratshauser Castle and possible reconstruction seemed very different .
now the two camps are moving together : talks on a common approach are to be held soon .
this is confirmed by Torsten Sjöberg ( Burgverein ) and Herbert Piffl ( Burgfreunde ) on demand from our newspaper .
&quot; I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down once , &quot; Sjöberg reported .
in his view , all members of both clubs would be able to pull back in the future .
this is how we can see more quickly .
while the Burgundy mountains around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had to face a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest , the Burgverein around Sjöberg is at the forefront of the &quot; development and experience &quot; of the terrain .
Herbert Piffl , co @-@ chair of Burgundy , was very pleased about the call according to his own details .
since Dimbaath &apos;s death , he has faced Burgundy .
a new chairman is due to be found in a member meeting in mid @-@ September .
currently , according to the 74 @-@ year @-@ old , the club counts around 40 members .
&quot; after the death of my friend Richard Dimbath , we first left the association activities out of respect , &quot; which was necessary to &quot; consider how it could proceed . &quot;
according to Piffl , the new chairman should then go into the conversation with the Burgverein .
by then , the Burgundy dogs could also make a recent sentiment within their grouping .
there is currently no candidate for the presidency , Piffl says .
&quot; but I &apos;m confident someone will find himself , &quot; he himself doesn &apos;t want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz .
the new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser .
the Tölzer would like to work on the project &quot; but very much . &quot;
the different positions on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future .
he appreciates Dimbath as a &quot; missionary &quot; who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar projects already advanced in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock .
they are a tourist magnet thanks to the high participation of the population and volunteers from around the world .
Piffl : &quot; even I was skeptical at the beginning .
but over time I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to advance the project . &quot;
there is nothing else here .
in addition , the project could be financed by EU grants , visitor tickets and potential sponsors , Piffl believes .
&quot; the idea of rebuilding , I personally don &apos;t want to just throw over board , &quot; he hopes that the Burgverein may be moving on to that point .
their goal of documenting history first &quot; is important and good . &quot;
after that , you could see .
clever ways to save at university textbooks
since the cost of university textbooks is more than $ 1,000 a year for many students , the fast @-@ two @-@ year @-@ old student Matt Schroeder took over a clever savings idea .
he invented a surrogate system for books by students of higher semester and offered nominal compensation to delay the resale .
&quot; my math book usually costs $ 180 , but I got it for $ 10 for a semester and a Chick @-@ fil @-@ A @-@ Kek , &quot; said Schroeder , 19 , who attends Covenant College in Georgia .
the books needed for the last semester would have cost him $ 430 , he said .
he spent $ 120 .
the college newspaper announced that , on average , students spend more than $ 1,200 a year on textbooks and study material , but that there are different cost @-@ fighting options for students .
online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students .
hiring textbooks is becoming more popular , and students can use a book for a semester , often at a much cheaper price than when buying .
Neebo Inc , which operates more than 250 university bookstores , announced that rents of text books have doubled since 2011 .
surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in college bookstores last spring , Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said .
less than half of all textbooks are bought in campus bookstores , according to the Commerce Association of College Stores .
here &apos;s the one @-@ off for the best deals .
buy online
some new books cost online only one @-@ third of the price for which they are in campus bookstore .
the ninth edition of &quot; Calculus &quot; vno Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $ 290 , but can be obtained from the specialist textbook retailer Chegg.com for $ 239.99 .
buy needed
if one of the notes of other or normal utility tracks does not make up , used books are a good option .
&quot; calculus &quot; is needed on Chegg.com for $ 93.49 .
Matt Casaday , 25 , graduate student at Brigham Young University , says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of &quot; Strategic Media Decisions : understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business . &quot;
the book was resold for $ 48 .
academics such as Ingrid Bracey , head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls , advised students to ask at their professors whether previous expenses were permissible .
sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant .
in such cases , older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue .
apart from Chegg and Amazon , Half.com of eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to used books .
rent
the rent of textbooks is worth a thought if you treat them reasonably well , remember to return them and you don &apos;t want to keep the books after completion of the course .
they can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book .
for example , a student could rent &quot; Calculus &quot; for about $ 20 for the duration of a semester .
find out about the terms of the business in which you rent , including the criminal charges that may apply to the writing of notes , undercuts or utility tracks .
tenants beware : if you don &apos;t return the book , the criminal charges may even exceed the price of a new book .
e @-@ Books
e @-@ books rather than traditional textbooks are also an option .
sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com , Chegg and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc .
at Chegg , you can rent &quot; Calculus &quot; for 6 months for about $ 61 .
Bracey says students in literary courses often find the best deals , since many classics can be downloaded for free nowadays , while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive .
look around anyway .
Joe Gault , 29 , who will soon attend Pepperdine Law School , recommends the ISBN number for pricing on books , as you can be so sure to find the right textbook .
and before an online order , you should check , so Gault , if the book is actually preliminary .
he learned that lesson on the hard tour .
he bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookshop .
why &quot; Guardians of the Galaxy &quot; didn &apos;t become a cashier
&quot; the Expendables 3 &quot; by Sylvester Stallone played down less than $ 30 million of its $ 90 million budget in the US , while &quot; Sin City : a Dame to Kill For &quot; played just $ 12 million of its $ 70 million budget .
the film , &quot; Sex Tape , &quot; which is tailored to Cameron Diaz , played just $ 14.6 million on the opening weekend , while children &apos;s films such as &quot; Dragons easily made 2 &quot; also disappoint in revenue .
an article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children &apos;s films the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason .
Collin described 2014 as &quot; the worst year &quot; so far for children &apos;s films and described &quot; dragons easily made 2 &quot; as a purely &quot; functional &quot; fantasy sequel .
for films for a slightly older target group , however , it seems as if the quality of films is not necessarily the problem .
in July , Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Metacritic rating for each summer movie launch , which was shown between American Memorial Day and July 20 , 2013 and in the current year to at least 2,000 canvases .
the results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and suggest that this year &apos;s film hits are equivalent to those of last year .
some commentators think the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix .
Director Jon Favreau , who is currently working on Disappeared &apos;s soon @-@ to @-@ be jungle book film , told the Web site Hollywood Reporter : &quot; I think times are changing . &quot;
we must accept this and not try to follow the past .
in contrast to the current weak cash results of Hollywood productions , Netflix recently posted sales of streaming content of $ 1.2 billion , nearly double last year , in which sales totaled $ 837 million .
last summer , the director , Steven Spielberg , criticized the film studios for focusing too much on filming comics and predicted a &quot; meltdown &quot; of Hollywood .
in the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his grim prophecy may well contain a true core .
however , other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic because of the potential cashier to be expected in the summer of 2015 , including Avengers : age of Ultron , Minions and Jurassic World :
the producer of X @-@ Men , Simon Kinberg , described the drop in cash results recently as simply &quot; cyclical &quot; and told Hollywood reporters : &quot; next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema cup ever , and no one will worry about the business anymore . &quot;
when the 2nd Table Tennis District class was scrapped a few years ago to streamline the league division , this has been a step in the right direction .
now Deutsche Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the programme .
as a result , those who have not risen have gone down .
so Divinity &apos;s class @-@ tallest team , Torpedo , has avoided the descent in the league release , but plays only fifth in the coming season .
fourth @-@ ranked Torpedos ladies , despite their terrific passing into the regional league .
the boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League , as well as the boys of SC chanting .
the SG Lenglers and the Torpedo Reserve are joining the new Verbandsliga , in which the National League is no longer represented .
at the ladies , TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga , the Torpedo second in the National League .
what from the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district head league South .
here are TSV Seulingen , VfB Lödingsen , Torpedo III , Geismar , Einbeck , Hammenstedt , Bovender SV , Langenholtensen , FC Weser and TTC .
in the district league , the regional representatives of Dransfeld and the SC Weende play , in the district class of TTC II , Red White , the Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III .
Güntersen , TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the game .
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen start in the district league .
with nine teams each
the SC Weende sends his girls to the small county league .
even the county league season of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete .
in a district class , Geismar , Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV enter the season .
in the first season of the newly founded Regional Association , the two goddesses start with nine teams each .
in the West season are Red White II , Bovender SV III , Laubach II , Torpedo IV and V , MTV Grone , Dransfelder SC II , Mielenhausen and SG Lengler II .
Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen , Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the Eastern season .
the Ladies League consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II , Bilshausen , Hemeln , Seulingen II , Tuspo Weende and SG rhume .
that &apos;s still better than in the district of Osterode , where there are no women &apos;s teams at county level .
what is striking is that none of the six ski classes reaches sollstrength , here the innovative and revered district board will have to consider .
NATO summit : first protests in Newport and Cardiff

a search of local police and emergency services broke down and the couple were found around 11pm near the Bridal Veil waterfalls .
the girl had been injured at the knee and the man was toppled and had his head beaten up .
rescuers stayed at the couple overnight and they were flown out on Monday morning .
they were delivered to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance .
anti @-@ government protests in Pakistan escalate
the roughly 1,000 protesters were pushed by soldiers from the PTV building , Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said .
the station resumed broadcasting after just half an hour .
PTV director Athar Farooq said protesters armed with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial .
deaths or injuries were not reported .
the protesters are calling for the leader &apos;s resignation , whom they accuse of electoral fraud .
police said that about a kilometre from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , clashes of some 3,000 protesters with security forces were again on Monday .
according to hospital records , a policeman was injured .
at least three people were killed and more than 500 wounded at the weekend as protesters tried to penetrate Sharif &apos;s residence .
they are calling for the Prime Minister &apos;s resignation .
the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict on Sunday night after a meeting at the Army headquarters , &quot; without wasting time and using it without force . &quot;
the Communication also stated : &quot; the army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state . &quot;
escalating violence has raised concerns about military intervention , which has already leapt more frequently in the past .
protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since Independence Day on August 14 .
Sharif refuses to resign .
Khan and Qadri called their supporters on Sunday to stand out .
&quot; we will not go back without having forced Sharif to resign , &quot; Khan said .
Qadri spoke similarly .
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election in May last year by fraud .
Qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments .
then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call for new elections .
more than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district .
the protesters initially held out peacefully in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them at the weekend to penetrate Sharif &apos;s residence .
Hütteldorfer after two seasons on three of the table .
with the 2 @-@ 0 over Gardena , for Rapid , a bitter week on Sunday has taken a conciliatory end .
&quot; the win is very liberating , &quot; said coach Zoran Barisic , whose team had reached a stopover with the draw in the Europa League on Thursday .
&quot; the success experience was scary important , &quot; confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann , who finished with green white at three .
Schrammel &apos;s dream gate brings Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid has shown the right reaction to disappointment against Helsinki with the second season and goes into the country game break with a success experience .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive reaction , &quot; said outfielder Thomas Schrammel , who , with his magnificent leadership volley of the sixteenth in the 14th minute , put the wicket on victory .
&quot; I thought I was going all the frustration of Thursday and sniffing him under the latte , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old said smiling .
when Schrammel met for the last time in a federal league on Nov. 13 , 2010 , it was still for Ried .
the first championship match in the Rapid @-@ Dress will therefore remain in special memory .
&quot; for me this is something very special , I &apos;m from the rapid @-@ offspring , &quot; Schrammel said .
due to Mario Pavelic &apos;s short @-@ term pool blessur , Schrammel backfired from the left to the right defensive side and did his thing very well there too .
he has enough experience that he can also exercise that position .
the goal he earned , he &apos;s already done some assists this year , &quot; praised Barisic .
team show character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2 @-@ 0 by Hofmann after well over an hour that finally brought the decision .
the staff were very friendly and helpful .
&quot; thank God we were lucky today , &quot; also noted Schrammel , who contributed to the breakup of performance and result in recent weeks : &quot; the results did not vote , but the playful was always good compared to last year . &quot;
Barisic even found that &quot; in many games you had been better than today &quot; - against &quot; the strongest team that played at this stadium this season . &quot;
the first three @-@ point lead since 26 July therefore proved that the man @-@ of @-@ the @-@ match was intact to the setbacks : &quot; today my team showed that it has character . &quot;
for him not minder pleasing : &quot; that we finally played too zero again . &quot;
a lot of work during a country break , including the fact that with Brian Behrendt , Mario Pavelic , Christopher Dibon , Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger , several failures are to be lamented , and Srdjan Grahovac , Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made the victory even more valuable .
&quot; you must not forget that , &quot; Barisic , who lost with Behrendt and Pavelic players over the past three days , &quot; who have been very stable lately . &quot;
the country play @-@ off should therefore be used to &quot; lure wounds and add a bit to the body , &quot; said Barisic , who has five U21 selectors in his ranks .
one that seems to be particularly close to the break is Captain Hofmann .
he smashes for the team , goes over pain .
especially at this difficult stage , he showed that he is a very important player for us , &quot; countered Barisic .
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his draw in the 68 minute not only the structure but also scored the second goal .
for the 33 @-@ year @-@ old , who completed his 35th Bundesliga game , it was the first hit from the game since November 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 over the Admira ) .
Hofmann : &quot; may not believe that now everything is good &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve certainly had a bit of luck too , but at some point luck must come back to us too .
now it was high time , &quot; Hofmann said .
however , he cautioned for more focused work : &quot; you must not always see that black and white .
we haven &apos;t played as badly in recent weeks as this has been portrayed .
however , we must not believe that everything is good now .
he could not deny the importance of his role for the team .
it is a very young team that I can help very much at the moment .
they stick to me in certain phases , &quot; Hofmann said .
Val Coach Michael Baur had little to blame for himself and his team .
he regretted the quick opposition &quot; from the Wizard category , &quot; as well as Nutz &apos;s regular goal in the 40th minute , which had been wrongly recognized by referee Colleges .
the only accusation I can make to the team is that we weren &apos;t specific enough towards goal in some phases .
we have had too few qualifications .
interior defender Maximilian Karner looked similar : &quot; it started equally badly , but then we found it purely and even made a goal .
broadly speaking , more would have been in it .

we showed a powerful tribe at our puzzling task of the summer series &quot; My piece of Rhöner luck &quot; last Friday .
several of these tree giants still exist in the county , the depicted specimen is the &quot; scourge &quot; above underground fountain .
a rough footpath leads up to the roughly 600 @-@ year @-@ old oak .
it goes past chalets , basalt stone clusters and basalt stone seas .
a piece below the stone wall from Bauersberg , a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach , there it stands .
Vital sees the natural monument , it rages beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and remembers an American mammoth tree with a range of over eight metres .
a small Buddha on a tree stump suggests it is a spiritual or mystical place .
however , despite intensive research , there was only evidence of the name .
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bischofsheimer Archives and interviewed older people from Lower Weißenbrunn to find out what practical features it has with the scourge .
the outcome of his investigation remained the fairly sober explanation for the name .
thus , until about 80 years ago , goat hunters were said to have ripped their animals from underground fountain to the painstakingly roasted and driven by stones .
at the foot of the tree , the animal keepers exhausted from the rise are said to have rested .
in the meantime , the area has regained its meaning , because on the meadows , goat herds are in fact still soft .
the area has also been declared the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve , Schneider has further found .
when entering the stone collections , however , we should be careful , because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place to stay for Crusaders .
a hiking path leads from Unterweißbrunn to the tree , but it is a little hidden .
there are other ways to get up and down the direction of Hochrhön and invite you to a long walk .
where is the watercastle ?
however , a watercastle that is sought at our next task is rather rare to find .

after weeks of tumbling , Italy &apos;s prime minister and acting EU chairman , Matteo Renzi , has pushed against strong conservative opposition at the EU special summit last week to win the nomination of his Secretary of State Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy , you will succeed Britin Catherine Ashton .
Renzi considers how the government @-@ run daily La Repubblica restates the appeal of his Mogherini , which is also a favorite in the government team , to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU .
he also expects a boost to his &quot; reform package &quot; in Italy .
last but not least , Renzi hopes to calm down the left @-@ wing party base that he has repeatedly sought , because Mogherini is assigned - albeit more moderately - to this .
to the Conservative representatives with Commission President Jean @-@ Claude Juncker and Poland , nominated as President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Donald Tusk , the dominant opinion in Rome , is to achieve political balance .
after all , the EU &apos;s chief diplomat will also become Deputy President Juncker .
the pending approval of the European Parliament is considered certain .
otherwise , President Giorgio Napolitano would have called the nomination of the 41year @-@ old politician of the ruling Democratic Party ( PD ) hardly an &quot; important recognition &quot; of Italy &apos;s role in the EU .
la Repubblica spreads optimism that the Mogherini , which has been proven for almost two decades in leading party offices and is known for its ambition , will rise to the &quot; enormous challenges . &quot;
the native Roman is married and has two daughters .
her party career began the doctorate in 1996 in the youth organisation of the then Democratici di Sinistra ( left @-@ wing democrat ) , which joined forces with the Catholic Centre party Margherita to present @-@ day social democratic PD in 2008 .
in 1999 , Mogherini became Vice @-@ President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth ( European Young Socialists ) for three years .
with the 2001 election to the left @-@ wing Democratic Party , she rose to high party politics , working in the Foreign Policy Department , whose leader soon became her .
it has identified traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy , such as the Middle East , as well as studies of NATO deployment in Afghanistan involving Italy with a troop contingent , used contacts with social democrats in Europe and with US Democrats .
she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2008 , where she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs .
when Renzi became prime minister in February 2014 , he regretted Mogherini becoming his foreign minister .
once again , if the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country , which contributed to the party &apos;s more than 40 per cent vote in the EU elections in May , Federica Mogherini will have a share of it .
the representations made in Brussels , the new EU external representatives have too little diplomatic experience , in other words lack substance , are countered in the PD .
in Brussels , particularly by Poland and the Baltic members , Mogherini &apos;s profoundly realistic accents of the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and defamed as a &quot; country @-@ friendly course . &quot;
it supports the South Stream pipeline , which is operated by Russian firm Gazprom , through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe , which also serves Italy &apos;s energy security .
after Renzi took office as EU chairman in July , Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first state visit .
photos they showed with Putin at Shake hands were taken with indignation in Brussels , as well as that they invited the Kremlin leader to a Milan economic summit for October .
a total of nine young people started their training at EMZ @-@ Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday .
among them is an Azubi who has previously completed a different training in the company .
in the future , the new staff will be active in four training missions : electrons ( three trainees ) , mechatroniker ( two ) , tool mechanics ( two ) and process mechanics ( two ) .
all Azubis come from the county of Schwandorf : Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach , Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden , Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald , Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach , Daniel sorgenfree and Sebastian Zahner from Pfred .
the new trainees attended primary and secondary schools and secondary schools .
from Wednesday to Friday , the trainees of all seasons , as well as the instructors , will take part in a team training event to Oberammergau , where , among other things , a full day hike and rafting are on the programme .
the company has 435 employees in Germany and 950 worldwide .
the number of trainees over all seasons is 27 .
the Socialists in France should &quot; keep their mouths and put France in order , &quot; said Francois Hollande &apos;s main ally .
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show &quot; their love &quot; for the controversial socialist president , whose cabinet reshuffle has stoked disapproval among the vast majority of the French .
the President deserves every respect , he deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
&quot; it &apos;s our duty to stay at his side , &quot; he said at great applause .
as a descriptive gesture , the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35 @-@ hour week in France despite fierce calls for an easing of regulation by Emmanuel Macrons , the new economic minister .
on Saturday , Mr. Hollande urged his fellow socialists to show &quot; united &quot; with the government .
but Christiane Taubira , the Justice Secretary , stretched sand into the gear in which she stepped up at a meeting of breakaway Socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French &quot; faith in their future . &quot;
marine Le Pen , the far @-@ right leader of the National Front , mocked the Socialists &apos; constant engraving struggles and said she could not imagine the new Valls government going through for longer than a few months .
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes , but Prince Manuel Valls also has none , they are forced to form a new government if the old one did not survive a summer .
&quot; and the new will also not survive the fall or winter , &quot; Fräulein Le Pen said to supporters .
she reiterated her party &apos;s call for a dissolution to parliament and said she was confident of winning in early elections and was ready to run for government .
France &apos;s ruling party suffered defeat in the March local elections and the right @-@ wing National Front was ahead in May &apos;s EU elections .
a poll in Sunday &apos;s Journal du Dimanche showed that 76 per cent of French people believe the Socialist Party is exposed to the danger of falling apart in several rival groups before the end of Hollande &apos;s term in 2017 .
Pascal Perrineau , a political scientist at Sciences Po University , warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new Socialist government did not improve the economy and record unemployment .
&quot; there is a small window for opportunities , but public opinion has to feel quickly that things are changing , &quot; he warned .
otherwise , the situation could deteriorate further .
Norwegian Cruise just ahead of a deal with Prestige Cruises of $ 3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O , the world &apos;s third @-@ largest cruise operator , is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire rival Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $ 3 billion , according to industry experts .
a deal would give Norwegian Cruise , a company with a market value of $ 6.8 billion , access to Prestige Cruises &apos; luxury cruise ships as well as its wealthy clientele , while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd ( RCL.N ) and Carnival Corp ( CCL.N ) .
an agreement could be announced earlier this week , the sources said Sunday , and warned that the talks could also end without results .
the owner of Prestige Cruises , the private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC ( APO.N ) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise .
the sources asked to remain anonymous as negotiations were not public .
representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment , while a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment .
Norwegian Cruise , a Miami @-@ based company , operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America , the Mediterranean , the Baltic Sea , Central America and the Caribbean .
its revenue was $ 2.57 billion in 2013 , a 13 percent increase compared to 2012 .
Prestige Cruises , also based in Miami , operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent , which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia , Russia , the Mediterranean , North America , Asia , Africa and South America .
it reported revenue for 2013 of $ 1.2 billion , an increase of 6 percent compared with the previous year .
the cruise industry as a whole is about $ 29 billion and in the next few years it is expected to grow because of the strengthening of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India .
the companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise operators for these new customers .
Prestige Cruises requested the IPO of US regulators in January 2014 .
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company for a $ 850 million deal in 2007 .
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise carrier owned by Genting Bhd ( GENT.KL ) , a leisure and casino group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay .
Apollo invested $ 1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008 .
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock market in January 2013 .
Genting held 28 percent of the stake in late June , according to approval ratings , Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity firm TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company .
Carnival , Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise share more than 82 percent of passenger capacity on American cruise ships , according to the original order documents for Prestige Cruises .
pro @-@ Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision .
a pekingtreue group waved near the Chinese flag .
the permanent committee of the National People &apos;s Congress passed a framework law on Sunday allowing only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017 .
all candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nominating committee , which is expected to be filled with peking members .
this decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote , prompting pro @-@ democracy activists to make up their threat and paralyze Hong Kong &apos;s financial square with Occupy Central protests .
political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong ; and China &apos;s party leadership fears that calls for democracy will spread to other cities .
after the publication of a Beijing White Paper outlining China &apos;s dominance of Hong Kong in June , democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region , where hundreds of thousands marched in the city &apos;s business district and organized a sit @-@ in there .
Lis questioning is organised by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong .
the Deputy Chairman of the Legal Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee , Zhang Rongshun , as well as the Deputy Director of the Office of Hong Kong and Macaus of the State Council , Feng Wei , should be consulted during the day .
student activists vowed to gather in front of the chief executive &apos;s office in Hong Kong in the afternoon .
Britain did not envisage any democratic elements until the end of the 150 @-@ year colonial government in Hong Kong .
Putin asks Kiev to begin &quot; statehood talks &quot; with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government suspend fighting against separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the &quot; statehood &quot; of the breakaway region .
his spokesman , Dimitri Peskov , later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area of eastern Ukraine , under the control of the separatists , will become part of Russia , but that its status with Ukraine needs to be redefined in order to give the Russian @-@ speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests .
Putin &apos;s call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with pro @-@ Russian insurgents , however , fits in with the strategy he appears to have pursued since the start of the riots five months ago : help the separatists to seize territory and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija de facto independence with Russia .
in an interview with state @-@ run television channel Eins , Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reclaim the territories held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk , which were taken in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18 .
the Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the captured area &quot; Novorossija &quot; or &quot; Neurussland , &quot; a term reminiscent of the pre @-@ revolutionary glamour of the Russian empire .
Putin pointed out that all those who , in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Oct. and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists , are hoping for early peace talks &quot; caught in their illusions , &quot; Itar @-@ Tass reported .
&quot; we need to start detailed talks immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organization of society and the state status of South @-@ Eastern Ukraine , to preserve the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
Peskov said Putin &apos;s reference to statehood in the context of greater autonomy , which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to allay fears in Russian @-@ speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk .
only the Ukrainian government can provide the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas , Peskov said .
this is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , Peskov said , &quot; because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but about an internal conflict in Ukraine . &quot;
the Kremlin &apos;s clarification on the correction of Putin &apos;s remarks &quot; misinterpretation &quot; underlined Russia &apos;s leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east , unlike the direct annexation of Crimea , on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine , as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the period before the conflict gave a broad majority to stay in Ukraine .
the autonomy raised by Russian diplomats at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations , and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over an area linking the Russian territory with Crimea .
the peninsula annexed to the Black Sea five months ago is the home port for most of the Russian navy , as well as a major commercial and historical coastal region .
the regions between the Rostowland region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines , factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military .
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko , in his speech on inauguration on 7 June , suggested that Ukrainian legislation , after new elections , should consider additions to the constitution giving greater control to the respective territories over their finances and the status of languages .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and separatist rebels whose arming and incitement Moscow is accused of .
Putin &apos;s latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders on an equal footing followed a further push by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Asov Sea .
Russia @-@ backed separatists took control of Nowoasowsk , according to fears Ukrainian security officials are the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea .
for this reason , massive civilian and military preparations have been under way to consolidate Mariupol , a steel industry with 500,000 inhabitants , located between Nowoasowsk and narrow access to Crimea Peninsula .
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic who has been independent for 23 years .
&quot; we are on the verge of a point where there is no going back , &quot; Poroshenko warned .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukraine &apos;s territory .
the EU summit decided not to take concrete action , and the leadership called for further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank fighters and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists , Colonel Andrij Lysenko , spokesman for Ukraine &apos;s National Security and Defence Council , said Saturday in Kiev .
the first likely 63 Ukrainian soldiers included by the Russian incursion into Ilowajsk were replaced on Sunday against 10 Russian parachute hunters who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago , Lysenko said Sunday .
Nacktphotoscandal involving Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey gems made no secret of his anger over hackers who probably stole naked pictures of his fiancee Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of A @-@ celebrities from Hollywood .
the film town is in agony after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal involving celebrities on the Internet .
the hacker responsible probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence , star from &quot; the Tribute of Panem &quot; and superstars , including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne , the singer Rihanna , Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and the actress Kirsten Dunst .
from Australian actresses Teresa Palmer , Emily Browning , Yvonne Strahovski , and Grecko from Melbourne were reportedly also publishing private photos because of an icloud gap .
there are 101 celebrities on the list .
edelsten , who had loaned with Grecko last month , said to Confidential : &quot; it &apos;s disgusting . &quot;
all private letters and pictures should remain private .
it is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others .
Grecko , currently in New York , reportedly told a news website that the hack was &quot; shameful &quot; and that those affected &quot; felt hurt . &quot;
the hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex @-@ boyfriend Scott Speedman , including two shots in which she is upstairs without in a pool .
Palmers &apos; film works include &quot; Love is invincible &quot; with Liam Hemsworth .
Palmer , Chuck star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comment on the chopped pictures yesterday .
a representative Lawrence &apos; told TMZ : &quot; it &apos;s a heinous violation of privacy . &quot;
actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet : &quot; chopped images from a cell phone to post is nothing other than selling hehlerware . &quot;
it should not be tolerated from a purely legal point of view .
cyclists , joggers and walkers were on the Great Feldberg yesterday at 8th cycling , supporting the club &quot; Help for Cancer Children . &quot;
the tour , which for one was a goalless one , provided a light workout for the others .
in one , however , everyone agreed : it was fun .
Thomas Studanski is likely to have slept well last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus yesterday drove by bike to Feldberg .
for the good purpose .
he can easily put away the small muscle hangover , especially since he has personally brought a valuable insight into the participation in the 8th cycling on the Great Feldberg in favour of the association &quot; Help for Cancer Children &quot; ( Frankfurt ) .
a great thing .
&quot; I know now that I can - fine ! &quot;
little pauses on the way in the applause curve ?
Nee , if I had stopped , was out ...
like Thomas Studanski , who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler Municipal Parliament , many of the 718 participants tormented mountains yesterday in the early morning and came close to exhaustion but happy on the plateau .
others , on the other hand , found it easier to overcome the well 11 kilometres long stretch between Hohemark and Feldberg .
Norman thieves , for example .
the Green politician from the Kreistag - red dress , red bike - made a little bit of an understatement at the start ( &quot; Jede lots of professionals , there is a goal ! &quot; ) , but then turned to the mountain as a half @-@ professional and went through 45 minutes without breathing .
he , too , has passed the track in a slide , as has Nina Kuhn , press secretary of the city of Oberursel , who had been on the way together with Frank Grüneisen .
for the two triathletes , the &quot; Feldberg @-@ Radeln &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; this is about charity , because we are happy with it - an exit we would have made today anyway , &quot; Kuhn added .
on the way , they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg .
the boy ( 12 ) went down to Oberursel in the morning to tighten up again to the height .
Frankfurt &apos;s Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at 9 a.m. in the morning , &quot; making &quot; the Feldberg two times , then rolling home with fun .
fun also had &quot; Fritttoni . &quot;
for the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosks , cycling tours across the Feldberg are simply included .
he had pinned 40 minutes with his 6.5 @-@ kilo racing wheel .
a crazy event .
for this purpose - I am happy to be there , &quot; said Andreas Balzke .
the well @-@ trained maintainer says of himself that he is an &quot; ambitious race trader . &quot;
he must also be , because he was travelling with the &quot; Fixie bike , &quot; which is also racing bikes , but without circuit ...
the fact that it went up loosely even without a wheel proved not only the 20 hikers who rose over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit , but also a jogger who pulled a car tyre with weights behind a cord .
mountain Guard doctor Professor Volker Lischke , who provided security with his team , equipped with all @-@ wheel @-@ bully and quad , said : &quot; the kid &quot; I from Frankfurt , who trains for a special skating rail , just that he pulls the sledge around himself . &quot;
the 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - were sent to groups on the track in the morning .
the hikers first at 9.30pm .
the first cyclists and runners followed by 10 p.m.
five minutes later , the first mountain bikers set off .
Bent Hansen , chairman of the association &quot; Radeln on the Great Feldberg , &quot; gave the starting commandos and wished the participants a nice outing .
for next year , he hopes to lock the track up to the field mountain to the safety of participants .
