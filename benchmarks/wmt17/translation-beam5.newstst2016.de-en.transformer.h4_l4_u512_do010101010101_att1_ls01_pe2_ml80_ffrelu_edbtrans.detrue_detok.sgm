<seg id="2">The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the meeting will also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.</seg>
<seg id="5">The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Washington criticises Israel's ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Obama-led deal on Iran's nuclear program has further worsened the relationship between the two.</seg>
<seg id="8">In March, at the invitation of Republicans before the U.S. Congress, Netanyahu delivered a controversial speech, partly considered an affront to Obama.</seg>
<seg id="9">The speech was not disagreed with Obama; a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election in Israel at the time.</seg>

<seg id="1">In an emergency call, Professor admits he shot his girlfriend</seg>
<seg id="2">In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told police with a slightly treacherous voice that he shot his girlfriend and that officers would have to come to his house.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still living and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inside the house, officials found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a hand-written note that had been cracked on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," according to the authorities in the letter he signed.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office, according to police.</seg>
<seg id="6">Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took life when police boarded him.</seg>
<seg id="9">A day after the shootings in the university that forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The details released by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.</seg>
<seg id="12">Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he has no history of violence or criminal prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teachers include 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, there were some inclinations to problematic behavior.</seg>
<seg id="16">One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous "as if something was wrong with him."</seg>
<seg id="17">Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamm told him he had to deal with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for an assessment on health grounds, saying he had any health problem.</seg>
<seg id="19">This year, he taught only two online courses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not provide him with a guarantee of an automatic path to an appointment as assistant professor.</seg>
<seg id="21">University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lambs's imagination."</seg>
<seg id="22">These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.</seg>
<seg id="23">After fleeing campus, police later found Lambs lane when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="25">His car was still running in the driveway.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lamb grew up in the area.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 residents and taught geography and pedagogy.</seg>
<seg id="29">He received a doctorate in pedagogy in spring.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of Lambs' longtime girlfriends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.</seg>
<seg id="31">Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when they met through shared friends.</seg>
<seg id="32">She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game.</seg>
<seg id="33">He was the women's swarm at the time.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the girls melted up when he was there, "said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of a marriage.</seg>
<seg id="37">They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, bordering a Bayou in Gautier.</seg>
<seg id="38">Police said the dog was fine.</seg>
<seg id="39">The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">She and her mother were absolutely best friends.</seg>
<seg id="42">O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both joined a summer vintage market three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="44">They later played together one gig or another.</seg>
<seg id="45">O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmonic aspiel before an audience.</seg>
<seg id="48">There was no sign that anything was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Just a happy couple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="50">We were on the cleanup and joked to each other.</seg>
<seg id="51">I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.</seg>
<seg id="52">Schmidt, the dead professor, headed the first-semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was married and had three little children.</seg>
<seg id="54">He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee.</seg>
<seg id="55">At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community attended a candlelight memorial ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="56">Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the memorial service, while the university's "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.</seg>
<seg id="57">The lessons will resume on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We're trying to move our students to return," LaForge said.</seg>
<seg id="59">The crisis is over.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is a day of healing.</seg>
<seg id="61">Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="62">Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.</seg>
<seg id="63">That story was corrected to reflect that police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamm, in his emergency call, called Prentiss his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 polls showing that Donald Trump is serious.</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to brand him as a flop.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others dismissed him as a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some are waiting for a breakdown.</seg>
<seg id="5">But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks at polls down, it hasn't (yet) worked.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump in the double digits, and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate moguls.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it is too early in the parliamentary term.</seg>
<seg id="8">No one claims Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to rising Herman Cain, none of whom won either state in the nominating process.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outsiders like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and begin to flow their dollars to topple him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some current poll results indicating that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump's popularity ratings have turned around 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of 10 Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.</seg>
<seg id="15">By mid-July, it was 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In early August, it was 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="19">And those numbers are holding in early states.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a CNN / ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "thrilled" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "thrilled" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next in terms of enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if Jeb Bush, the establishment's favorite, would become the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="28">A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to Republicans believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same number applies in the nation's first pre-election state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to perform effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn't fit into the White House, according to ABC / Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters get used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">When they set up their casual hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.</seg>
<seg id="34">When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN / ORC poll last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.</seg>
<seg id="35">That's been a change since the time when four out of 10 put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to just 28% for final candidate Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still, a variety of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as plausible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even when Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffuse among more than a dozen other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaped majority support.</seg>
<seg id="42">He added 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, ahead of Marco Rubio 14 points, ahead of Walker's 15 points, before Jeb Bush scored 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.</seg>
<seg id="43">It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate beating him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.</seg>
<seg id="46">A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their minds.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new poll by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters supporting Trump say they have firmly forgiven their votes.</seg>
<seg id="48">Of course, much can happen to change that and no one can really say never to change opinion.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">Yet Trump's strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapist" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been the hub of public discourse in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep crucial Hispano Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage reorientation efforts.</seg>
<seg id="54">But according to Monday's new ABC / Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump seems to be doing it.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration over the government is climbing to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half the support of Republican voters, especially through their outsider status.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC / Post's new Monday poll they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they're also angry at Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">A poll by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unhappy" and 21 percent "politely upset."</seg>

<seg id="1">Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze</seg>
<seg id="2">Two-man goalscorer in Piräus: Bayern star Thomas Müller just has a run.</seg>
<seg id="3">A happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then ran.</seg>
<seg id="4">A sovereign kick-off of the Champions League season.</seg>
<seg id="5">World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in Piräus.</seg>
<seg id="6">The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their kick-off in the Champions League at the Greek record-holder Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to garbage's double pack (52nd / 90th + 2) and Götzes hits (89th) earned with 3: 0 (0: 0).</seg>
<seg id="7">The 12th starter in the series is expected to be the first step toward the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third inning.</seg>
<seg id="8">Muller received amicable support from Olympic goalkeeper Roberto during his 28th match in the Champions League to Bayern's lead, which made one shot of the world champion as a flanker.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We won't underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm promised before the game at Karaiskakis Stadium before 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich kept word.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed a focused and committed performance without gleaming.</seg>
<seg id="11">Piräus had won his recent six home games in the premier class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 2011 Borussia Dortmund (1: 3) stumbled here.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Bayern, in seven Europacup duels with Greek teams undefeated, did not want to be the next victim.</seg>
<seg id="14">They bravely ran, but often too inventive to work in their offensive efforts.</seg>
<seg id="15">The attacks were launched too often by playback on left-arm Douglas Costa, who rarely came through against former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.</seg>
<seg id="16">Müller was more lucky from the right than his flank hit from the right half-field in the left upper toreck.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the 67th minute, the world champion gave up the possible 2-0.</seg>
<seg id="18">The best opportunities in half had Robert Lewandowski.</seg>
<seg id="19">First, when Olympic striker Ideye Brown beat Poland's head ball from the line (26).</seg>
<seg id="20">Then by direct withdrawal, the goalkeeper Roberto parked with the knee (35.)</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Bayern pulled up their usual dominant game, Piräus was able to set needles.</seg>
<seg id="22">On goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, though, was forgiveness.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, when he steered a shot of Ideye over the latte (56).</seg>
<seg id="24">Before Neuer allowed Guardiola to defend a four-stroke lead with David Alaba in the centre alongside Jerome Boateng, who made it good.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the caddie, sat out first.</seg>
<seg id="26">The World Cup hero only gave the go-ahead after finishing training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at Sky: "Whoever wants to make something different from it is already malicious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Even at the first change, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the troubled Lewandowski (59).</seg>
<seg id="28">Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by penalty Müller still put one up.</seg>
<seg id="29">Before the game, riots had occurred at the stadium.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a smaller group of partially mumbled Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the followers of host Piräus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and went with batons against the Munich supporters.</seg>
<seg id="31">At least one Bayern fan was transported injured from the stadium.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth</seg>
<seg id="2">Those who smoke do not only harm the lungs, but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long-term study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The good news: In the event of waiver, the risk drops quickly.</seg>
<seg id="4">Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several staff from the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.</seg>
<seg id="6">Compared to non-smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely was 2.5- to 3.6-ounce higher.</seg>
<seg id="7">Scientists had watched more than 23,300 participants.</seg>
<seg id="8">The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammation of the gum, the DIfE stresses.</seg>
<seg id="9">For these parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.</seg>
<seg id="10">The link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore based on more frequent tooth infections in smokers.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.</seg>
<seg id="12">People who stopped smoking, however, could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers wrote in the Journal of Dental Research.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, it could take more than ten years to return to the level of non-smokers, explained Erstautor Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.</seg>
<seg id="14">One has to convince people to become non-smokers, said University Manager Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."</seg>
<seg id="15">Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health right up to the high age.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 is affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure.</seg>
<seg id="18">The new long-term study underpins the findings.</seg>

<seg id="1">Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP</seg>
<seg id="2">To defuse the dispute over the planned TTIP transatlantic free trade agreement, the European Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.</seg>
<seg id="3">The controversial private arbitration institutions for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which corresponds to far more traditional courts in its functioning.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We want to establish a system that citizens trust," said Cecilia Malmström, EU Commissioner responsible.</seg>
<seg id="5">Swedin intends to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.</seg>
<seg id="6">The German government announced support.</seg>
<seg id="7">TTIP aims to create the world's largest free trade area with 800 million people.</seg>
<seg id="8">The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically provide that the EU countries and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.</seg>
<seg id="9">They will come from the EU, the US and third countries alike.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is also a second instance for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would allow it to appeal against judgments.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed with each other on arbitrators, and there has been no objection to their judgments.</seg>
<seg id="13">Commenting on the debate over the past few months, Commissioner Malmström commented.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the long term, it intends to work on an international investment court, according to its own information.</seg>
<seg id="15">Disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could then be resolved.</seg>
<seg id="16">The investor-state arbitration (ISDS) procedure, which was mainly required by large corporations, is considered one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe to TTIP.</seg>
<seg id="17">Traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, over which companies seek damages at the expense of taxpayers, wipe out national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">First opinions identified anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact as inadequate to the Commission's proposals.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was mainly criticised for not applying the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, German Minister for Economic Affairs Matthias MACHNIG (SPD) described the plans as a major step forward.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Commission takes into account key elements of the reform drawn up by Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel in the spring with other EU Trade Ministers.</seg>
<seg id="22">The old system of private arbitrators is off the table.</seg>
<seg id="23">The French Government also welcomed Malmström's plans.</seg>
<seg id="24">The European Business Association BusinessEurope warned that too many new rules would restrict business appeal.</seg>
<seg id="25">Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be penalised.</seg>
<seg id="26">When talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) FTA can be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="27">Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US.</seg>
<seg id="29">Initially, a framework for the agreement should be in place at the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="30">This date is considered no longer sustainable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg</seg>
<seg id="2">Eleven years ago Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now: Luxor).</seg>
<seg id="3">Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with a film pen.</seg>
<seg id="4">The entire audience, about 40 people, is nearly taken by Stevens talk.</seg>
<seg id="5">He tells from various places he keeps recording on the map, which his minutiae and tender arranged songs report.</seg>
<seg id="6">Where they were born and what it looks like there, in his home.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderfully creative Irishman.</seg>
<seg id="8">With the album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State," published in 2003 and the third album, "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State," sounds cleverly composed songs that are harmoniously very close to American folk of the late 1960s, but can drift into great opulence at any time.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is a rumor that "Michigan" would be the first part of a weathered series: Each of the 50 US states should be kept in succession.</seg>
<seg id="10">But "Seven Swans" has already appeared in 2004 and in Rhineland.</seg>
<seg id="11">Stevens is reduced here.</seg>
<seg id="12">Live meets him guitar and banjo.</seg>
<seg id="13">A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.</seg>
<seg id="14">With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), a nationally acclaimed masterpiece will be released in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="15">Superseding ideas and stylistic finesse.</seg>
<seg id="16">The album rises into the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media.</seg>
<seg id="17">After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) to produce very extensive electronic sales.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sixth proper studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and Hall.</seg>
<seg id="19">The stage shows will become the colourful spectacle of Neon forehead bands and large fluorescent stages.</seg>
<seg id="20">Currently, Sufjan Stevens is touring as part of a five-member band through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the dark hamburger More!</seg>
<seg id="22">He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although nearly 2,000 guests are now locked in their chairs, the significantly matured Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without giving a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.</seg>
<seg id="25">From the audience you hear: The talk is "opulent" and you can basically throw away the "plate."</seg>
<seg id="26">Stevens's humble, acoustically plays few older songs and finally misses himself under dead applause.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Questions</seg>
<seg id="2">Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time is eagerly awaited</seg>
<seg id="3">New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at Prime Minister's Question Time and set up with David Cameron for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="4">MR Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six set questions shortly after noon, with his performance being considered by the media likely and Labour MPs from nearby.</seg>
<seg id="5">He called for "fewer theaters and more facts" at this weekly event.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also said he could skip some meetings to leave them colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it comes after being appointed a member of the Shadow Cabinet and following his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, the Labour chairman's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the sinking of the national anthem at a memorial ceremony on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the heart of several front page stories in the newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="9">MR Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and he acknowledged the Royal Air Force's "heroism in the air battle for England."</seg>
<seg id="11">But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, invoking differences in the economy, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also "stacking up" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's remarks on the position on the European Union and limiting profits.</seg>
<seg id="14">MR Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is proposing changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labor and pensions minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to cut the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">MR Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron since he is Tory chief, over the Dispatch box in parliament in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both "buzziness" and contending with reluctance and has instead undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">MR Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economics minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, if Mr Cameron is traveling abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has also raised the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor, and that he raised John Bercow, the speaker of the lower house, to discuss the problem.</seg>
<seg id="21">When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle theatre," often linked to Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he acknowledged that he had failed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of a leader's judgment and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his fellow MPs, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and that it needs far-reaching reforms.</seg>

<seg id="7">SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a 20% jump after taking on rival AB InBev.</seg>
<seg id="8">A transaction would combine the world's two largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.</seg>

<seg id="1">Metcash launches ground resistance campaign to fight aldi-</seg>
<seg id="2">Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground industry campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Aldi prepares to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.</seg>
<seg id="5">IGA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as ice maker Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and shopkeepers selling leveraged tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash's IGA shopkeepers and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="8">Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the East states.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will snap away about five per cent of the food market in these two states 12 months after opening its first markets and will take away all existing players, but mostly self-employed retailers.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to a report released this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash about $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley notes that Metcash's sales in the food and food business will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, down 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash would likely disappear within a decade.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass's comments.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr Douglass last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">IGAS's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting operating debt reduction at the same time on sales and margins.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the wholesaler is wrestling and investing more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers' ability to improve their stores through fast-growing fresh food and deliver better choice of private label foods.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcash's chief executive, Ian Morrice, says the price adjustments and store remediation programs will come to Elan and hopes the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by the president of Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of Australian tennis federation Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks," got into the spotlight by Kyrgios' infamous clash with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison calling out: "Wawrinka would have to beat Kyrgios and I should beat the child."</seg>
<seg id="6">While he was last seen smashing a tennis bat after a cramp thwarted a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.</seg>
<seg id="8">"One thing I'm pretty concerned about is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi was dragged a little into the dispute," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He smashed a racket when he lost because of a tie in the U.S. Open, but he's not the first player to have a racket of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him and I think he has been treated a little too tightly.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he's good in form, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he secures the man from Canberra as a long-term permanent part of the team. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on competition and not on all the controversies round [Kyrgios]," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I think Nick has made the rise very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions.</seg>

<seg id="8">Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" for migrants to be sent back from Hungary while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.</seg>
<seg id="9">(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.</seg>
<seg id="10">Talks must take place with Brussels and other countries in the coming days, "Ivica Dacic said in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="11">The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that an agreement would eventually be reached - next month or by the end of the year - that EU countries would accept another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="13">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special European Union summit to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on early action by Brussels or its neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="15">The state of emergency launched on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said his country was also planning to build a barbed wire mine along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.</seg>
<seg id="17">CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were deployed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="18">In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and a point of entry into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="19">Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most of the arrivals are economic refugees looking for a better life, rather than war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly at odds with other EU states, including Germany.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damage to the 4-metre (13-foot) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia, a crime that also imposes higher prison sentences on convicted traffickers.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Because of the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="22">We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.</seg>
<seg id="23">Parliament has yet to agree on the deployment of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gyorgy Bakondi, land security adviser for Orban, said authorities had 45 people in trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">They come up by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire to close the borders had arrived.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people's data and pressed a crowd to push back there.</seg>
<seg id="29">About 20 succeeded, but thousands remained outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link from Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead ahead of Bernie Sanders in national poll halved</seg>
<seg id="2">Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining her ground.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent earlier), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (rising 17 percent).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates, but those presenters have diminished.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind here.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now on equal footing.</seg>
<seg id="11">Clinton, however, still has a big lead among older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead at the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead at that group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of the Democratic voters of the primaries nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six per cent would not support them.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are mostly thrilled by her.</seg>
<seg id="17">The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - just about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this over their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton's supporters also mention her connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).</seg>
<seg id="21">Approval for dealing with the problems and selectivity is also cited.</seg>
<seg id="22">As the vice president casts a potential for the presidential primary, 57 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not.</seg>
<seg id="23">When Democratic voters are asked about who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the helm.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say Biden would be her second choice far ahead of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead increases before Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; but that figure has fallen by 78 percent last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is by far a second at this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most electable" has risen.</seg>
<seg id="28">Still, when asked about what is more important to a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about electability.</seg>
<seg id="29">Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for those voters of the primaries stands as unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results on some important features in their party's primaries.</seg>
<seg id="31">Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden cuts best among the three candidates at honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of Democratic voters don't believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him on that.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic voters of the primaries generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.</seg>
<seg id="35">For all these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server continue to be asked during the term as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters of the primaries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say it has not affected their opinions overall.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it's a different story in the American public as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">Public opinion on this was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans said the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinion of her had deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="41">It's mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views have gotten worse by Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="42">Although Clinton is seen by her party's voters as honest and trustworthy, this remains a problem for her among registered voters overall: Only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sixty-six percent of voters do not think they are an honest and trusted person.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 percent of voters nationwide see Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="45">Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks on leadership.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush perform best in honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">A majority see Sanders as more than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ben Carson is close to Donald Trump's latest poll by CBS News / New York Times</seg>
<seg id="3">The two candidates now account for half of voters' support in the new poll, and others are losing dramatically</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide, with support growing from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month, up 27% in Tuesday's poll.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="6">The poll also showed that Carson is doing well among demographic groups and that Trump is outperforming higher education among Republican voters.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been cut off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.</seg>
<seg id="8">Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are ranked third with 6%.</seg>
<seg id="9">The margin of error in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is Plus or Minus 6% and was conducted in September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The latest CNN / ORC poll released last week shows Carson rising in the polls - he landed at 19% support among Republicans, behind which Trump was 32% support.</seg>
<seg id="11">ABC News / Washington Post's latest poll also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.</seg>
<seg id="12">Looking ahead to a Carson rise last week, Trump found some sidelines for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College newcomer</seg>
<seg id="2">Nearly two years after a student died during a bullying ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of the New York-based Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials said he was saddled with connected eyes with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to get over a frozen field on a target.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Deng eventually complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">Members of the Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to hospital, according to police.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, they had the time to switch Dengs clothing, to goose his symptoms and Andy Meng, the Brotherhood's national president, to contact counsel, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, members began to hide utensils and basically put the good of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He could not be revived and he died the next morning of his injuries.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with blunt force injuries to head, hull and thigh.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood... at least one student has been dying of the bullying every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengs's family, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.</seg>
<seg id="13">A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge of murder of third-degree murder for the first five members.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with bullying and forming a criminal association.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We don't just want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that - officially or unofficial - has sanctioned this, so we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation with the local group.</seg>

<seg id="1">That will happen if the Fed raises interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">An increase in interest rates comes, and home prices are set to falter, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">We know that.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last.</seg>
<seg id="5">In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result, US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.</seg>
<seg id="9">In fact, several variables play a role.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end, however, market participants may find that the whole excitement of an increase in interest rates has perhaps been exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of" cheap money, "Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal highs, but still to low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, that does not mean there will be no impact.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here's a historical trend-based look at how some areas of the economy might respond:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market saw last month, anticipating interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while.</seg>
<seg id="16">Once the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There appears to be a tendency for asset yields to be strangled 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after interest rate increases in the Fed.</seg>
<seg id="18">More specifically, in the past 35 years, the market has mostly been in the upward trend - about 14 per cent - on the road to interest rate increases, pretty flat in the 250 days after (average profit of 2.6 per cent), then back to normal state after 500 days, with an average return on the past six cycles of 14.4 per cent, according to a recent analysis firm.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increases cycle and that returns start to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rates often encourage them.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current case, the Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the Fed's interest rate hike.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Interest rate increases at such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question "whether it is different this time," Deutsche Bank said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants have taken the whole year on an interest rate hike from the Fed, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in that session, futures trading only gives up a 25 percent probability.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study, all the increases have taken place from 1950 to today in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre-recession levels have been coming into the shadows very quickly after the start of the recovery," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="29">By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are 74 months so far.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is pretty similar to that in the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on equities when those change their strategic rate.</seg>
<seg id="33">For bonds, returns appear to change direction once the first increase / reduction is made in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the increases cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Charles Schwab's strategists believe the rise in interest rates will lead to returns between longer and shorter bonds, leading to a slump in the curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High-interest bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still cautious about expecting higher yields," Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">What is interesting is that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tougher monetary policy," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, credit packets have expanded and volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.</seg>
<seg id="40">By and large, companies that handle the larger portion of their business in the US will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, as well as financing their debts.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that" quality "shares tend to respond exceedingly positively three months after an initial rate increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with a strong balance sheet have surpassed an average of 5 percentage points on average after each of the rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">Debt will be a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers could see gains through higher yields, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will take place.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MPs Andrew Bingham</seg>
<seg id="2">The Conservative member of parliament criticized the broadcaster for its' dumby'</seg>
<seg id="3">He argues that he is increasingly not different from commercial rivals.</seg>
<seg id="4">He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they only imitated The Brits</seg>
<seg id="5">Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said this was not very original.</seg>
<seg id="6">BBC Radio 3 "converts" to Classic FM, claiming a leading parliamentary member and increasing new pressure on the broadcaster to prove he is doing something private broadcasters don't do.</seg>
<seg id="7">Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public-sector radio station was "disillusioned" and increasingly no longer distinct from its commercial competitors.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word" dumbfounded "- but it seems to turn to Classic FM," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, appear to be The Brits only under a different name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you are actually just mimicking what is already on the market, "said Mr Bingham.</seg>
<seg id="12">BBC director-general dismissed the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is well ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educating the public.</seg>
<seg id="13">What I get from Radio 3, I won't learn about classical music anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="14">And there's a commitment to live music and music that's really unmatched.</seg>
<seg id="15">"And the commitment of Radio 3 to finding new music and commissioned new works, I also think really important," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that harder work had to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because Britons are less informed about classical music.</seg>
<seg id="17">Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production that was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Choice of Culture, Media and Sport to step down commercial rivals.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.</seg>

<seg id="20">Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a special BBC way."</seg>
<seg id="21">He added that he wanted the company to "find a hit from our in-house stall" when it launched an entertainment series next time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Internet sales rose the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this</seg>
<seg id="2">In the first three months of 2015, there was seven per cent increase in online sales.</seg>
<seg id="3">Last month there was the lowest result since records began in 2000</seg>
<seg id="4">Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shop</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe Black Friday slowed spending in November</seg>
<seg id="6">For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.</seg>
<seg id="7">But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven per cent in the first three months of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Total spending for August represented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only five per cent increase over the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed just seven per cent growth in the first three months of 2015</seg>
<seg id="10">"If you look at growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, that has always evolved over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index told the Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="11">He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="12">It meant more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="13">But now this is commonplace, and we may see growth diminishing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The black-Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the waning turnovers.</seg>
<seg id="15">Experts believe buyers will withhold their purchases before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year, five times the average number of buyers screamed around their computers to make their bargains, and some dealer websites crashed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Experts believe Black Friday, at which buyers battled for bargains, could stop buyers from making purchases.</seg>
<seg id="18">A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of £5 spent slightly more than £1 online.</seg>
<seg id="19">For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now carried out via web shops.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.</seg>

<seg id="12">Saudi officials have already determined that the Haddsch will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.</seg>
<seg id="13">Today, King Salman said the Bin Laden group should not have steered the arm of the wreath when it was not used.</seg>
<seg id="14">An Arab version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Bin Laden group was complicit in the collapse.</seg>
<seg id="15">The news agency's English-language service did not report that detail, but said the company's leadership was banned from travelling abroad.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the sick, who crashed into an inner courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddsch, which takes place later this month.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Bin-Laden group has issued no statements about the collapse de Krans, and its representatives were not available for comment.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Royal Decree also tadled the group for non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dozens of cranes surround Mekka's big mosque as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin-Laden group.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Bin Laden family has been linked to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and is taking on major construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="21">The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a breakaway son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990 "s.</seg>
<seg id="22">The wreath's crash came amid heavy winds and rain, just days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="23">Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="24">Officials ordered that 1 million Rial (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed and the same amount of permanently injured.</seg>

<seg id="1">B & Q boss says time is ahead of cheap Eastern European craftsmen</seg>
<seg id="2">Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury</seg>
<seg id="3">The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has surged</seg>
<seg id="4">This leads to the opening of 200 other Screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets nationwide</seg>
<seg id="6">By Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail</seg>
<seg id="7">It is claimed that Britons lay down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen doing the work in their home</seg>
<seg id="8">If you can send a hammer or brush to remove walls, you seem to belong to a minority nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to perform home-grown jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B & Q.</seg>
<seg id="10">Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, which owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now outdated.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and closing 60 outlets of B & Q.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mrs Laury said she wants to employ more women in B & Q shops because eight out of 10 purchase decisions in the store are made by women.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the moment, the men outweigh the staff.</seg>
<seg id="14">She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mrs Laury said: "It still works a majority of men in our branches.</seg>
<seg id="16">We need to move this towards a balance.</seg>
<seg id="17">In principle, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of decisions on the purchase of articles by women.</seg>
<seg id="18">Women play a major role in the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a leading company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also revamped her top team to reflect a similar number of men and women in leadership positions.</seg>
<seg id="20">Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and finance arm.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kingfisher reported a drop in half-year profits and sales after the group owed the cost of closing stores.</seg>
<seg id="24">Because of the trend Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new stores.</seg>

<seg id="1">Officials of Aich / Dob due to infidelity in court</seg>
<seg id="2">On Wednesday, at Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian volleyball star Aich / Dob have to answer for infidelity and abortion.</seg>
<seg id="3">The defendants were not guilty.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of them was also charged with abuse of office.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was legally acquitted of this charge in May.</seg>
<seg id="6">The current process has been postponed.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to District Attorney Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it emerged that the defendants used funds from club accounts over which they were allowed to dispense in their functions for private purposes in 2006-2011.</seg>
<seg id="8">He cites the damage with around 400,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sports officials are also charged with financial offences.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was the fact that the chairman of the Schopenensenate, Judge Michaela Sanin, was leaving.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is to be negotiated at a later stage.</seg>
<seg id="12">To dismiss the infidelity, the defense stated that at no time had an asset been created.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sports officials would only have billed expenses and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011, in which they had invested a lot of time and money, had run out of debt - the Passiva was about 600,000 chilling ($444,000) in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="14">"At the time we were facing the situation: Do we continue to run the club or block us?" One of the defendants, in the brothel profession of large-scale financial investigators.</seg>
<seg id="15">He then decided with his colleague and co-defendant to take on this task.</seg>
<seg id="16">With all risks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We have imposed money, executed our life insurance as a security at the bank," he said at the arrest.</seg>
<seg id="18">With the club agreed: They can manage the money freely, only no debt must be made.</seg>
<seg id="19">Furthermore, in the event of financial success, the disbursement of expenses was decided retroactively until 1991.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, some of the expenses paid off only years later, from 2003, when a plus was in the account.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a result, flat-rate and non-detailed bookings appeared, the former Obmann explained the transactions.</seg>
<seg id="22">The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Why the withdrawals had not been disclosed to the club in detail, the judge asked.</seg>
<seg id="24">The club didn't care in detail about financial management, important was just debt free, according to the answer.</seg>
<seg id="25">When an official began an investigation into abuse of power in 2011, a sum of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those were reserves, the defendants said.</seg>
<seg id="27">This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the club, according to his statement.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Why?" The judge wanted to know.</seg>
<seg id="29">The respondents did not know a response.</seg>
<seg id="30">He then finally thought that this was the best thing for the club.</seg>
<seg id="31">If anything had happened to him, no one would have known anything about that money, the prosecutor put in the room.</seg>
<seg id="32">The co-defendant was informed, the official justified himself.</seg>
<seg id="33">This transfer was formulated as "compensation for damages."</seg>
<seg id="34">Why claims?, judge and prosecutor wanted to know.</seg>
<seg id="35">On that, the first defendant said he did not agree with that phrase because the club had never suffered any damage.</seg>
<seg id="36">But what should I do when the lawyer says, "With that, you're all out of the tailor."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Am I a legal representative?" He asked.</seg>
<seg id="38">Furthermore, the official said he never received a cent salary, saying he only billed mileage and diets.</seg>
<seg id="39">On diets, he charged the club £1,000 a month, but the actual expense was much higher, he added.</seg>
<seg id="40">Exact documents for the early years could not be provided by the defendants.</seg>
<seg id="41">They were not kept after an operating audit in which everything had been judged correct, they said.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mileage was also related to the second defendant.</seg>
<seg id="43">All the closures were made in cash, to which he had to go from his place of residence to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.</seg>
<seg id="44">The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.</seg>

<seg id="2">In addition to three years of staff reductions, the computer giant will reduce further jobs when the company is split.</seg>
<seg id="3">The pitfalls at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) do not end.</seg>
<seg id="4">As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer business.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is expected to save costs of $2.7 billion ($2.4 billion), the company said Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The move will result in a special charge of around $2.7 billion, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="7">The three-year reduction of 55,000 jobs has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="8">HP still employed some 302,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14.</seg>

<seg id="12">Another disappointing PC sales, as well as weaker demand from corporate customers for its services, were the second-largest PC manufacturer in the world after Lenovo.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the third quarter ended July, sales of PC and printers fell 11.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sales fell 8 percent to just $25.4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a result, the proceeds declined in 15 of 16 quarters.</seg>
<seg id="16">HP responds with a split and massive job cuts to change in the industry.</seg>
<seg id="17">The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has reacted late in the day that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets rather than traditional computers and are increasingly doing business online.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world is watching when the US Federal Reserve meets on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">A survey among 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half who thought last week that the Fed would do so now thinks the Fed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed put interest rates on NULL.</seg>
<seg id="5">"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may be leaving the zero area and launching a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief executive at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The US economy is at a relatively good level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global conditions.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has warned markets to adjust to an increase, but signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.</seg>

<seg id="2">After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" at the first murder and wanted "he could do it unscathed," authorities announced Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10: 00 on Monday morning</seg>
<seg id="4">And said he shot at someone and killed someone.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lamb told the emergency department's staff that police had to send police to his home.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" was in the house but that "no one will disturb" but will probably be excited.</seg>
<seg id="7">Police asked the caller about his name, but he did not give him.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.</seg>
<seg id="9">When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, who said: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.</seg>
<seg id="10">I loved Amy, and she's the only woman ever loved me. "</seg>
<seg id="11">After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before eventually taking his own life on Monday evening when police raided him.</seg>
<seg id="12">University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lambs's imagination."</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship."</seg>
<seg id="14">Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married about seven years ago, as a "good person."</seg>
<seg id="15">The two were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.</seg>
<seg id="16">O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "destroyed on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="17">He said Prentiss was her daughter's "absolutely best friends."</seg>
<seg id="18">Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.</seg>
<seg id="19">Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had met with Lamb for about three years.</seg>
<seg id="20">"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said</seg>
<seg id="21">Police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time Monday to tell them "he is not going to jail."</seg>
<seg id="22">When police officers picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.</seg>
<seg id="23">Lamb received a doctoral degree from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to his lifeline on the university's website.</seg>

<seg id="6">Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and upgrading low-cost Eurowings.</seg>
<seg id="7">The aim of the realignment is a result contribution of around €500 million a year from cost and redemption strategies, the airline said Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer be responsible for the passenger business.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eurowings budget airline should be developed as independently as possible.</seg>
<seg id="10">Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the board of Chief Carsten Spohr.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the new edition, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, which the Group intends to oppose Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, the organisation of the 120 000 employees has been complex.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's one thing all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't take long before you almost know it.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unless you may be David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the prime minister opted for The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fence of Dr Seuss.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company's website SuperCamps, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read out to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or message we've missed so far."</seg>
<seg id="6">All fine and good, except that the subsequent paragraph, in which Cameron reportedly describes the book's action, instead reproduces a summary of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the midst of the surrounding town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads: A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose verlance was unknown.</seg>
<seg id="8">As if this was not yet suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads in part as the summary of the Lorax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins: "In the revamped city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy hopes to win a boy named Ted, hopes.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron will be familiar with the book's action so little.</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely to come from Cameron's constituency office.</seg>
<seg id="12">SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff but gave no further immediate comments.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you look at the caddie that England selected for the Tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my map.</seg>
<seg id="3">I wouldn't rule out an upside victory.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair Cooks' side may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting draw, and the community spirit is strong; they won't wear scars of 2012, just a juicy-positive attitude.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the ball developing Moeen Ali as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size on Test level, is an option for the attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related news: Adam Lyth leaves the England Test caddie and is replaced by Alex Hales.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, hard for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyze.</seg>
<seg id="8">In his seven tests, there were two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are focused on results.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I said so earlier - players are their own best selectors.</seg>
<seg id="10">Long ago, one would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control of his own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">If he hopefully picks up more runs for Yorkshire, another chance comes.</seg>
<seg id="12">The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he didn't deliver such good performances, and that doesn't surprise me; he's primarily a team man.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how much time a Test batter receives to set his mark is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only accusation you can raise was that England first put Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in maximum form - but that lost chance is now in the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hales comes in and he's a drummer I appreciate highly.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's an X-factor cricket player what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge spot, which hit us very much.</seg>
<seg id="19">He has to get at least the same opportunities as those before him, but this obviously depends on the managerial performance in the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea of beating Moeen alongside Cook, which would provide an extra-spin bowler and get four Quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't see why a batter can't beat there, and this left-hander has already shown he is a felony of cricket players.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but is he a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at the first drop before joining as an opener in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24">He made three hundred Runs immediately and didn't look back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari arrives in the caddie as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he very impressed me as a young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People may look at his statistics - an average of 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there's no big number of backup spinning players who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">He will learn a lot on this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">Apart from the team, England have made a few clever additions at the coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as an adviser to the Test matches could be a championship coup.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the most nice guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood arrives for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful bet into the setup.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always felt he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes new voices can bring fresh winds in the dressing room, even if the news is in line with what has been said earlier.</seg>
<seg id="34">Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, will not be deployed at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it.</seg>
<seg id="35">Some will not agree, but Coaches and team creators do not determine the timetable.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you have to remember that as with players, their jobs depend on the results.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions are not taken lightly.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Brexit camp (Brexit = exit of Britain from the EU) could gain in Zulauf if the economy gets into a rot by 2017</seg>
<seg id="2">David Cameron's outspoken renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to leader of Labour or the TUC, who clashed heavily because of Europe on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.</seg>
<seg id="4">A European diplomat's friend recently said that some member states, as deeply embroiled in various crises as the EU is now, and not always on their own fault, are fed up with Britain's self-prepared agenda with divided concessions and disruptive treaty changes they mostly don't want.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it also does not like it if it endangers social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie's agenda.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prime Minister and finance ministers are climbing at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then coming home and saying they are winning allies for reform.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's always about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European friend, who wants an outside Britain inside the EU tent - "Lass us not alone with France," says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany's cautious chancellor, Angela Merkel, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the overly long-running like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).</seg>
<seg id="11">France's François Hollande looks to his re-election or replacement in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is also a fading force.</seg>
<seg id="13">Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a leftist.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is difficult to imagine that they will be sufficient to help the selfie British, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they don't want because most of the similar separatist tendencies have.</seg>
<seg id="15">So some such ministers may even deliberately plan unhelpful remarks, quite SNP-style, during Britain's referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The renegotiation was a default" and "Britain has not won anything of value from renegotiation."</seg>
<seg id="17">Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at its expense and which EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.</seg>
<seg id="18">You can feel weak about Boris Johnson, the ore euro opportunists who made a name as an "EU straight banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90's.</seg>
<seg id="19">In all his ruthlessness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.</seg>
<seg id="20">This included the Medley of tax-prone villains, phone hacker foreigners and the pseudo non-indigenous who own most of our major newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, Tony Blair thought similar about her, but noted that when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distribute bananas to distract him rather than become at his lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum swirl, because Blair had put the principle on the unapproved EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press has never sidelined him.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly claps on his back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer needed time for me to waste - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 80's, a mistake at the time and today.</seg>
<seg id="25">It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I am very friendly - in development.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says we should remain in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Well, most people outside Ukips traditional Broad-arbutant tendency and the wild filming of Torys Klein-Engnationism can well say yes.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's what Hilary said "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn on radio and television this week said when the scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 70-year-old when his old father tried to be illoyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilary's fight was even more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But struggling to stay "under all circumstances" - Benns's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his comrades and MPs after all the reports at their small-scale meeting on Monday night.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whatever Corbyn's touching bottom-up image wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the Strudel of Social Media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe, which allows him to consider Labours support in the referendum campaign a matter of course, as McDonnell said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguity about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.</seg>
<seg id="37">As with his ambiguities to Nato - Tom Watson is rocky convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be required to try to find in everything a sense of their superiors at home.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless?</seg>
<seg id="39">The US is already rather disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded at the launch on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticize report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes</seg>
<seg id="2">Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, in part with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (phe) in its report on e-cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Phe published the "principle report" last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">But some researchers questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which phe justified its main conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked if the claims "build on stone or sand."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">They said the public expects that phe's assertion that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision-making analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to lead their opinions on the damage from various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director had previously received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also signed BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but did not add to the funding he was supposed to receive, according to reports earlier by tobacco company Philip Morris International.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reasons for selecting members of the panel are not delivered, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also specify industry funding in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">The meeting also included the tobacco management of phe.</seg>
<seg id="17">The group's research work "admits tellingly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage to most products on most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the phe report.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Capewell said that phe's claims that "there has been no evidence so far that e-cigarettes were" premature as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers. "</seg>
<seg id="20">Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at phe, said that response to BMJ's claims had already been made.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">Every second life smoker dies from his addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All the evidence suggests that e-cigarettes' health risks are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term impact.</seg>
<seg id="24">Phe has a clear duty to inform the public about what is evidence and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System £2bn a year.</seg>
<seg id="26">By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking are our national competence.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC should abandon EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4</seg>
<seg id="2">The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice, saying that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs not sent through other UK channels.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticized the BBC for placing public-sector programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard-fought time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and by broadcasters like BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the BBC's director-general, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast, which would also clearly be shown by unsubsidized rivals," Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least place your production on programmes that others do not make or commission.</seg>
<seg id="8">They send The Voice in a first-class window because they want to achieve as much support as possible for their future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's nonsense, of course.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax is funding programs that could also be funded without subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for it.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am trying to see how this should be public television.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think that would reduce the BBC at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, an entrepreneur for series that directed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was guilty of hunting for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people working there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said that the more public-sector niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can't measure pretty much the audience, but they perform their duties, and they can argue that if they go on their apparent holy missions to justify £4 billion broadcasting fees," Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that no one has seen. "</seg>
<seg id="18">They put them in a window of opportunity where no one ever wanted to see them.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the radio charge, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of terms of who can get the best value out of it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course, you all think we all think you get a big value here for £150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the £150, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">Former Sky- and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, train and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="22">He said little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1 per cent of its TV production and 0.1 per cent on radio - and it should take an example to public television stations in Australia and Canada to "inform, clarify and entertain this."</seg>
<seg id="23">On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as that of the Proms, of which he said only a handful are shown on television, and with the commercial broadcasters taking alliances to make everything available online.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">The video shows how the Nematodes change the direction at the moment they are aired with sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment they are aired with sound waves that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.</seg>
<seg id="5">The impulses work by switching motoneuron cells genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further on this subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulse into people's brain to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fadenworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bubbles, he found out, amplify ultrasound waves that then penetrate the worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reinforced ultrasonic waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to, according to a report Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically changed worms so some of its motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.</seg>
<seg id="14">When it applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microwaves and transferred to the worms where they switch the modified motoneurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons into and out with impulses of light.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Chalasani said Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unlike light, which has to be lowered to the desired spot in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic tissues can pass freely and thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.</seg>

<seg id="16">One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries.</seg>
<seg id="18">Many artists are working with activists within protest movements, noting that they need to go outside to the real world so that their art has an influence on society.</seg>
<seg id="19">Another of the anti-gun drug posters greets commuters in the subway.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works nonprofit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.</seg>
<seg id="21">VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the gun trade - through a leaf of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Do we give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."</seg>
<seg id="22">They played with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertising, but "by engaging with bright colors and animation it remains more liable."</seg>
<seg id="23">"They did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," Tom Davies of Amnesty says.</seg>
<seg id="24">What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded illegally on our doorstep.</seg>
<seg id="25">Perhaps the most creative art around the Arms Fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors froze fantastically euphemistic products.</seg>

<seg id="1">Eight golden rules for life in student homes</seg>
<seg id="2">Eleven years ago I moved to a student's home as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smile of those I annoyed - and to the numerous, long-suffering complaints about others.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">The entry into student homes ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely terrifying.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's tempting to snap: People tell where you get, whether and where you've taken Sabbath year, where you're in terms of Corbyn and why you're "frankly Marmite neither love nor hate it because in earnest, guys, it's just a heap extract haha, I'm in my room."</seg>
<seg id="6">Breathe through.</seg>
<seg id="7">And help others do the same - put questions and show interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">It directs the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Let people.</seg>
<seg id="10">People's rooms are often transformed into drinks receptions, movie night venues and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people are moving and putting their underwear on.</seg>
<seg id="11">Related: Don't remember to start at the university with a relationship</seg>
<seg id="12">Introverted receive rough treatment at university.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a space-to-space bump culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.</seg>
<seg id="14">That can be the hell for someone trying to recover.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so I get the energy I used to interact with you."</seg>
<seg id="16">Try to feel when a commilitone of conviviality is exhausted - and send it a text message instead of knocking.</seg>
<seg id="17">Speaking of knock: Do it.</seg>
<seg id="18">A guy in my student's homes had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.</seg>
<seg id="19">He saw some things.</seg>
<seg id="20">Friendship close by baking.</seg>
<seg id="21">As you start the university at the height of the back mania, the clutching of people's doors to imagine a plate full of brownies is less strange than the greeting of the 1950 "s" Welcome to the neighborhood, I have some baked... so, and now please smile, if I ask you a personal question. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friendships.</seg>
<seg id="23">Your fellow residents feel obliged to entertain themselves and may end up associating your face with a delicious surprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.</seg>
<seg id="25">Badly missed clumps of flour, sugar and fat lead people to sleep when you knock.</seg>
<seg id="26">Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Of course, clawing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea, too?</seg>
<seg id="28">Check this with the dairy owner.</seg>
<seg id="29">The chances are good that they say they serve themselves, even if they cook inside.</seg>

<seg id="1">Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners</seg>
<seg id="2">The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses for people who do not have much money.</seg>
<seg id="3">So for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only do refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low-earner."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I show how you can still build cheap and good today," the 44-year-old says in the interview</seg>
<seg id="5">Thousands of refugees will push into the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes in knowing how quickly to create affordable housing: He is building up terraced houses for refugees in a project.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Gildner, many refugees will push into the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="8">What solution do you offer?</seg>
<seg id="9">Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers or turkeys has no sustainability.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because people remain to a large extent here.</seg>
<seg id="11">Given the flow of refugees, we also need sufficient housing over the next few decades.</seg>
<seg id="12">A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gildner: A terraced house needs least space.</seg>
<seg id="14">It facilitates integration.</seg>
<seg id="15">That's different from subjecting people into residential blocks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Each of the six houses that are being built in the pilot project consists of three units of residence for four asylum seekers each.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I go back.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs.</seg>
<seg id="20">How much are the costs?</seg>
<seg id="21">Gildner: The price of 160 square feet of living space per house is 184 000 euros, without a plot.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is manageable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Six months has passed construction.</seg>
<seg id="24">That is appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="25">Have construction rules complicated their plans?</seg>
<seg id="26">Gildner: I got my project correctly.</seg>
<seg id="27">In particular, it always makes the looming Damocesque value special construction and the pitch regulation.</seg>
<seg id="28">Grinning.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is still understated who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three pitches.</seg>
<seg id="30">Only in cities there is no place for this.</seg>
<seg id="31">And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">How did residents respond to their terraced project?</seg>
<seg id="33">Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="34">Which is definitely not true.</seg>
<seg id="35">But don't you exacerbate competition for affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="36">Gildner: True, we've had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years, but built luxury apartments that can barely afford one more.</seg>
<seg id="37">My project has the message, even ordinary people need housing.</seg>
<seg id="38">Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-earner.</seg>
<seg id="39">I show how we can still build cheap and good today.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is what we are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="41">Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analysis.</seg>

<seg id="2">The new operating system can be requested by going to the hiring app, typing on "General" and then "Software Update."</seg>
<seg id="3">If it's ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message that tells you that the "software update failed."</seg>
<seg id="5">To bypass the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update through iTunes.</seg>
<seg id="6">The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.</seg>
<seg id="7">This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made this more unlikely by streamlining the update, and it will be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's worth making sure your mobile phone is uploaded during the upgrade or is near a charger so the battery is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may be shut down halfway and this could lead to a crash of the update.</seg>

<seg id="2">Saludis and the Antonistift Altencenter have joined forces under the mantle of the Social Foundation and opened a new one-stop shop at Graf-Stauffenberg Square.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition to discussions, courses can also be held there.</seg>
<seg id="4">The social foundation draws it from the mountain to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="5">More specifically, at Graf-Stauffenberg Square.</seg>
<seg id="6">A new Quartiere office was recently opened there.</seg>
<seg id="7">Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and councillors will now receive information on issues such as health care insurance or health care benefits.</seg>
<seg id="8">For years we have found with our outpatient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are a great many questions.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Also, not often many of the benefits of the coffers are not used because the complexity of insurance is barely understood," explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonist and Civic Hospital as well as for the ambulance service "Amadeus."</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to the discussions, the new QuartiersBureau also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Saludis has been taken to this end.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore additional offers such as storm prevention, memory training or physiotherapy can be used.</seg>
<seg id="14">The offers of the senior centre and the Saludis are ideal.</seg>
<seg id="15">Saludis stands for prevention, preparedness and rehab.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The senior management center for care and care," Heike Riedel, managing director of Saludis said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The reason for the opening of the new QuartiersOffice in the city centre is that both business leaders look particularly at demographic change.</seg>
<seg id="18">Because this makes a good decentralised infrastructure essential in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the inauguration ceremony, the QuartiersBureau also dedicated itself to the association at the age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite you to a regular societal presence."</seg>
<seg id="20">The social foundation thus makes a big contribution that seniors can live as independently as possible and well in their familiar environment.</seg>
<seg id="21">The QuartiersBureau is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="2">Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felsteausen.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition to this, you will also be able to benefit from the Master of Music, Bernd Bormann, the Business Promotion in Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf Mayor Heinfried Kabbert.</seg>
<seg id="4">In many places in the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes on the practice of field breaks on 1 October.</seg>
<seg id="5">While Ursel Felsteausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still standing by half a spot in the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="6">After a reconstruction phase, Muller reopens the practice on October 12, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was sympathy at first sight when the rock performers met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing their studies at the Verne Hospital and is also planning to enter into practice next year.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We always had in mind that the garbage users would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felsteausen and laughs.</seg>
<seg id="9">"When it was, I just called them."</seg>
<seg id="10">To the Ehepaar Müller, the idea of pursuing its own practice in Asendorf in the future.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."</seg>
<seg id="13">As an advantage, he also looks to be his own boss soon.</seg>
<seg id="14">And so one agreed, the garbage makers bought the house with the practice.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.</seg>
<seg id="16">The two-time family friend Frank Müller also grew up there, and his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several physicians' offices and hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is currently active as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed chief medical officer in Diepholz County and volunteered in the DRK-readiness Bruchhausen-Vilsen.</seg>
<seg id="18">From September 19, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.</seg>
<seg id="19">His wife Ursel (Internistin) specializes in gastroenterology.</seg>
<seg id="20">The garbage makers, both internists, want to settle as family doctors.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The endoscopy therefore comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.</seg>
<seg id="22">After reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.</seg>
<seg id="23">We will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long-term and stress EKGS and need a speaker room more.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, the EDV is completely renewed.</seg>
<seg id="25">A total grant of €50000 will be paid to the trash farmers under a grant programme from the county (€25,000) and the Samtgemeinde (€12500) and the municipality (€12500).</seg>
<seg id="26">"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," notes sampling director Bernd Bormann.</seg>
<seg id="27">According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients come into practice each quarter, in which North German average practice is about 500.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Asendorf there is another doctor's practice.</seg>
<seg id="29">A positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felsteausen.</seg>
<seg id="30">If no successor had found herself, she would have gone.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you are visiting refuse speakers, you will continue to look mainly at familiar faces: The seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the field.</seg>
<seg id="32">With their departure, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, physicians practiced there for 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="33">"At the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel Felsteausen remembers.</seg>
<seg id="34">A bit of cheerfulness is already feeling it after the long time.</seg>
<seg id="35">"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients often," says the Internistin.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her husband added laughingly: "We have a 6000-square-foot plot."</seg>
<seg id="37">"So far I've always pressed myself before gardening, now that could be different."</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.</seg>

<seg id="1">Croatia: "We let the refugees through"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Now border controls are also ramping up on our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Controls on the Hungarian border remain consistent.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can make it "self-evident."</seg>
<seg id="5">People's care and safety are at the forefront.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," the minister said.</seg>
<seg id="7">People need to know that we do not accept boundless migratory flows, not even via the Austrian-Slovenian border.</seg>
<seg id="8">It needs a controlled approach.</seg>
<seg id="9">Croatia weighs' corridor '- Slovenia denied</seg>
<seg id="10">The Croatian Government had previously informed that Slovenia also wanted to allow incoming refugees to travel to Austria and Germany and could also set up corridors for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, this was not the case in Laibach.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," but Slovenia will intensify the monitoring of the border, especially with Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="13">The border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="14">As the Minister stressed, Slowenin does not want to unlock his borders on refugees.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Any EU member must comply with its obligations otherwise the system cannot function," stressed GYÖRKÖS Znidar.</seg>
<seg id="16">As the Croatian Government indicated, the first refugees had already tried in the night hours of Tuesday to travel past Tovarnik / Sid border crossing in eastern Croatia to avoid registration.</seg>
<seg id="17">Croatian police were able to pick them up in nearby corn fields.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in Croatia's Tovarnik region since then.</seg>
<seg id="19">They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the coming days, his country is counting around 4000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moreover, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="23">The government in Belgrade denied, however, that it was to suggest to the people that certain routes should be taken: "Neither can we, nor do we," it said.</seg>
<seg id="24">In any case, according to media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses would be expected during the day.</seg>
<seg id="25">About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany</seg>
<seg id="26">The inmates had been travelling all night from Serbia's roughly 500-kilometer Macedonian border.</seg>
<seg id="27">"We have heard that Hungary has done so, so the police have told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">They wanted to travel further through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.</seg>
<seg id="29">This could actually lead to the postponement of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, already predicted by observers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Croatia: "Comprehensive border control options"</seg>
<seg id="31">Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="32">He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member has "comprehensive border control capabilities."</seg>
<seg id="33">Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="34">Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, and the EU's partners have been consistently reporting to the country on the standard of border controls.</seg>
<seg id="35">On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to Belgrader's media reports, they had spent the past night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.</seg>
<seg id="37">According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="39">Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local show in Horgos: He considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees to be premature after the Hungarian border is now closed.</seg>
<seg id="40">It would not be very high numbers of refugees at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.</seg>
<seg id="42">Aid workers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes</seg>
<seg id="43">However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun distributing maps to refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not undangerous: In parts of the border area, there are still uncovered mines 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.</seg>
<seg id="45">On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of miners was sent to the border region.</seg>

<seg id="2">Supranonok is said to have heard a ring of cybercriminals accused of repeatedly gaining insight into yet unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaked information is said to have made insider dealing in financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this way, according to investigators, more than $100 million was received.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately caught," the SEC statement said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ecumenical hospice aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="2">Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a good operation.</seg>
<seg id="3">People do their concerns, some quick paces, some cosy bumbling.</seg>
<seg id="4">They control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalon at Paradeplatz.</seg>
<seg id="5">Keep trams.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pulsating, prall life with glorious autumn sunshine and in four large panels each with the headline "I'm dying"....</seg>
<seg id="7">The Ecumenical hospice aid drew attention to its 20-year existence and is facing mixed reactions.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's about life, so we've gone with the action in the middle of town and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.</seg>
<seg id="9">The head of Ecumenical hospice assistance is available to the passers-by as well as for questions and conversations as the volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">While manch spontaneously picks up a passer-by and admits the phrase around "my life," "read," "with the camper driving through the US," "stop the war" or "don't suffer long," others stay short, read, say sentences like "so far I'm not yet" and then go on.</seg>
<seg id="11">Time and again, small discussions about the action itself, about life, dealing with dying.</seg>
<seg id="12">Peter Hübinger is also just on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Only by making it clear to me that at some point the end of this world is coming, I can live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonic Plant Mannheim, which is co-operating with the Caritan Federation of Ecumenical Hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, this high-profile action for 20-year-olds is good.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is understandable, however, that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, but it is a very personal matter.</seg>
<seg id="16">The subject of death and dying remains fraught with taboos, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although just the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to people opening up.</seg>
<seg id="17">An assessment that shares Angelika Godefroid.</seg>
<seg id="18">The death and marriage attendant is one of the volunteers of the first hour.</seg>
<seg id="19">Confronted by personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the Ecumenical hospice aid sought honor official by calling, she immediately reported and was present at the foundation in 1995.</seg>
<seg id="21">Godefroid is part of a team of 45 honorary officials - 43 women and two men - who are involved in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospiz of St Vincent.</seg>
<seg id="22">They are all carefully trained.</seg>
<seg id="23">Angelika Godefroid can do well with her job and experience and experiences.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I see life from another waiting, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.</seg>
<seg id="25">The offer of the ambulance Ecumenical hospice service is free and confessional.</seg>
<seg id="26">The financial support of health insurance funds and donations from family members and clubs enables training, training and supervisions of death and marriage attendants.</seg>
<seg id="27">Every two years training courses are offered for new employees.</seg>
<seg id="28">The panels described on Saturday are now on display at the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and at the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).</seg>
<seg id="29">Further personal requests can also be noted on postcards.</seg>

<seg id="1">FedEx earnings mixed, financial outlook lowered for 2016</seg>
<seg id="2">FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the berth giant cut its profit outlook to a full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground sports service.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="4">At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.</seg>
<seg id="5">The stock fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx Corp. said it earned a profit of between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than at the previous forecast.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lower outlook comes despite the increase in prices, which averages 4.9 per cent and will be effective on 4 January, despite higher premiums for ground sports from heavy and large packages that will be collected from November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said it still expects earnings to increase compared with the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and because of growth in online trading.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "provides solid returns when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."</seg>
<seg id="11">Plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just below the $2.44 per share forecast by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sales rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six of Zacks surveyed analysts expected $12.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, bringing sales in its unit Express shipments to stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last quarter, sales in ground racing rose 29 percent, but operating earnings were basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labor costs in the cargo business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">At its most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the ladder for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="2">Drowning over them at an end to the decorated, two-story sitting room is a mural of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are expected to put the nation's economic interests ahead of all other things.</seg>
<seg id="4">The central bank has a two-fold mandate from Congress: Maximizing U.S. employment and prices here to keep steady.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an undefeated third mandate: Financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And that third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it, and it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is starved to be defused by the unprecedented incentive by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although most data from the economy show that it is growing solid, recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already cautious Fed officials anxious to step up that volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds - and be it just a quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself inhibits the financial market.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently predicted a rate increase this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">Financial markets, however, expect a delay from the Fed, with a key indicator showing only a 30 per cent chance of an increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">This suggests a fall in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far off.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">It would be a surprise if the Fed lifted rates at this time, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If she does, "she would have to go very far in her statement to calm financial markets so they don't panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expects an increase in the rate.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed sees as full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="24">And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, Fed officials said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But financial markets around the world poured together late last month after China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 16% below its peak in May as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would cut global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now down nearly 10% below May's peak.</seg>
<seg id="29">For Fed officials, market turmoil affects complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="30">"If events in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would attract the reins in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. Federal Reserve employee.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now he predicts she will wait at least a month to get better grip on the impact.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," Oliner said.</seg>
<seg id="33">The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main concerns, so it should not technically be included in its decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="34">But ultimately, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.</seg>
<seg id="35">The central bank's influence has been huge in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mere indication by then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for the asset management of Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreaction to financial market movements associated with apparently not the economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, in favour of an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to lower its interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited recognizable impact on growth in the US," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest rate fixing committee.</seg>
<seg id="44">Recent turmoil is not coming near that level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"She certainly doesn't want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rate increase because markets are getting upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think it should advance time.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS is trying, in a shocking way, to educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breast-feeding.</seg>
<seg id="3">Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.</seg>
<seg id="7">Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.</seg>

<seg id="1">Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle</seg>
<seg id="2">The local council Bernried approved the construction application for the €2.3 million sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="3">And he made an exception.</seg>
<seg id="4">The roof may be flat for solar systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">The plans for the long-awaited tower building at the Bernrieder Sportgrounds are progressing step by step: In the recent council meeting, the elaborated construction application was unanimously approved without major discussions.</seg>
<seg id="6">Previously, among other things, the panel had adopted a request for a construction "exception" to "respectful" exemption "from the valid bebaut plan.</seg>
<seg id="7">The "exception" concerned permission for a special form regarding roof construction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus, a "semi-roof with a non-attached first and attic" is to be built.</seg>
<seg id="9">Background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "This brings us together a wonderfully large south roof," Mayor Josef Steigenberger said at the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="10">The "liberation" was, in turn, about the attainment, which should be below 10 degrees for energy reasons, unlike the Bebauplan.</seg>
<seg id="11">This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.</seg>
<seg id="12">A "liberation" was needed because the balloon plan does not allow "exceptions" to the roof - with the Bernrieder local council usually more restrictive in the case of exemptions.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, Turnbull is not a recurring project: "We are not setting a precedent," says Steigenberger.</seg>
<seg id="14">Turnhallenbau am Sportzzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.</seg>
<seg id="15">Around EUR 2.3 million is calculated at a cost.</seg>
<seg id="16">Grants are expected from school and grassroots sports funding.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the next stage of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters hall will now be submitted to the county board for consideration.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau</seg>
<seg id="2">The Peißenberg hospital is expected to be closed earlier than planned - 2016.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new Medical Director at Schongau Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="4">The station and the majority of the staff move from Peißenberg to Schongau.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is what the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the Landkreis, the Councilman Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, a decision will be taken by the Supervisory Board and will be taken next Wednesday, 23 September.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the plans are implemented, all of the nearly 50 staff at Peißenberg hospital would be further employed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The vast majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the wider inside station.</seg>
<seg id="9">The rooms are there.</seg>
<seg id="10">The staff who cannot work with Schongau is to be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-White.</seg>
<seg id="11">Staff were informed about the plans.</seg>
<seg id="12">The change triggered the dismissal of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now switches to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the question of who is to enter the succession, according to Jochner-White, the name "fisherman" came into play who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and switch to Schongau with his team.</seg>
<seg id="14">For the house in Schongau, this in any case meant "appreciation" and a broadening of the offer in the field of internal medicine, according to Jochner-White.</seg>
<seg id="15">Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.</seg>
<seg id="16">Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the next two years, Fischer is expected to run both houses with his team if the Supervisory Board agrees to run both houses until next year's former hospital of the Knappie, which still has 35 beds, in Peißenberg after nearly 140 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">So far, the county had planned this for 2018 when the current clean-up at Weilheim hospital is completed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Landrätin Jochner-White, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, resigned rumours that the House, which is owned by the federal government, would in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I exclude that," as the property continues, Jochner-White couldn't say there are several considerations.</seg>
<seg id="21">There is currently a short-term care of Caritas and a daily psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="22">"What better couldn't happen to us, such an opportunity doesn't come again," Fischer said about the quasi-move to the lech, which had been received by the staff "positive and very understanding."</seg>
<seg id="23">There has been no real prospect for the house where fishermen have been working as chief doctor for over 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was asked by Schongauer's colleagues to take over the post of medical director.</seg>
<seg id="25">Peißenberg Hospital (once 100 beds) has been under constant threat of closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example, surgery and birth support.</seg>

<seg id="15">According to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="17">The study also makes significant failings in the housing policy of recent years.</seg>
<seg id="18">Germany is wrong with a housing deficit that will grow year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Currently around 770,000 units were missing in the population areas, Matthias Günther, author of the study, complains.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG rooms.</seg>
<seg id="21">Young adults remained involuntarily in the "Hotel Mama" because of the fuss in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="22">In large cities, the number of square metres per head has fallen again for the first time in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="23">To solve the problem, the Social Housing Alliance proposes a reboot.</seg>
<seg id="24">New incentives are expected to boost social housing.</seg>
<seg id="25">For example, the basic tax could be waived and the basic tax on subsidised housing could be suspended on a temporary basis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the alliance requires attractive tax deductions.</seg>
<seg id="27">The state bank KfW refugee programme is already well received by cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="28">A good week after the launch on Monday night, with 184 million euros, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been retrieved.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now the project could even be increased.</seg>

<seg id="1">Refugees have free time: Croatia and Slovenia launch corridor</seg>
<seg id="2">After Hungary there is virtually no more progress, as more and more refugees are choosing the way through Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Zagreb announces its intention to grant transit over Slovenia to the north without hurdles.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the route is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="5">Croatia wants to reach agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a refugee corridor.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have spoken to the Slovenian Home Secretary and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="8">The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to enter Western Europe from there.</seg>
<seg id="10">500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, Croatian television broadcaster RTL reports.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hungary closed its border for refugees on the previous day.</seg>
<seg id="12">New laws that came into force on the same day also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="13">Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.</seg>
<seg id="14">Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can go through and we are preparing for this possibility."</seg>
<seg id="15">These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, they are people who did not want to live in Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Croatian police picked up the first refugees on Serbia's border with Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="18">Most came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan, according to media reports.</seg>
<seg id="19">They arrived both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.</seg>
<seg id="20">Immediately after their arrival, they had tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="21">The refugees do not encounter border fences on the Croatian-Serbian border.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are other risks to this: There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="23">Mine cleaners are now expected to quickly create a safe passage.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, after Hungary closed the border, there are few more refugees.</seg>
<seg id="25">On Tuesday, police counted 366 recorded people.</seg>
<seg id="26">Shortly before Torture on Monday, it was still 9380.</seg>
<seg id="27">The new Hungarian laws constitute an offence to overcome and damage the border zone.</seg>
<seg id="28">35 criminal proceedings have therefore been initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="29">Convicts face jail sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the Immigration Department, a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones," of which almost all - 93 - were in the main transition.</seg>
<seg id="31">Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.</seg>
<seg id="32">There were 40 refugees there Wednesday morning.</seg>
<seg id="33">In practice, however, no one has any chance of obtaining asylum in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country."</seg>
<seg id="35">The rejected asylum seekers should be deported there.</seg>
<seg id="36">Only a few hundred refugees gathered before the "transit zone" in Röszke.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Röszke, workers started to clean up.</seg>
<seg id="38">They gathered the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="39">Locks were dismantled and one of the reception staff in the border area was rebuilt.</seg>
<seg id="40">No one wanted to comment on the aim of this restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="41">Austria still has few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="42">It has also strengthened its border controls.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, around 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government figures.</seg>
<seg id="44">In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">The train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the orders of German authorities.</seg>
<seg id="46">In open air, smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot.</seg>

<seg id="9">In total, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarterbacks this year.</seg>
<seg id="10">To meet the number, there are still 35,000 shelters to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries, 15,000 of the federal government.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald Trump's counterpart ancestors came from a place whose residents are called residents.</seg>
<seg id="3">This feature also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become US president.</seg>
<seg id="4">Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether it is xenophobic, it concerns journalists, or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US Presidential Office is actively stirring up the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="6">And does well.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is also registered in the pastoral Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the property billionaire come from.</seg>
<seg id="8">The New Yorker with the Föhnfrisur is a term for many in the Winzerdorf on the Wine Road.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some in the 1,200-inhabitant place is more than -zig corners with it.</seg>
<seg id="10">His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kallstadt-based Simone Wendel turned a film about Trump.</seg>
<seg id="12">And what do villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?</seg>
<seg id="13">"I think those find this somehow exciting, but are not so deeply impressed in their causal way," says Simone Wendel.</seg>
<seg id="14">The native Kallurbanist has shot an amusing documentary about the place and its famous explosions, which include, alongside Trump, the Ketchup family Heinz.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump, who is not known for modesty, is also speaking in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014), so with the statement that he would certainly succeed if he lived in Kallstadt.</seg>
<seg id="16">He did not bring it to the king of the hearts.</seg>
<seg id="17">While there is respect for the family's performance, Trump also tends to think that Trump is "already a bit of a big maul," Wendel says.</seg>
<seg id="18">Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the perimeter is "The Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsche: The Anders, she says.</seg>
<seg id="19">So Trump comes from the village of investors.</seg>
<seg id="20">Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a pub for gold graves in the US.</seg>
<seg id="21">The real estate group was founded in New York.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: Their desire to return to the home in the long term failed at the Bavarian state, which belonged to the Pfalz at the time.</seg>
<seg id="23">He did not include Trump because he was once without approval, the director of the Institute of Pole History and People's Party, Roland Paul, declared the film launch.</seg>
<seg id="24">Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigration."</seg>
<seg id="25">This contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of descendants.</seg>
<seg id="26">The had spoken repeatedly about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="27">"As the padded, this is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The Oma was a native Trump, the Opa was born Heinz").</seg>
<seg id="28">The winemaker in retirement looks more distanced to the Americans, "he's always so startling."</seg>
<seg id="29">Does he think Trump will come?</seg>
<seg id="30">"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="31">"He never got around Kallstadt."</seg>
<seg id="32">The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentioned, like some Kallstadter, that a descendent of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally good.</seg>
<seg id="33">"I can't imagine that from the Donald," the 68-year-old says.</seg>
<seg id="34">They are better off if he doesn't know the election, because "the one has such radical views, I don't know if that is good."</seg>
<seg id="35">If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the US had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."</seg>
<seg id="36">"There are more interesting issues than him," says winemaker Sarah Bühler.</seg>
<seg id="37">And as president?</seg>
<seg id="38">"My president isn't," she says.</seg>
<seg id="39">And: "The grapes are ripe even without President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="40">Wendel's film, for which Trump has long been interviewed, has seen 12,000 cinematographers, including in the US awakened interest.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mystery reveals?...</seg>
<seg id="3">Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly shown who wins The Bachelor.</seg>
<seg id="4">The woman, at whom Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor, was holed up in greatest secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="5">And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.</seg>
<seg id="6">But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before being out of three, you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed until the final on Thursday</seg>
<seg id="8">All three women have been left out lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should receive Woods last rose?" Their answers to the playoff could become who won the heart of the bachelor.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly - except themselves - called Mackay the best partner for Wood.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day.</seg>
<seg id="12">"From the moment I went to the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sams Energies, because I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the show," Jeavons-Fellows said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Sarah stands with both feet on Earth, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.</seg>
<seg id="14">I saw them together and they have the right chemistry.</seg>
<seg id="15">They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.</seg>
<seg id="17">From her point of view, Mackay said that last week's home visit made her clear that Wood could be "the one."</seg>
<seg id="18">"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now unreservedly hired on him," she said.</seg>
<seg id="19">And when asked who Wood should choose if not, she was puzzling.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't know if I can say that," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.</seg>
<seg id="2">Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open training day late last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some coaches would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game on the bench as he lost a scramble as the Aussie rugby league conversion did at his first point return on Tuesday in the 20-3 win against Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Tomsula trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a punt return and also into the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tomsula continued to show his real face in the dressing room after the game.</seg>
<seg id="7">Instead of grinding his rookies off the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tomsula also bolstered Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his patchy catch and take care of the next game.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jarryd Hayne patches at a punt restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter</seg>
<seg id="11">It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian entourage had hoped for his NFL debut.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hayne left the pitch after the fumble flustered and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,</seg>
<seg id="13">"This was a thing that happens now, you just care about the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hayne compared the carving with his Origin debut at the time in 2007, when a pass at his own in-Goal area led to a try for Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="15">Overall, it was nonetheless a great experience for the 27-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hayne posed for a photo with fans while holding an Australian flag after the game and poked it on his Instagram.</seg>

<seg id="1">Outdoors voters are demanding the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="2">Party and group chief executive Hubert Aiwanger warned at the start of the FW Autumn Clause in Grosswallstadt before a serious crisis at Bayerns schools if there are no corresponding new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse," Aiwanger said.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Otherwise we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system."</seg>
<seg id="4">The outdoor voter survey is scheduled to open until Friday in the underground commune.</seg>
<seg id="5">There were actually very different main issues.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the record number of refugees now dominates the free voter meeting.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Of course, the issue of asylum will overstore the clawing," Aiwanger said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, just as it existed during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="9">"So it doesn't go on, we have to get to the causes," the Free voter chief said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Rejected asylum seekers want to defer free voters as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why Aiwanger also required more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum actions: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The FW chief criticised the fact that several federal states were not consistent: "We needed uniform federal standards."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Bayern are shifting, others not."</seg>
<seg id="14">"There we need to be more effective."</seg>
<seg id="15">But national politics in Grosswallstadt should not fall under the table.</seg>
<seg id="16">A long-standing burner remains on the agenda: Education policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the new school year, Culture Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot "middle stage plus" at 47 gymnasies, where an extension of the gymnasial middle stage is tested from three to four years - as a result, it will take nine years to finish.</seg>
<seg id="18">But that doesn't go Aiwanger far enough.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The issue of G9 needs to be accelerated," the FW chief said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The violence erupted Tuesday night in the Rupanstreti district, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district official, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.</seg>
<seg id="5">MR Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.</seg>
<seg id="6">Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, known to be able to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.</seg>
<seg id="8">The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.</seg>
<seg id="9">There have also been protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who want their own state.</seg>

<seg id="1">For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.</seg>
<seg id="2">The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatments.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5">Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, obesity operations to treat type 2 diabetes have proved efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill-balanced with a body-mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach bypass and stomach flashes - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, BMI remained close to 29 among those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those undergoing surgical surgery, 36% of diabetes completely and 28% did so.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the medically-treated group, compared to this, diabetes completely broke only one percent and in part at just about two percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, the results in controls on blood pressure, triglyceride and the "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the 'surgical' group, the authors found.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hemmoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hämoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, researchers write.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the operation, the average Hämoglobin A1c level fell from about 9 per cent to around 6 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved Hämoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the fifth year, the Bypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the host recruiting group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved larger declines in the BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and Hämoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and more marked a complete elimination of the diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Swedish study, it was among obese people undergoing obesity surgery, about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the critical point of this study because it says this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think we wait too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that once they have collected these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Europe cannot accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees' home countries.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.</seg>
<seg id="5">He called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents under the circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also stressed that while Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis was admirable, the situation was not adequate.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to address the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions such as real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">We must reduce the use of force.</seg>

<seg id="14">After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to resolve this problem lies in non-violence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Four-fold increase in intake of suspended drugs by children over the past 4 years</seg>
<seg id="2">Toxic Control Centres in the US report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of revenue from hand disinfectants in children under the age of 12 who report poison control centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them are landing in the emergency," Lopez told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of a mutation among social media.</seg>
<seg id="6">Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.</seg>
<seg id="7">Young people reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing oral water to get a harder drink.</seg>
<seg id="8">Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.</seg>
<seg id="9">"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are disinfectant drugs with strawberry, grapes and orange fragrances that are very appealing to children.</seg>
<seg id="12">Suspended infections contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="13">Especially for infants, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Giftnotcall Center at the University of Kansas, told CNN 4 in Kansa City.</seg>
<seg id="15">So, you wouldn't let a sip of whisky around, but people leave this hand disinfectant within reach of children, and when children come to it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four syringes from after strawberry fragrant suspended infection at school, was taken into an emergency reception for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency medical doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nhaijah lent her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="19">Doctors monitored them overnight at a separate child's hospital on signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had encountered her head, Ritchey said.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="21">It could have been fatal for my child.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and store suspended infections outside the child's reach.</seg>
<seg id="23">Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were linked to deaths.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2013, two women died in Ontario women following the swallowing of suspended infection, which included a toxic, undeclared ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="25">Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was noted as an active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, three students of fourth grade in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by issuing antibacterial products around the classroom, "a police report reports.</seg>
<seg id="27">The teacher is highly allergic to suspended infection and served her out of her room.</seg>
<seg id="28">Police viewed the failed plan as a "garbage" and referred disciplinary action to the school authority.</seg>

<seg id="2">Griffiths plays down the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the Hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn that over again.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hearts will fight SFA for accusations of Neilson and Warburton being cautious in January's new commitments that could destroy the cadre's unity</seg>
<seg id="4">Dons raise lead over Celtic to five points</seg>
<seg id="5">Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a tight win over Hamilton in Pittodrie so the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.</seg>
<seg id="6">Griffiths plays down talk of disharmony</seg>
<seg id="7">There are rumours of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously dismissed by Griffiths, who insisted he and his team-mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch league leader.</seg>
<seg id="8">I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dutch - de Boer</seg>
<seg id="10">The former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they don't show highlights of the Celtic Games more and why?"</seg>
<seg id="12">It's because the Rangers are not there.</seg>
<seg id="13">People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.</seg>
<seg id="14">You talk about the Old Firm.</seg>
<seg id="15">They talk about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.</seg>
<seg id="16">There's a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and it's not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games.</seg>
<seg id="17">I'll turn things around, swears Deila.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ronny Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.</seg>
<seg id="19">After defeat to Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the defeat against 10-man from Aberdeen, who are now clear at the top of the table with five points ahead.</seg>
<seg id="20">But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll come back."</seg>
<seg id="21">Now we want to get out as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="22">I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.</seg>

<seg id="24">We really need, really the support of Celtic because that makes players better.</seg>
<seg id="25">Standing together is so important.</seg>
<seg id="26">Warburton cautious on January transfers</seg>
<seg id="27">Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was inciting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new entrants and insists he does not want to disrupt the unit of the Ibrox cadre.</seg>
<seg id="28">The ex-head of Brentford said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."</seg>
<seg id="29">The players who come in summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you've seen with our own group this season.</seg>
<seg id="30">The team is really good.</seg>
<seg id="31">Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.</seg>
<seg id="32">Celtic target man Michu with withdrawal card</seg>
<seg id="33">Swansea striker Michu, with Celtic in conversation during the transfer period, has indicated he can withdraw if his contract expires at the Swans.</seg>

<seg id="35">Hearts on SFA battle set for Neilson's comments</seg>
<seg id="36">The Hearts led 2: 1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3: 2, but the defense's red card was later lifted - Collum's third red card, which was revoked in eight months.</seg>
<seg id="37">Neilson remains at what he said, insisting: "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on any performance."</seg>
<seg id="38">Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle</seg>
<seg id="39">The impromptu Hibee was denied after admitting to having sung a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.</seg>
<seg id="40">The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "It's safe to say that I don't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."</seg>
<seg id="42">Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee United management</seg>
<seg id="43">Simon Donnelly insists Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits the decline must end on the pitch.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why I will witness an execution in Oklahoma</seg>
<seg id="2">A little later today, except for late legal intervention, I will see a man being brought to death.</seg>
<seg id="3">If it happens and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a spectator's gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison injection.</seg>
<seg id="4">He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.</seg>
<seg id="5">The invitation was first made in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the day moved closer, I began to fear.</seg>
<seg id="7">So why should I do it?</seg>
<seg id="8">I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="9">It would provide a unique perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since more applications are often available as places, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.</seg>
<seg id="12">Whoever is selected will watch it emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="13">I can't.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will sit next to Richard Glossips's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.</seg>
<seg id="15">I like the guy.</seg>
<seg id="16">We often laugh a lot when we speak.</seg>
<seg id="17">Prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.</seg>
<seg id="18">I just have to try to remember all the details.</seg>
<seg id="19">A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="20">Here's the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tell the detainee's story how he wants it, and you get access.</seg>
<seg id="22">I complain to her.</seg>
<seg id="23">She acknowledged that she "could have formulated it better," but she still thinks it's wrong, which I do.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things I said and wrote.</seg>
<seg id="25">He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.</seg>
<seg id="26">I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he wants an international reporter present to write there.</seg>
<seg id="28">If he dies, he thinks outreach will help the movement against the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.</seg>
<seg id="31">I do not want to go back to all the details.</seg>
<seg id="32">I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I believe there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I certainly believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="36">I think his execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And from that perspective I'll see him die.</seg>
<seg id="38">I cannot claim to be truly objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">There will be other reporters you can turn to.</seg>
<seg id="40">What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.</seg>

<seg id="1">Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing</seg>
<seg id="2">Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.</seg>
<seg id="3">He targeted the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried through a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had withheld 18 months because of the spy allegations and did not want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I had to say nothing about it and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.</seg>
<seg id="7">You know it went on.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said.</seg>
<seg id="9">I'll go home tonight and sleep well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I want to go around elevated principal and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.</seg>
<seg id="11">If they start thinking I don't do that, I shouldn't be coaches anymore.</seg>
<seg id="12">I then have to consider what I do with my license.</seg>
<seg id="13">Previously, Moody had ramped up the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I'm asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to deliver information about what I'm doing within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.</seg>
<seg id="15">They apparently believe I'm a fraudster.</seg>
<seg id="16">If that's the case, they should certainly get to their noses because they failed in trying to catch me.</seg>
<seg id="17">Robert Roulston, Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President-in-Office of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.</seg>
<seg id="18">Should that make me think that it will be personal?</seg>
<seg id="19">Did the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps make people outside trainers responsible for what is happening in the industry?</seg>
<seg id="20">Am I bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="21">Am I so bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="22">Maybe people out there think I'm.</seg>
<seg id="23">Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying is letting them think about it now.</seg>
<seg id="24">But I have now reached the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.</seg>
<seg id="25">That makes me really sad.</seg>
<seg id="26">I will put the pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">I have the support of my family and I can go.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trainer's frustrating levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led him to say he could "throw his license over the table."</seg>
<seg id="29">Moody, best known by his preparation of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It's against the rules of racing.</seg>
<seg id="31">I have to take full responsibility for that, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">"One of my staff mistakenly applied mud to the leg.</seg>
<seg id="33">It could have been like that last night.</seg>
<seg id="34">It could have been all day yesterday, whatever it was.</seg>
<seg id="35">It also had it on race day.</seg>
<seg id="36">Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day, an investigation into the matter opened.</seg>
<seg id="37">It's a joke.</seg>
<seg id="38">People who set these rules know nothing about the horse.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all see that we need rules, but here you've gone too far," Moody said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes down rivals for claims to ring fights</seg>
<seg id="2">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of the Tackling of his players as "agenda setting" of two Premier League favourites of the NRL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled comment to the Storm team after his team scored the final-round victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "sample example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too" in the wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy defended his team's tacklimg and said they were focused only on their "contact" at Tackling.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches at his team would give him confidence as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is recurring - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fighting when they beaten us 24: 2," Bellamy said Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that we have not changed anything to our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Taccles a real focus, and that has provided us with the turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he is probably not accustomed to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's funny how this happens again and again at this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of "thrilling football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne talks about exciting football.</seg>
<seg id="13">He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was, "Bellamy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he will take care of it.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's the ball game you want to play if you have those kind of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made that statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like these.</seg>
<seg id="18">I build more confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about having to play against us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it came to the Big Games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm scored a higher score against Roosters than the game Broncos scored against Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Broncos' game was probably a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game was 20: 18, there were two more tries in our game, but is this an exciting game?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or are breaks made and no points somewhat tense?</seg>
<seg id="24">For me, it's the game plans.</seg>
<seg id="25">When they mention us, it means we will still meet them at a stage.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storm team has been free this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the preliminary finals at AAMI Park.</seg>

<seg id="2">A man who may face life sentence for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released on a bail of $200,000.</seg>
<seg id="3">Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and arrived in Coomera in August.</seg>
<seg id="4">Maksimovic was watched as he met his co-defendants in the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite a possible life sentence for trying to own a commercial crowd of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence he was trying to own the whole crowd and that in the cafe for a harmless reason.</seg>
<seg id="6">The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.</seg>
<seg id="7">He has clear relations with Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="8">He often travels to Serbia, "he told the court Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the criminal case, he lied to police about his whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a bail of $200,000 as a security together to achieve his release.</seg>
<seg id="11">"After reading the ironclad statements of the two people, it is clear that the requirement of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," Judge Flanagan said.</seg>
<seg id="12">But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing, he warned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Maksimovic was released on bail under the terms that he gives off his Australian and Serbian passport, reports to police daily and sticks to a curfew from 18: 00-06: 00.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stevan Hogg used phone from girls to lure paedophiles to send pictures</seg>
<seg id="2">A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when this slept, logging into an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.</seg>
<seg id="4">The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.</seg>
<seg id="5">She saw it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police took care of this and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "related" web searches that used terms for searching indecent images of children.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hogg then claimed to officials that he did so, since it would lead to "paedophiles on the Internet" and he then "pretended to be a policeman to scare them."</seg>
<seg id="8">Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a addiction - that he was addicted to frightening people.</seg>
<seg id="9">He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophiles.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send even more photos.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said he did it to lure them.</seg>
<seg id="12">He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking, and said he then wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on the trek and on the wine.</seg>
<seg id="14">She then also saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the defendant.</seg>
<seg id="15">The girl was interviewed and said the defendant used computers and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment to have included indecent images of children on June 14 last year, violating the conditions on January 25 this year and not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" should be found in his offense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hogg was granted bail in that case but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.</seg>
<seg id="20">He was added to the register of sexual offenders before the date of judgment.</seg>

<seg id="3">Many smugglers left people more at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest</seg>
<seg id="4">Out on the Austrian side, a spokesman for the federal police said.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the border river Inn in Passau and Rottal Inn since Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">They had reached the German side on foot via bridges and dams.</seg>
<seg id="7">There they are received by federal police and forwarded for registration.</seg>
<seg id="8">At Munich's main railway station, more refugees arrived again, according to federal police data, compared to Wednesday's start.</seg>
<seg id="9">About 700 people arrived in the state capital by 8.00 a.m. alone, a spokesman said in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="10">After reintroducing controls on the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees reached the city on Tuesday.</seg>

<seg id="1">The crowd makes it: Every two years, the automakers on the IAA show their novelties.</seg>
<seg id="2">In 2015, the compact cars, which are selling particularly well at the moment, are particularly active.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand: About 28.1 percent of new registrations accounted for this segment in August alone, according to Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="4">This is also reflected on the IAA (audience days 17 to 27 September).</seg>
<seg id="5">Many new compact models are presented between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new upper class and luxury cars this year.</seg>
<seg id="6">One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is Opel Astra, which will be at retailers in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Astra is an extremely important model for us," Opel chief Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the fair.</seg>
<seg id="8">It belongs to the core of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order to sell the volume model well, the new Astra will not be much more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="10">Opel represents a entry below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.</seg>
<seg id="11">The current Astra costs from €16 990.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Astra has a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW / 100 PS.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, the halves offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW / 95 PS to 147 kW / / / 200 PS, including three-cylinder petrol.</seg>
<seg id="14">Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a fifth.</seg>
<seg id="15">The second version will follow in the spring of the Combi, which can be seen on the IAA.</seg>
<seg id="16">And what's going to happen next to the Astra on the IAA?</seg>
<seg id="17">Renault Mégane: Renault is launching the fourth generation of its Astra rival Mégane.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the fair, the Mégane can be seen exclusively as a five-belt in a conventional and a stressed sporting GT version.</seg>
<seg id="19">He comes into the trade early next year, then as a combi.</seg>
<seg id="20">Infiniti: Completely new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment with the new model.</seg>
<seg id="22">The compact Infiniti fits fully into the brand's design line with its curved lines.</seg>
<seg id="23">The base model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 horsepower.</seg>
<seg id="24">On offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp.</seg>
<seg id="25">Suzuki Baleno: New to the segment is Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="26">The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbocharger and an output of 82 kW / 111 PS.</seg>
<seg id="27">The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm).</seg>
<seg id="28">The launch of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.</seg>
<seg id="29">DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact PXI DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën Ableger placed their hand on the front part: Here the cooler grill was redrawn and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen and first integrated Apple's CarPlay.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, on the IAA in the compact class, a number of overhauls and new variants such as the freshened Mercedes A-class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Federal Constitutional Court has given right to an ex-detainee of Justice Tegel, who was housed in one too small cell for months.</seg>
<seg id="3">Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation when housed in too small cells.</seg>
<seg id="4">That was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision released Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the judges, those affected can hope for money even if they were locked in too narrow rooms only a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).</seg>
<seg id="6">In this way, an ex-detainee was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was housed in a single cell with around five square feet of floor space in the Justice Department of Berlin-Tegel between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated from space.</seg>
<seg id="7">After that, the man, who is now at large again, according to his lawyer, had been moved to a larger cell.</seg>
<seg id="8">His arrest was breached because of the indecent conditions of imprisonment against the Land of Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the Constitutional Court lifted the ruling of the Chamber Court of Berlin and dismissed the case for re-examination.</seg>
<seg id="10">They see the man's human dignity violated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chamber Court now decides on the level of compensation</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of liability for compensation are valid from the period in question, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Otherwise, "a mutilation of the legal protection of personality" would be to be feared.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chamber Court must now clarify the level of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.</seg>
<seg id="16">So they only spoke to a detainee in April for damages because he was naked in a cell.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without separate toilet is also inhumane.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which in a parallel case in November 2009 certified a decent accommodation for a prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="19">The then plaintiff was housed over three months a day between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karlovy Vary case.</seg>
<seg id="20">Berlin prisons have also been in the headlines in recent weeks because of a lack of staff.</seg>
<seg id="21">Prisoners are therefore always included for 23 hours, aggressiveness is rising, even to thugs, because of the tense situation.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to the Justice Department, 21 posts in Tegel are not filled for lack of progress and 19 are to be dropped in 2016.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angela Merkel and Refugee Policy: "We create this"</seg>
<seg id="2">Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.</seg>
<seg id="3">What happens to Germany?</seg>
<seg id="4">Some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accommodate one million refugees.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can create that and we create it."</seg>
<seg id="6">The following overview is given to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to different forecasts, between 350,000 (the Federal Ministry of Agriculture's estimate) and 400,000 (the Pestel Institute's estimate) homes are needed annually - the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is almost twice as much as is being built so far (250,000 homes).</seg>
<seg id="9">The lack of housing, however, is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: 60 000 to 80 000 social housing each year will be excluded from rental price fixing and refugees will apply for these particularly favourable housing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Federal Minister for Agriculture Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from 518 million currently to one billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="11">Far too little is this from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing would have to be created every year and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion per year in this respect.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Institute for Employment and Vocational Research estimates that 55% of poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them enter, criticising Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Work is the key to social contacts, for appreciation in the reception society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political change: From the ban on the work of refugees to the recognition of work.</seg>
<seg id="18">While there used to be a ban on the employment of asylum seekers of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence requirement, which limits asylum seekers to a place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="19">In society, a majority of people, including the shortage of skilled workers, have taken the view that refugees should be given access to the labour market more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="20">A major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="21">There has not yet been a sufficient range of general and professional language courses.</seg>
<seg id="22">Research also shows that jobs are most often taught through personal contacts.</seg>
<seg id="23">The creation of networks is therefore, in the view of Thränhardt, the premier route to labour integration.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Berlin School Administration has found that few fled parents give their children to the Kitas, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it's only very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.</seg>
<seg id="25">To convince the family of the benefits of Kita, the administration distributes paperwork in different languages.</seg>
<seg id="26">Should the need for educators rise sharply by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - by allowing more specialist schools.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the countries, students without knowledge of German will be prepared for the lessons.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but also, as in Berlin, by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration.</seg>
<seg id="30">The German student works estimate that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patient studies - the only exception so far was Berlin, interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his stance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Student-assisted refugees could be facilitated access to college.</seg>
<seg id="33">Because refugees with a residency allowance or dulling no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Protection Act when they start studying.</seg>
<seg id="34">The latter do not receive a Bafög in principle, since they do not fall under the circle of the bafiosity.</seg>
<seg id="35">Patient refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for Bafög, from 1 January 2016, this margin is reduced to 15 months.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, this funding gap must also be closed, demanding Steffen Krach, Berlin's Secretary of State for Science, and the German Student Works Agency.</seg>
<seg id="37">Students should get Bafög immediately.</seg>
<seg id="38">Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The state should give Islam the same rights as the churches, and develop the existing state church law into a new state-religious relationship.</seg>
<seg id="40">It would also be important to set up an Islamic Welfare Association, which deals professionally with the newcomers.</seg>
<seg id="41">Rights also include duties.</seg>
<seg id="42">For example, Islam's representatives must agree on clear contact points and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give it some control.</seg>
<seg id="43">This includes a willingness to take heed of religious fundamentalism.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">Those who wanted to overcome such conflicts in Germany "immediately have their right to stay here, in Germany," he said on Bayran radio.</seg>
<seg id="46">He suggested translating the basic law to Arabic.</seg>
<seg id="47">Integration will be much more than it is today.</seg>
<seg id="48">This will also have to change the majority society, reducing discrimination and racism will become more pressing.</seg>
<seg id="49">Germany, as a result of European decisions, has for a short decade an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.</seg>
<seg id="51">Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have been demanding for a long time, and what international agreements such as the anti-racism convention impose on Germany, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens' opportunities - for the benefit of all.</seg>
<seg id="52">In general, Germany is able to provide medical assistance to the refugees expected to date, according to medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="53">"As far as man- power and capacity is concerned, we are creating that," he told the daytime crowd.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, additional money has to go into the system.</seg>
<seg id="55">To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery is asking all residents to hand out health cards immediately when registering.</seg>
<seg id="56">Services delivered could later be settled with the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="57">And, in the long term, it is highly questionable to divide so many people with the limited range of services provided by the Asylum Protection Agency Act.</seg>
<seg id="58">Otherwise, doctors mainly make language barriers.</seg>
<seg id="59">So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated, migrants are getting worse informed about their illnesses than other patients.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is not only in clinics, but also in medical practice that interpretation costs should be borne out.</seg>
<seg id="61">But it would also help many refugees with more general medical contact points in emergency ambulances.</seg>
<seg id="62">And with another diagnostic look.</seg>
<seg id="63">Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned about HIV education.</seg>
<seg id="64">However, German doctors, in some cases other than those in the disease, are clearly aware of their training, according to Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="65">"Parasites or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect," and as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned, refugees may even see relief in sight.</seg>
<seg id="66">The Syrians have a highly developed education system, and many refugees are even doctors.</seg>
<seg id="67">In order to be able to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and perhaps carry out checks again.</seg>
<seg id="68">At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to the Federal Psychiatric Therapy Council (BPtK) estimates: Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.</seg>
<seg id="69">Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK.</seg>
<seg id="70">A recent study by TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children are traumatised in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="71">Those who are ill with post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from, among other things, so-called flashbacks with breathing, dizziness, heart rases and death fears.</seg>
<seg id="72">Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong horror and emotional deafness.</seg>
<seg id="73">To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.</seg>
<seg id="74">So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="75">Although psychologically ill asylum seekers in social offices can apply for psychotherapy, the treatment usually takes several months.</seg>
<seg id="76">In addition, in the social departments, most of the staff or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="77">This often leads to misassessments, says Munz.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mansions invite you to dream</seg>
<seg id="2">With the new "passion" staging, the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.</seg>
<seg id="3">The goal is to draw every age group into the band of fascinating acrobatics, animal dresses and one-time entertainment.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream into the mansions on the brick wall.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Our passion is circus."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, Tierlehrer and Juniorchefin.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Passion" - under this motto is current maneuvering.</seg>
<seg id="8">For more than 33 years the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.</seg>
<seg id="9">The gift to inspire the family is therefore in blood.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's important to us to get people away from their everyday stream and get them involved in a completely different world for two hours," stresses the 27-year-old junior.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Mane cocktail with world-class flair," Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.</seg>
<seg id="12">50 cities on the nearly 3,000 km tour can now experience this flair.</seg>
<seg id="13">The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with joke and charm.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.</seg>
<seg id="16">With the heroes of silent films, it wants to loosely record the Cuban duo.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ease and agility - with these words they identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="18">Her humorous art at the Mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.</seg>
<seg id="19">Apart from numerous salmon salves, Circus Probst's acrobatics also fascinates with fingertips and joints.</seg>
<seg id="20">Balancing with one wheel on a ball?</seg>
<seg id="21">For He Yuan no problem.</seg>
<seg id="22">Snake menus fascinate and scare at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wang Lin of China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinated with its agility.</seg>
<seg id="24">60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The animals belong to our family," notes Stephanies's mother, Brigitte Probst.</seg>
<seg id="26">Abuses in circadian attitudes are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.</seg>
<seg id="27">Stephanie Probst also takes a position on this: "Don't do our animals well, don't do us well either."</seg>
<seg id="28">About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.</seg>
<seg id="29">The "four-legged artistes," as they are lovingly called, will be expelled from the eyes if possible.</seg>
<seg id="30">We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the animal doesn't feel comfortable, it doesn't want to go into the mansions either.</seg>
<seg id="32">So the supreme imperative: Good for the animals.</seg>
<seg id="33">Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland ponydog and a zebrastute, the Probst family is proud.</seg>
<seg id="34">The two animals have lived together eight years in a walking room and nothing has happened.</seg>
<seg id="35">"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," Brigitte told Probst.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Zebroid is not yet ready for the mansions, but it is the unique mascot of Circus Probst.</seg>
<seg id="37">So for every visitor, something should be there.</seg>
<seg id="38">"One thing is safe," Stephanie Probst says: "No matter if five or 1 200 viewers, we always give our best and are with full heart."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Circus Probst invites you to its performances from 17 to 20 September every day.</seg>
<seg id="40">On Sunday, the program begins at 11 a.m. and 16 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thursday is family day, for the show at 5 p.m., prices are reduced.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is also a daily pool open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="2">MR Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell from a podium down the stairs earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="3">He remained uninjured, but video of the case spread quickly through the social media.</seg>
<seg id="4">The opening of parliament was also clouded by allegations by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mugabe's address with a book.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last month they busted him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their cell phones, which they warned would disrupt Mr. Mugabe's address.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">It warns the MPs concerned that immunity will end in parliament, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.</seg>
<seg id="9">The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.</seg>

<seg id="1">FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must be behind injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">This optimistic scenario already means Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his involvement in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The big shame on this current problem is that Wilshere had finished strongly last season after a separate ankle injury and then found back to his old swing during pre-season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This kind of injury doesn't threaten the career," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's a bone that didn't heal well.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is not a major matter.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was just an accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not related to his ankles or to the injuries he had before.</seg>
<seg id="10">This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but, as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.</seg>
<seg id="11">It also develops an unpleasant pattern.</seg>
<seg id="12">The inquiry into Premier Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different illnesses from Wilshere since its debut six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">He also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five games.</seg>
<seg id="14">The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe an improvement in the injury rate will continue during last season.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes, when you come back from injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat power," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough to overcome that.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arsenal begin their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the Games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger faces a rotation within the team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger can also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a small breather," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although Arsenal are clear favourites to move forward through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most intimidating venues in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dynamo is also undefeated after 41 games after the "unbeaten" campaign started last season.</seg>
<seg id="25">The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, with 3.2 measured on the Richter scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">This year it was 10th in Zagreb.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger believes Arsenal have drawn the lesson from last season's Champions League surrender against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This drive is immense," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has never folded at Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="30">We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">FriendsFest: The comedy show giving us serious lessons about men's friendships</seg>
<seg id="2">The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year high.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it was the main cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common among men than among women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an effort to tackle the problem, the Campaign announced Against Living Miserable (CALM - campaign against a pathetic life) in 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study by more than 2,000 high school students with depressed symptoms found that if the suffering had a enough high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery doubled.</seg>
<seg id="7">For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the risks of mental problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the age of social media-led communication, with its focus on style about substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsically values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="12">And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy luck.</seg>
<seg id="13">The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was put on its head.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shines through interaction as a friend.</seg>
<seg id="15">The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments at football gusts in cosy armchairs and the yearning of Ross to Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it, even if they often hold back, fully explore their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As one member of the telephone crew explained to me,... "my audience role for people who feel depressed and are suicidal has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old saying "I'm right to say" has a huge impact, like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems openly. "</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term redress mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">It clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.</seg>
<seg id="21">So much my objective outsider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so when you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know what difference your friendship could make.</seg>
<seg id="25">Friends are sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest</seg>

<seg id="1">Di Maria meets to help PSG dismantle Malmö</seg>
<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="3">Di Maria meets in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG preach to Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at Prinzenpark Stadium on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria hit less than four minutes after starting his Champions League debut as a PSG player who launched the French champions, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally raising their lead when Cavani scored a headball in the 61st minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions as they aim not only for qualifying for the K.o.laps but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, while they had the points, it was not a small game of Laurent Blancs's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances before the goal, he was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career as early as 1999.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League... so it's a good start to win 2-0, cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things we still have to perfect over the course of the season," Blanc said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is a good sign.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and we won, although I regret we didn't score one or two more goals. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Ibrahimovic returned after being injured in one of three changes to the Paris team, which could hold a 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in the First League at the weekend, but he was stripped out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentine wing striker was described as the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why when he ran into Marco Verrattis's pass behind the Malmö defence before walking past Johan Wiland beautifully into the corner of the net.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, if anyone believed PSG would score a big win, that was disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach that stage, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the midfield upset a heavy opponent.</seg>
<seg id="16">But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far past Kevin Trapps posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some mishaps and poor qualifications, not least from Ibrahimovic, who patched at no less than five tries in the first half alone and then abandoned it after Cavani used it after the restart.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even so, he did much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria turned into a shot that was diverted from Wiland in the 52nd minute...</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal finally fell just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic fished a left flank from Maxwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">That ended all the thought that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz, could keep the final result low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi recognized a goal at the end.</seg>
<seg id="21">The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then we've only played in the Swedish league, which doesn't have the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The skills games are not enough. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Hat ab vor Paris!</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a great game of them!</seg>

<seg id="2">The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which is affected by falling commodity prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt-to-GDP plan.</seg>
<seg id="3">London-based Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.</seg>
<seg id="4">The company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China's economic downturn squeezes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.</seg>
<seg id="5">The issuance of reference rights brought Glencore's share price at trading early Wednesday morning a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.</seg>
<seg id="7">Glencore last week announced the $2.5 billion share sale as part of broader plans to pay off about a third of its $30 billion debt.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company sold the new holdings to 125 pence per share, which represented a 2.4-percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Concerns about long-term constrained growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="1">Xavi: PEP Guardiola prevented 2008 move to FC Bayern</seg>
<seg id="2">World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015</seg>
<seg id="3">FC Bayern were obviously close to the commitment of Spain's superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.</seg>
<seg id="4">Eight times Spanish champions, three times postseason winners, four times Champions League winners, two times club champions, two times European champions, one time world champions - Xavi's title list is staggering.</seg>
<seg id="5">In summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already ahead of Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="7">"You told me that Barça wanted to sell me."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Madrid won everything at the time, we nothing," he told me.</seg>
<seg id="9">And that also registered FC Bayern.</seg>
<seg id="10">Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Rummenigge wanted me to have."</seg>
<seg id="12">As a reminder, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern in the summer of 2008.</seg>
<seg id="13">Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change</seg>
<seg id="14">However, the change did not materialise.</seg>
<seg id="15">And today the decisive man works for the German record master: PEP Guardiola.</seg>
<seg id="16">Xavi explains why: "Barça got Guardiola under contract and I played a great EM."</seg>
<seg id="17">"PEP told me that I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."</seg>
<seg id="18">"With that, he cried me."</seg>
<seg id="19">Who knows how Bayerns would have run Xavi's 2008 / 2009 season.</seg>
<seg id="20">Xavi stood for Barca in the quarterfinals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the turf, switched the Red forward (4: 0, 1: 1) and celebrated at the end of the premier triumph.</seg>

<seg id="2">Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not required behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a episode of Sunday Night of HBOs Project GreenLight, experienced actor Brown broke down when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives, referring to a black protagonists in the project's chosen script.</seg>
<seg id="4">"When we talk about diversity, you do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show," Damon assured.</seg>
<seg id="5">Brown reacted shocked, with insulting disbelief and called "Hoo! WoW." Okay, "when The Martian's comments rallied.</seg>
<seg id="6">Damon and Brown joined producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I want to ask people to think about it - whoever the director will be - how they treat the figure of Harmony," Brown said initially.</seg>
<seg id="8">The only black person, and she is a nutty beaten by her white pimp.</seg>
<seg id="9">The producer of Dear White People campaigned for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for directing rights to the film; Damon replied that her directing "at the end could give us something we don't want."</seg>
<seg id="10">After the discussion aired, the social media exploded from disapproval of Damon's comments.</seg>
<seg id="11">Twitter user Mr Pooni crushed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's SO WEISS that hurts it."</seg>
<seg id="12">The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 Likes since its release.</seg>
<seg id="13">Damon's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the grand prize of $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="3">The competition show, which just closed its 7th season, had never seen a competition participant complete all stages of its obstacle course.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, managed to reach the final.</seg>
<seg id="5">The last task was to climb a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="6">Britten finished the task within time, making him the first athlete to complete the exhausting Phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished that challenge full three seconds faster, making him the winner.</seg>
<seg id="7">Caldiero spoke with E! News after the hard-won win, still under shock over winning the Grand Prix of $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," Isaac E said! About his pile of money.</seg>
<seg id="9">So suddenly.. as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="10">Leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he first finished the course, won't get any prize money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Under the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.</seg>
<seg id="13">How much money is a wonderful price and changes life, it gets the great congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think he has any grudge about it.</seg>
<seg id="15">He's just so happy to have done what he did.</seg>
<seg id="16">He received crowds of awards from fans.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's such a great guy and a family friend.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is a hero to his children and his wife.</seg>
<seg id="19">Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."</seg>
<seg id="20">And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had swapped the roles.</seg>

<seg id="1">Detroit Tigers grind past Minnesota Twins</seg>
<seg id="2">MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.</seg>
<seg id="3">They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played that part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 at Target Field.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Twins wasted a chance to climb within a playoff of the Houston Astros for second American League wild-card place.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Detroit, though only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word, which was so difficult to capture over much of the second half of the season.</seg>
<seg id="7">"All the victories are fun, no matter how it comes," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Simon (13-9) struck out 6 times in the 1 / 3 innings and allowed three Runs.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I want to finish strongly this year," Simon said.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's hard to throw in the bullpen every game and so I want to go into the game quite focused.</seg>
<seg id="13">The designated Tigers hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two Runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He did the stroke well," Ausmus said.</seg>
<seg id="16">He looked good at the (stroke training), looked significantly better off in the bullpen, and he brought it straight into the game.</seg>
<seg id="17">With three Runs in the back of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.</seg>
<seg id="18">Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the Inning with a double on the left field line.</seg>
<seg id="19">Right fielder Aaron Hicks hit a bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.</seg>
<seg id="20">Hardy overran Wall, the only man he faced, before presumptive rookie batter Miguel Sano, who tore off right-hander Drew Verhagen a Two-Run.</seg>
<seg id="21">With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a Double Play.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was this in Major League leading 27th time this season that Plouffe beat a Double Play</seg>
<seg id="23">After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth innings, Wall created an RBI double against the Closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and scored the stand of 5-4.</seg>
<seg id="24">The right-hander, however, stole Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.</seg>
<seg id="25">Detroit benefited to kick-start the game from an unmoving Phil Hughes.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Tigers scored three Runs in the first two innings against the right-hander veteran, who had been removed from the injury list before the game after missing for more than a month because of a backhand.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Obviously not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."</seg>
<seg id="28">After getting the lead-off batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.</seg>
<seg id="29">A Two-Out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, creating a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.</seg>
<seg id="30">Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in scoring position.</seg>
<seg id="31">Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to third, ending the threat.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Tigers put in the second, scoring a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a Two-Out single from center-fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="33">"This was a big blow," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.</seg>
<seg id="34">He didn't score particularly well, but he caught the right spot.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by reliever right-hander A.J.Achter.</seg>
<seg id="36">At Hughes, there were three Runs at six hits and a Walk with four strikeouts.</seg>
<seg id="37">Notes: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez retired because of injury to the throwing shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="38">He is being investigated by Dr James Andrews, who operated Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="39">Sanchez, on the injury list since mid-August because of a shoulder strain, is expected to be activated for the start Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="40">With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is scrapped from the injury list to start against the Twins.</seg>
<seg id="41">Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30</seg>
<seg id="42">He has been missing since August 20 because of a crush in the right hip.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday</seg>
<seg id="44">Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)</seg>

<seg id="4">Germany also did not return refugees to Austria.</seg>
<seg id="5">"No, that's so agreed," she explained.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the question of an agreement under which Germany could host a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been discussions on this between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">She did not mention specific figures and pointed to talks Wednesday in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="8">In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their goal is mostly Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders, requested a special summit next week.</seg>
<seg id="11">Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="12">EU countries have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="13">EU Home Affairs Ministers intend to take a new approach to the mandatory distribution of a further 120 000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September).</seg>
<seg id="14">In view of the strong refugee vessel in Germany, the federal government wants to give more support to countries in the initial reception and distribution of people.</seg>
<seg id="15">The federal government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday night after almost four-month consultations with the prime ministers at the chancellor's office in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="16">Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection also complained.</seg>
<seg id="17">But those who do not have a lead perspective cannot remain in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="18">This view was strongly shared in the round.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "huge effort."</seg>
<seg id="20">Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans route.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="22">A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania would also disappear with a fence.</seg>
<seg id="23">This neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU.</seg>
<seg id="24">Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from seeking escape routes over Romania, Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on the planned new border fence.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.</seg>
<seg id="26">There were initial arrests of people who had average the fence.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Turkey, meanwhile, eyewitness reports showed thousands more migrants heading to the Greek border.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.</seg>

<seg id="4">Because mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially Saccharose.</seg>

<seg id="7">When buying Mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="8">The shaft color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious.</seg>
<seg id="9">They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within days.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, of course, they taste pure or sweet food.</seg>

<seg id="2">Just over 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless place in the park on the Oppio Hill was baptized on the name of the German reformist.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Piazza Martin Lutero, he is now recognized as a German theologian of Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="5">The park is located in the middle of old Rome next to the Coliseum.</seg>
<seg id="6">The name was requested by the working community of evangelical churches in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of popes over centuries as a minority could often live only in secret.</seg>
<seg id="8">The place symbolises the fact that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible</seg>
<seg id="2">Jesus with the (gilded) village crone is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.</seg>
<seg id="3">Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the beginning was the word?</seg>
<seg id="5">No, not at the Otmar-Alt Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.</seg>
<seg id="7">His "language" with colorful colours and imaginative shapes has been preserved by the 75-year-old - which is by no means synonymous with "funny" images.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the contrary, it can be quite bleak to adapt to the issues concerned.</seg>
<seg id="9">About three years Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many themes of the book of all books.</seg>
<seg id="10">Cycles have emerged that address issues such as crossroads, pads, bids or fatherhood.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.</seg>
<seg id="12">And here is the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible points on the basis of the painting.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has interpreted the books selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into current contexts.</seg>
<seg id="14">These lyrics are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are embedded between the original Bible citation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist, who formulates his own personal thoughts about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The jewelry band has golden letters.</seg>
<seg id="17">So the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is a high level of intimacy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler Order.</seg>
<seg id="20">"This is where education happened with the cane," Otmar Alt recalls.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I tried to work that up to maybe wear myself back with the Lord Father."</seg>
<seg id="22">His second concern is to give more prominence to art in a fast-paced period: "The perception of images today is characterized by reclamation, and that is loud.</seg>
<seg id="23">Symbolism is being pushed out.</seg>
<seg id="24">Artists have a different desire and Wonne to show things.</seg>
<seg id="25">Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In this respect, I'm a dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="27">Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into the pictures," let them work, discover and feel what power they have: "The image seeks its counterpart."</seg>
<seg id="28">Klaus Altepost acknowledged Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Foundation, "always" a lover of Otmar Alts art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."</seg>
<seg id="29">Old did not pay attention to fully capturing the Bible, but selected the issues important to him, including mysterious ones.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This was not a collaboration on an equal footing," Altepost says: "This is about the images, the text only explained," a picture Bible emerged.</seg>
<seg id="31">For Hans Möhler of the Luther publishing house, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."</seg>
<seg id="32">Otmar Alts pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="33">Part of the original - paper and quality images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on 15 November at the Otmar-Alt-Foundation.</seg>

<seg id="2">The DFB expands its commitment to refugees by 2019, the Bundesliga is sending a clear signal at the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="3">Football is responding to the worsening situation in Germany and ensures that the policy will help to address the challenges ahead.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I consider this to be our country's biggest challenge since reunification."</seg>
<seg id="5">"There, in principle, no one can say this is not about me, I have nothing to do with it."</seg>
<seg id="6">"This has to be of interest to each individual to get this issue under control," DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach said.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany in depth.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I am in the chancellor's office next Wednesday and meet the state minister Ms Özoğuz and the Chancellor there."</seg>
<seg id="9">"There will certainly be a central role to play," he announced.</seg>
<seg id="10">Football can and will help.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, the crucial points must be the policy.</seg>
<seg id="12">The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1-0 for a welcome" by four years.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019," said Niersbach, on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's / Malta.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some federal experts also support this program.</seg>
<seg id="15">As early as this weekend, the 36 professional clubs are setting a clear mark when they will wear the "We Help - # refugeeswelcome" on the left, instead of the usual sponsorship logo (Hermes).</seg>
<seg id="16">"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," Leverkusens Sports Chief Rudi Völler told the Bild newspaper (Tuesday), calling the project "self-evident."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The refugee drama goes on everyone, no one is allowed to walk away."</seg>
<seg id="18">"We football league players can, no, we need to use our blast, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," Hertha manager Michael Preetz said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league."</seg>
<seg id="20">The national team of women invites 100 refugees to Hall / Saale for the Euro qualifying match against Hungary this Friday.</seg>
<seg id="21">Niersbach called the support of refugees "a large community of German football."</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact that all 36 licensing clubs had started their own projects in their places is great.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active.</seg>
<seg id="24">The message "1-0 for a welcome" we spent is being lived in football.</seg>
<seg id="25">"This is of enormous importance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">This year and next year, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, provides EUR 300 000 each for the integration of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Clubs have already retrieved the full amount for 2015," Niersbach reported.</seg>

<seg id="4">"We can't resort to him, unfortunately," Thomas Tuchel said Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Robot cars: Government wants lead for Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany is said to be technological pioneers in changing the car, according to the wishes of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Federal Cabinet on Wednesday approved a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA auto show about a "new mobility age."</seg>
<seg id="5">Automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and provide less congestion, Dobrindt said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who are also meeting industry representatives at the IAA.</seg>
<seg id="7">The transport ministry's strategy paper stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband and a rapid shift to digital radio.</seg>
<seg id="8">In order to test new technology, a test track is currently being created on Highway 9 in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order to ensure that the driver "does not incur additional liability risks," the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework "and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments."</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permitted speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Federal Government also wants to promote a change to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver becomes more and more passenger.</seg>
<seg id="13">The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Still, driveless vehicles on public roads "are only to be expected well after 2020."</seg>
<seg id="16">The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at Germany's location estimate the study's authors for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Digital networking of the pin can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the question of liability for accidents and the safety of drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.</seg>
<seg id="19">Yet Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or American.</seg>
<seg id="20">A survey by the Forsa Institute on Wednesday on behalf of the audit firm Dekra concludes that only eight per cent of Germans believe that autonom-driven cars will prevail over the next decade, 32 per cent expect only in 20 years, 31 per cent do not believe it at all.</seg>
<seg id="21">In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonom-driven cars by 2025, 33 percent in the US.</seg>
<seg id="22">In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the journey on all roads.</seg>
<seg id="24">On the highway, that could still be 15 percent in flowing traffic, 45 percent in congestion.</seg>
<seg id="25">Well every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances.</seg>

<seg id="3">The highlights: Storefront dolls that look terribly human thanks to video projections.</seg>
<seg id="4">They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madrid's stage outfits - and by putting men in skirts.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I can't say today that I'm the Enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair."</seg>
<seg id="6">"It used to be colourful, now it's real," Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="7">For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the pavement), which can be seen from 18 September at the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the fashion master has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person.</seg>
<seg id="8">Actually, he was against it because, "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">When you die, you come to the museum.</seg>
<seg id="10">The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's all about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Dieders.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.</seg>
<seg id="13">The exhibits give an insight into the barely overlooked work of the man who has written fashion history without ever completing an education.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed overall artwork for which much effort has been made: To freeze the dolls, for example, a stylist has been specially engaged.</seg>
<seg id="15">14 tonnes of material have carved the makers to Munich, according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.</seg>
<seg id="16">Just before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special Schmankerl: A leather hose outfit with corset.</seg>
<seg id="17">Heidi meets Madonna.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Gaultier's old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="20">He stands for the designer's first, tentative fashionable walking attempts.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a child (he wasn't a good student and bad in football) he attracted his Teddy BHs and clothes, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents to.</seg>
<seg id="23">He later taught himself to dismiss fashion.</seg>
<seg id="24">He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Later I bought them of course.</seg>
<seg id="26">For his first own fashion show, he couldn't pay the models.</seg>
<seg id="27">They had nothing but were allowed to keep the clams.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener tip as fashion niche</seg>
<seg id="2">It used to be the long nitrogen machines in and around Plauen to make yards.</seg>
<seg id="3">The embroidered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers who, for example, continued to work on blankets and curtains.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of Modespitze Plauen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Instead, fashion is important again.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the early days of the Plauener tip, fashion played a bigger role, then was pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reinhardt gives some examples: Top in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">At all, the so-called vintage fashion, which opposes past bulletins, is a growing order potential.</seg>
<seg id="9">Anyone who does not use niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.</seg>
<seg id="10">We already make up half of all orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Modespitze Plauen, along with nine other companies, is a member of the industry association Plauener Top and Stickerei.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the past 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have broken away.</seg>
<seg id="14">Private specialty stores and wholesale trade are almost no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our products hardly reach customers by this way.</seg>
<seg id="16">The bulk goods are now produced much cheaper in Asia and are distributed almost exclusively through chains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the US.</seg>
<seg id="18">So there are enough reasons for new ways.</seg>
<seg id="19">The industry association is also trying to score by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains from the Stickperle in Falkenstein: "Since this year we have been leading a quality label that shows that we produce environmentally and socially tolerated."</seg>
<seg id="20">Reinhardt added: "This also refers to the materials used."</seg>
<seg id="21">Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Ausstelle of the Westsächsische Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and tips.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to counter competition from the Asian region, we need to find high-quality and innovative products.</seg>
<seg id="23">That takes time and courage.</seg>
<seg id="24">There is a tension between the designer's freshest ideas and the businesses that need to think primarily economically, "Schmidt says.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.</seg>
<seg id="26">A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snow tip.</seg>
<seg id="27">In some places, the machine stifles small kitchens.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Plauener Goldschmiedemeister Bianca Hallebach-Kraucht was inspired by this: "Before that I couldn't start with traditional Plauener tip."</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she uses the snow tip for her jewelry.</seg>
<seg id="30">In an elaborate procedure, it shapes the pattern in silver.</seg>
<seg id="31">"A lot of people in the region identify with the issue of Plauener tip - young and old," Reuter says.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also supplies to the US, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a memorial.</seg>
<seg id="33">I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener tip.</seg>

<seg id="2">Legends should not be stirred, but Disney still dares to make a new film of its classic "Mary Poppins."</seg>
<seg id="3">However, according to Entertainment Weekly, this is not a refilm, but a kind of sequel that plays with the magical nanny 20 years after the first film.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's about the experiences of the nanny with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.</seg>
<seg id="5">Anyone who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the director already stands firm: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.</seg>

<seg id="1">XI urges to open the economy wider for the world</seg>
<seg id="2">The economy needs to open wider to the outside to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday of a group charged with steering reform.</seg>
<seg id="3">"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve strategies for business start-ups," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leader Group for deepening comprehensive reform.</seg>
<seg id="4">Promoting new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The governing group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list on market access rules, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and overhaul of the population reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the statement, a negative list is being drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, guarantees a legal business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government will also ease controls on the powers conferred on businesses and ensure companies decide how to conduct their business.</seg>
<seg id="10">The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Other areas of private investment will be opened up as part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services to them," the statement said.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits or the Green Card by optimising requirements and facilitating the application process.</seg>
<seg id="14">The right of lawyers to guarantee their activities and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="15">The meeting also included Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement released after the meeting.</seg>

<seg id="2">The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predators, thereby encouraging consumers to have a much higher dose of nervous energy.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Foodwatch consumer organisation, which has a working paper from the EU, strongly criticised the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant women and young children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, large predators are already so heavily burdened with mercury that around 50% of catches cannot be sold on the basis of the remaining limit values.</seg>
<seg id="6">After doubling the limit values, only 14.5% would be irretrievable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In return for this easing, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.</seg>
<seg id="8">Foodwatch, however, called this a "trick" because smaller graveyards, such as carp, are usually so low that they are already complying with the planned highs today.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thus, the reduction in cloning is "a perfidious distraction that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt explained.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched by the food chain, especially in predators.</seg>
<seg id="11">The federal government therefore warns that "already low levels of damage to the nervous system" can cause.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment states on its homepage that there is no risk to public health.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mercury comes into the environment mainly through coal incineration.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to a written statement from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, Germany's coal-fired power plants are producing more than six tonnes of mercury a year, two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">The concentration of mercury in fish, for example, in Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and nationally exceeded," the "Spiegel" quoted from the paper in March.</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU's RASFF alert system.</seg>
<seg id="17">Foodwatch calls on consumers to protest against the EU's plans at: Www.mercury-action.foodwatch.de</seg>
