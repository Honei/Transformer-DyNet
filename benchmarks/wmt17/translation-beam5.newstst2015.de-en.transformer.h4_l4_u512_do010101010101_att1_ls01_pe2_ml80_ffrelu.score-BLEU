It is in-advisable to publish scores from multi-bleu.perl.  The scores depend on your tokenizer, which is unlikely to be reproducible from your paper or consistent across research groups.  Instead you should detokenize then use mteval-v14.pl, which has a standard tokenization.  Scores from multi-bleu.perl can still be used for internal purposes when you have a consistent tokenizer.
BLEU = 30.91, 66.9/39.8/25.7/17.2 (BP=0.939, ratio=0.940, hyp_len=44732, ref_len=47564)
