Gutach : even more safety for pedestrians
they are not 100 metres from each other : on Tuesday in Gutach , the new B 33 pedestrian lamp was put into operation at the village car park - in sight of the older town hall amphiles .
two plants so close to each other : intention or shields ?
yesterday , Gutachs Mayor clearly answered this question .
&quot; the town hall ramp was installed then because it secures the school path , &quot; Eckert explained yesterday .
the small traffic lights secure cyclists as well as bus passengers and the Bergle residents .
the plant officially opened yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße cross @-@ section .
we have the museum , two churches , a spa park , a bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area › Grub ‹ .
&quot; with high traffic and pedestrian traffic , the safety of which required another traffic light , &quot; said Eckert .
this is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Councillor Offenburg .
&quot; according to current measurements , around 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day , of which about ten percent are heavy goods traffic , &quot; says Arnold .
for this reason , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &quot; safety simply goes ahead , &quot; says Arnold .
a total of four traffic jams were carried out , and a roundabout was also planned , but due to the enclosure in the area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .
according to Arnold , everything was tested before when the traffic lights were located : &quot; by means of an extra @-@ long wooden trunks we discovered whether these vehicles could be driven out of the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without cracking the traffic lights . &quot;
Arnold explained .
the system is equipped with colored LEDs that illuminate so strongly that the lights can be easily seen by car drivers , for example , even in the deep sun .
and it is also economical : older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new eight watts .
there are three lighting systems per direction .
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : it is equipped with two radar sensors .
if the pedestrian presses the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .
if the road is free , comes directly green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .
another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be terminated for the pedestrian .
&quot; if a group or disabled people go through the streets , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will be able to travel safely through the tram , &quot; Arnold said .
of course , the driver has to take part as a partner here and watch the train .
this was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the traffic light for pedestrians green , smoked a top @-@ class vehicle - with bright red .
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul .
the Kärntner poet has often described the catastrophes of his Catholic villainism - the lack of language , the tendency to rob violence and savage sexuality , the grandchildren and joylessness .
the winner of the Büchner Prize is known primarily as a prosaautor ; theatre texts are rar in his work .
Collage made of prosthetics Gerhard Fresacher creates a collage of prosthetics for his performance &quot; Weather lights on the tip of the tongue , &quot; which can now be seen in garage X at Petersplatz .
for example , the theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographic novel &quot; Der Leibeigenes &quot; ( 1987 ) with prosaminiums from &quot; Leichnam , his family belauernd &quot; ( 2003 ) .
on the largely empty stage - important Requisit : a shady sofa on which the sound is copied and masturbated - the eight @-@ headed ensemble is hanging through the text material .
Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text .
the 70 @-@ minute performance transmits the template with a wealth of registrations known from the repertoire of post @-@ dramatic forms of play .
the actors , in particular , are involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable sci @-@ fi transformations .
they are hardened hard , washed under the head under the water , torched with their dusk to the wall .
bound in Zellophan or rent , they stir on dangerously high sticks through the staging , either monologize them loudly or lie completely hidden on the stage floor .
however , the text hardly conveys itself in this tough way .
the best moments are the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular limbs .
it is only towards the end that the overturned performance comes to calm , and Winkler &apos;s downright absurd humour appears .
a Blackbox in the Car ?
us road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the dwindling highway system , and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that finds room in each car &apos;s dock .
the devices that record every kilometre and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the federal planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads .
the usually boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colourful alliances .
libertaries have joined forces with environmental groups and are in favour of the government using small boxes to record the kilometres travelled - and possibly also where they were driven - and then using the information to calculate tax rulings .
the Tea Party is appalled .
the US Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .
but , while Congress cannot agree on action , several states are no longer waiting .
they are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile .
thousands of car drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance .
this really is a must for our country .
&quot; it is not something we will only possibly use , &quot; said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn . of Governments , who plans to record the mileage of all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 .
the way we pay these taxes will change .
the technology for this is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , financed from the taxes paid by US Americans at the tipping column , is bankrupt .
but America is no longer dancing as much as before .
cars consume less petrol .
government oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .
politicians do not dare to raise the tax by just one cent at high injections .
&quot; the gasoline tax is simply not sustainable , &quot; says Lee Munnich , an expert in transport legislation at Minnesota University .
his state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile @-@ based payment system .
he said .
bureaucrats call it a mile @-@ based user fee .
it is no surprise that the idea is shared by urban liberals , for the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and harmful emissions .
Californian planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the federal state &apos;s ambitious , legally @-@ based climate change targets .
but the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also said that he sees this as the most viable long @-@ term alternative .
the free distributors of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of letting drivers pay for their journey .
&quot; this is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , &quot; explains Adrian Moore , Vice @-@ President for Reason &apos;s guidelines .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former US Transport Ministers , who in a report in 2011 called on Congress to move towards mile @-@ based settlement .
last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project involving 10,000 cars .
but the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move , responding to the concerns of Members from rural areas who represent people who often have to spend many miles on their way to work or to the city in their daily lives .
several states and major cities nevertheless move in this direction on their own .
Oregon , who currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country &apos;s largest experiment , is the most committed .
these drivers will soon pay mileage fees to the state instead of the oil tax .
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .
new York City is also considering such a thing .
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks .
and the I @-@ 95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently studying how to introduce the amendment .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue any of its movements .
&quot; concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major problem , &quot; says Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Ministry of Transport of Nevada .
people did not want it .
when the test started , the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website : &quot; it would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into sophisticated surveillance devices . &quot;
there is no need to build a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the kilometres travelled , but not exactly when and where .
that would make the public more reassured .
hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .
the company did not originally enter to help states tax drivers .
on the contrary , its aim was to establish a foothold in an emerging market for motor insurance , in which drivers should pay on the basis of the mileage .
but the equipment she tests is also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information , which is regularly uploaded via modem .
&quot; people are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , &quot; said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .
some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes .
there are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .
in Oregon , planners experiment with giving car drivers a number of choices .
you can choose a device with or without GPS .
or they don &apos;t choose any device at all , and instead pay a flat @-@ rate fee based on the average mileage of all residents of the state .
others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than with smaller ones .
in New York City , traffic officials want to develop a tax @-@ based device that can also pay parking fees , pay insurance only for journeys of kilometres , and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time , so that drivers can avoid congestion .
&quot; drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system , &quot; says a city planning document .
some transport planners wonder , however , whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion .
at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for San Francisco Bay , officials said that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax .
an additional one @-@ off fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers using hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so that they too pay a fair share .
&quot; there is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , &quot; explains Randy Rentler , the Commission &apos;s Head of Legislation and Public Affairs .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of car drivers worry about their privacy and many other things .
Königsfeld : small team beats up
the volunteer fire brigade managed their Herbsthauptprobe despite the lack of personnel with Bravour .
only eleven men took part in the exercise .
in his trial , Hans Kammerer chose the property Feder in Burgberger Straße .
a short circuit should have been created there .
two people were injured as a result of the fire and the development of smoke , but one of them was able to send an emergency call .
after the first examination of the facts by Hans Kammerer , two respirators of the Wehr were prepared to enter the building .
after a short time it was possible to find the first person and go to the outside .
the second person had to be worn .
this was not so easy , as a narrow staircase could be overcome .
the building , a workshop with integrated stables for two horses , was not easy to secure .
there was a lot of wood and straw basses in it .
there were also electrical machines for wood processing .
the first extinguishing attack took place via the tank in the vehicle .
a further line was made through a flood hydrants about 100 meters away .
three deletion attacks have now been designed .
a hollow beam tube was also used in the building .
Hans Kammerer was also interested in showing what to do with little available staff .
in case of a crisis , support is provided through the Königsfeld daily intervention group .
the commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .
networking of universities and firms important
on his visit to the Landkreis Breisgau @-@ Hochschwarzwald , Landtag President Guido Wolf was also able to find out in Titisee @-@ Neustadt where the workers of tomorrow come from .
in the Hochschulzwald support centre , he studied this important issue together with the executive directors of the vocational schools and the Kreisgymnasium and the parent board chairman .
&quot; education is an important location factor , &quot; said Claudia Standarle , Director of the Hans @-@ Thoma School , who presented the networked education centre Hochschulzwald .
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .
since 2011 a successful cooperation has been established in the Walderstadt between the Förderzentrum , Kreisgymnasium and vocational school centre .
he also praised the family friendliness in the district .
&quot; it is important not only to look at the family phase , but also to look after family care due to demographic changes , &quot; Wolf said .
he also pointed out that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their families .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , &quot; Wolf said .
but no one can afford to lose skilled workers , he continued .
another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses .
&quot; for anyone who has already learned the benefits of the region during his studies , his acquired knowledge and his skills often remain with the regional economy , which helps to strengthen the region , &quot; said the President of the Country .
it is only by offering sufficient training places that skilled workers can be met .
in his opinion , the geographical advantage of the district is its favourable location in south @-@ west Germany , close to France and Switzerland .
he also experienced on his train journey from Titisee @-@ Neustadt to Freiburg the efforts already made to develop local public transport .
&quot; keep stubborn and make sure that public transport becomes better , &quot; he said .
experience a fun afternoon with music
for 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee , cakes and then a Vesper .
in the past , the elderly were brought to the resting place .
in the meantime , this afternoon will take place in St. Josef nursery .
the locals enjoyed the delicious cakes and torts .
later there were sausages .
Silvia kimmir @-@ Bantle and her father Karl kimmir entertained with popular melodies .
the more than 100 @-@ year @-@ old natural stone wall as the front boundary of the old church to the Kirchstraße is to be reinstated with the town of Bräunlingen .
in the days leading up to the Kilbig , a small walled wall , stabilizing and static discharge of the more than a hundred @-@ year @-@ old stone wall with balustrade , was installed during the first works of the renovation of the front school .
according to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt , the State Monument Office will be included in the plans and a rehabilitation concept for the old wall will be drawn up .
the aim is to calculate costs by experts who will then be put on the table to the Council of Ministers to decide and determine the way forward .
a decision on this is expected to be taken next year .
after the restoration , paving and planting of the old house of the school within the two sides of the school built in 1912 , a follow @-@ up measure must be taken in the foreseeable future to restore the barrier that is in need of restoration and to put it on new substructure .
the historic , one @-@ hundred @-@ year @-@ old wall of the old school to the Kirchstraße , is mainly due to water and frost damage , since there is no drainage , needs to be repaired and has a tendency to advance .
deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage , but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse .
a stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students using Schulhof , which is the result of the current fastening work .
originally , schooling was planned even in 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure caused a shift .
an important word about the historical school foundation , which has even been used for film recordings , will be the National Monument Office .
if guidelines come from this page , the city of Bräunlingen hopes to receive grants from the monument guards .
the students of the Bräunlinger primary school , who are now taught again in a well @-@ restored old school building with a new atrium , will soon be able to use the old school yard .
Özdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir , President of the Federal Republic of the Greens , has now joined the ongoing discussions on the future of the music universities in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; I think it is wrong to abandon holistic education at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart , &quot; said Özdemir , &quot; Stuttgart News . &quot;
jazz and Classics are currently part of the Jazzplatz Stuttgart .
this contradicts Özdemir , who is considered a favorite of a direct mandate in the Bundestag elections on 22 September , the Green @-@ Red Government .
on the basis of an expert study , it is pushing for the reorganisation of the five high schools in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
after that , jazz and pop will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim .
us border : &quot; super tunnels &quot; discovered for drug smuggling
on the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and closed a &quot; super tunnel &quot; for drug smuggling .
as the US customs authorities informed , the tube between Tijuana and San Diego , which was more than 500 metres long , was equipped with electricity , railways and a ventilation system .
three suspects were arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .
according to the information , the tunnel had not yet been used .
&quot; these cartels are stupid if they think they could bury themselves under the radar , &quot; said Laura Duffy , US Secretary @-@ General at a press conference in San Diego , where an end to the tunnel had been discovered .
Duffy told drug gangs : &quot; if you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money . &quot;
both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against drug cartels .
since 2006 , more than 77.000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .
designed by experts
due to the complex equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year .
the track system was equipped so that electrically operated cars could be used .
on the Mexican side there is access to a building 80 meters from the border .
according to authorities , a ladder takes 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters height and 90 cm width .
it would have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration to the United States .
two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the Cocaine Fund .
the third , a Mexican , was taken because of the confiscated marijuana .
as officials have said , all three are threatened with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment .
eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006 , and the press conference in San Diego continued .
but this is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction .
cocaine is usually smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels .
this shows the &quot; despair &quot; of drug gangs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , said Bill Sherman of the Drug Addiction DEA in San Diego .
they would do all they can to get to the US .
no details have been made known about the arrests , at least one of them being Mexicans .
they have to face imprisonment of up to ten years .
2014 : Geisinger Festival
the anniversary of the town of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .
the return of the first mention is getting closer .
when the year ends in just eight weeks , the anniversary year is due .
Geisingen and Church Hausen were first mentioned together in 794 .
a document was produced in churches where both places are mentioned .
on 15 March , there will be an official launch for the anniversary year , and since Geisingen currently has no hall , this launch event will take place in the place where , 1250 years ago , both were first mentioned , in churches .
during the anniversary , numerous events are planned both in Geisingen and in churches .
churches @-@ Hausen will be held in July at a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July .
celebrate return .
on Friday with a party , on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle .
on this festive weekend there is also the Church House .
city Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be performed on three dates .
on 21 June , together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Association , on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle .
this will be completed and inaugurated in the jubilee year , the official date is the last week of September 27 and 28 .
a new chronicle will also be released on the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary .
&quot; however , it should be a chronicle not only of ghosts themselves , but also of a printed work on the ghost of today , which is made up of ghosts , churches @-@ Hausen , Leipferdingen , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen , &quot; says Mayor Walter Hengstler .
and today &apos;s ghost celebrates its birthday in 2014 , while in 1974 the present space was completed with the communitisation .
the new chronicle will be presented in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November .
2014 is another year with many jubilees .
the Narrenzunft Strohglonki starts on 8 February with a traditional dinner on the occasion of its 60 @-@ year @-@ old existence , the harmony Gutmadingen will be 90 years and will have the festival banquet on 29 March and will celebrate the district music festival from 1 to 4 May .
the Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old , the Geisinger school has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May , the Kunstverein Polyhymnia Leipzig becomes 150 years old and celebrates this at the Brunnenfeste from 4 to 7 July .
the town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate held by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764 .
the document was made in churches ( Hausen ) , which was a court .
both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document .
the reason for this 1250 @-@ year anniversary is that it is 40 years later .
Council targets track systems
should the railway transition &quot; Am Hirschen &quot; be extensively restructured to increase road safety ?
yes , the municipal councils have decided .
shield must take € 220 000 into account .
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year .
in particular , safety at railway crossings is to be increased - regular collisions of trains with other vehicles occur throughout Germany .
if the municipalities agree to the conversion measures , they will have to pay one third of the costs , while the rest will be shared by the railways and the federal government .
Schiltach &apos;s mayor Roland Grießbearer explained to the Municipal Council the special features of the &quot; Am Hirschen . &quot;
there , the city plans to build a map at the height of the tunnelmundes west of the railway track .
larger vehicles , such as those transporting langholz , could also be on the opposite side without having to block the tracks .
therefore , Greeks proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .
this was controversial in the Council of Municipalities , because some Councils questioned the need for road proliferation : Thomas Kipp , in his statement , put the critics &apos; mood on the point : &apos; do we have to take so much money out of so few vehicles ? &apos;
Mayor Thomas Haas refuted : the railway crossing &quot; Hirschen &quot; was regularly used for long @-@ distance transport .
even wood from the Kuhbach area is partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road .
in addition , the route would serve as a route for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed , argued Haas .
it should be assumed that Kirchberg- und Schlossbergtunnel would have to be restructured and rehabilitated , as is currently the case in Wolfach , that the railway transition &quot; Am &quot; Hirschen &quot; could also have an important traffic impact for a longer period of time .
the Councils agreed to examine the costs of the planned extension of the road .
in spite of this , the majority of the railway transition was approved , provided that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city could extend the road leading to &quot; Bahnhofstraße , &quot; where appropriate , to around 5.5 metres .
by contrast , the transformation of the railway crossing at Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a very different problem concerning access to the soaring Geroltzhäuser Weg .
the administration had asked the construction plans of the railway from the engineering office Breinlinger , since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of Geroltzhäuser Wegs would be possible .
the investigation found that it was not possible to rule out the possibility that the inclination of the road could lead to longer vehicles being placed .
the responsibility for this is again borne by the city as a road builder .
the conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes .
as both the wooden descent and the bend worked in the current state of construction , one should not agree to the conversion of the railway , Haas argued .
at this point , the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than the other railway crossings , because there is a good visibility connection right next to the centre .
even trains from the main railway station should be held back at this point so that no collision could occur .
the majority of people refused to accept the conversion of this railway line because the city of Schiltach would have to &quot; bathe &quot; the problem with seated vehicles , according to the councils , since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work .
the panel considers the conversion of the railway lines &quot; VorHeubach &quot; and &quot; VorKuhbach , &quot; which have already been concluded with the railway .
ESA decides on major space visions : missions for billions
distant planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the coming years .
30 proposals were made , five are still in the race .
distant worlds .
astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets in other stars .
no one knows whether there are at least some lives .
the choice is difficult : should we look for gravitational waves ?
or would you prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos ?
or , after earth @-@ like planets , discover perhaps alien life ?
the people responsible for the European Space Agency Esa are asking these questions .
for their &quot; Cosmic Vision &quot; program , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects , which will make a decisive contribution to research .
the budget for such &quot; L missions &quot; is approximately EUR 1 billion each .
the start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .
at the beginning of September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
thirty ideas have been discussed , five of which have now been shortlisted .
a number of bodies are examining the proposals , following up with researchers .
a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee in the next few days .
a total of four major questions have been chosen by the Esa , to which the missions of the programme &quot; Cosmic Vision &quot; launched in 2007 will find answers .
what are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life ?
the exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the emergence of planets that surround these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness .
a large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness .
and if a star has planets , under what circumstances can life be created there ?
in order to address this issue , the space telescope &quot; Cheops &quot; will be launched in 2017 , which will examine more closely 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity .
the possibilities are limited , however , cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros .
with larger instruments , astronomers could depict Earth @-@ like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , looking for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this question , too , should ultimately clarify the conditions for the creation of life .
an important factor is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field , as well as the partial radiation that it causes with the planetary system .
in our solar system , these processes can be investigated in an exemplary way .
with the Solar Orbiter , Esa has already approved a M @-@ class mission ( where the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .
the probe should start in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun .
Jupiter and his monks are also of great interest to researchers .
you want to find out what role the giant planet has played in developing the solar system .
for this purpose , Esa provides the first of the three L missions of the &quot; Cosmic Vision &quot; program .
the probe &quot; Juice &quot; ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to start its journey in 2022 .
eight years later she reaches Jupiter and is supposed to study the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moon of Europe , KALLISTO and Ganymed .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
the world offers many ways to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there .
perhaps there are also deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .
how did the universe emerge and what does it consist of ?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos were created by the Big Bang .
in addition to the common matter of stars , planets and living beings like us , there are dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxies together , and dark energy , which accelerates the expansion of world space .
so far , researchers do not know what physical laws were in force in the first seconds of the Big Bang , nor what are dark matter and dark energy .
with &quot; Euclid , &quot; the Esa has already approved an M mission for 2020 .
with a special telescope , the probe is supposed to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky , thus providing insights into the nature of dark matter and dark energy .
who could do the race
of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure .
many experts believe that the best chances of obtaining an L mission are &quot; E @-@ Lisa , &quot; an ambitious concept for detecting gravitational waves .
this means changes in the structure of the space time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .
they have not been proved to date .
Elisa could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .
the mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes located in space .
in contrast to installations on Earth , he could also prove gravitational waves that emerged at the time of the Big Bang , thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos .
four other proposals compete for the second L mission : a large X @-@ ray telescope called &quot; Athena , &quot; which is to explore , among other things , black holes , &quot; Icy Planets , &quot; another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , &quot; Prism , &quot; a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , &quot; Finlanet . &quot;
among other things , proposals for sampling back transport from Mars , for exploration of moon , Venus and asteroids , and solar physics are already out .
Snowden ready to &quot; cooperate &quot; with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has stated that he is ready to travel to Berlin and promise before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities .
German MEP Hans @-@ Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where he received this asylum to discuss with him the statement in Germany .
in a letter from Snowden presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , he wrote : &quot; although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a fidelity and is trying to criminalise political expression with a criminal offence where no defence is possible . &quot;
saying the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American Government to drop the charge against him .
the indictment brought by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property .
German Interior Minister Hans @-@ Peter Friedrich said to Time Online : &quot; if Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German representatives , then we will find ways to make this possible . &quot;
relations between the US and Germany are burdened by claims that the NSA has stopped Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s mobile phone .
Thomas Oppermann , the Member who leads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that we should seize the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness , if possible , &quot; without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US . &quot;
Strobele , a member of the Greens , published an image of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .
he was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .
flubele explained that , according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden , he could not return to Russia if he left the country .
when Snowden says in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is &quot; safe &quot; there , he says .
Snowden says in his letter that he would be exposed to a &quot; serious and continuous &quot; campaign of persecution that has driven him out of his homeland .
but he is touched by the global response to &quot; my act of political expression . &quot;
citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians - including in the United States - have described revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a public service .
in his letter , Snowden makes an offer of cooperation available to the German authorities &quot; when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . &quot;
frontier Airlines charges handbaggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 for passengers who wish to collect hand baggage on their flight .
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade , even if it was stated in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers are likely to keep the whole dosage .
the new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage box above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free .
Frontier explained that if the fee is paid in advance , the US $ 25 is calculated for travellers who only paid at the airport .
frontier Spokesperson Kate O &apos;Malley said that the fee of $ 100 aims to encourage travellers to pay in advance .
&quot; we do not want to calculate this sum , &quot; she said .
in 2008 , airlines started to charge for the first and second pieces of baggage .
passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore placed as much as possible in their hand baggage , which means that baggage boxes above the seat are often overfilled .
fees are a way of encouraging passengers to take less on board .
O &apos;Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .
it is about the most loyal customers of Frontier , who have clearly stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the field above the seat .
passengers who buy their tickets on the airline &apos;s website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a piece of baggage free of charge at Frontier , but the next person must pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of baggage .
O &apos;Malley explained that Frontier &apos;s website and check @-@ in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they came to the airport .
Frontier &apos;s new hand baggage charge will only enter into force in summer , and there is no exact date yet .
passengers often use baggage allowances and other charges , but airlines like to use them .
they argue that the transportation of baggage should cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they wish .
many on Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
however , most have left the fingers of hand baggage charges .
spirit Airlines Inc . , the first charge for hand baggage three years ago , followed later by Allegiant Air , also a low @-@ cost airline .
the only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air , explained the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who is closely following the additional fees .
in a December 2011 report , he estimated that the Spirit hand baggage allowance would bring $ 50 million annually .
Sorensen , who formerly held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines , recently fled with Spirit and was curious about what would be expected at the airlift if passengers were confronted with the company &apos;s unusual hand baggage charge .
&quot; the Boarding Process was one of the cleanest I have experienced in my career in aviation , &quot; he said .
I expected to see teeth and hands @-@ on discussions at the airlift .
&quot; the plane was full , &quot; he said , &quot; and boarding ran as if it was . &quot;
Frontier also follows Spirit with the $ 2 required for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .
the company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep all the cans and that coffee would be filled free of charge .
water is still free .
us Airways had been short @-@ lived in trying to demand money for soft drinks in 2008 , but this was reversed seven months later , after passengers complained and no other major company had followed suit .
frontline move to charge handbaggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative aimed at directing customers to their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies like orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold .
this provides an incentive for all companies to get passengers to buy directly from them rather than via an online travel agency .
but Frontier has gone furthest in this area .
in September , the company started to award half the number of frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency .
on Wednesday , miles were cut back to 25 % of the flight .
for this reason , a flight with frontier over 1000 miles booked with a third party provider brings only 250 miles .
passengers can also reserve seats only when purchasing directly on the Frontier site .
Frontier has a loyal customer base in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .
the proceeds fell by 9 % and the flight capacity shrank by just 13 % in the first quarter , as stated in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc .
Republic has tried to control Frontier &apos;s finances in the context of the sale of society .
proverb words come from the Bible
well 40 women visited the last female breakfast of this year in the evangelical parish of Bisingen .
the theme of the day at the Municipal House was &quot; proverb words from the Bible &quot; and &quot; speeches from the Middle Ages . &quot;
after breakfast , Zita Köhler , chairman of the Church Council , addressed the biblical proverb words .
she said .
she compared several proverb words with the corresponding bibles and explained the meaning .
she called proverb words like : wood oaks are vigilant , as scales fall from the eyes , throwing an eye on someone who gives his son in sleep , washing his hands into innocence .
on several occasions , the speaker also advised her listeners what the proverb was .
in the Middle Ages , the parish priest Christel Dehner took the floor : all good things are three , make blue , a little shy .
she explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called &quot; bridges into the past . &quot;
finally , a tombola was lost .
the prizes were covered on a table and were rewritten humorously before being handed over to the winners .
among the visitors of the breakfast round also was Mayor Roman Waizenegger .
learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
a pilot project for the tourism sector was launched at the Mecklenburgische Seenplate .
under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 women and men who already work as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified for hotels and restaurants over three winter .
&quot; what &apos;s new is that the six @-@ month courses with degrees end , &quot; said Carmen Wiechert of the agency Neubrandenburg .
the benefits are manifold : the participants would not be unemployed , firms would have trained professionals who were increasingly missing in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .
the project also includes the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
NSA declares that an &quot; internal error &quot; and not hackers are to blame for the crashes of the website
the shadowy National Security Agency announced late Friday that an error had paralysed its public website some hours , not hackers , as was claimed online .
&quot; NSA.gov was not available this night for a few hours because an internal error occurred during a planned update , &quot; explained the spy agency in an email message .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .
in the early evening hours , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and that this is still not available to some users .
prior to that , a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the authority was &quot; in no way &quot; compromised .
secret information is not in danger , he said .
at least one group of hackers claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .
in the event of such attacks , the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses .
cybertactic is relatively simple , and attacks do not serve to penetrate the target system &apos;s internal network .
the former super @-@ secret NSA , whose nickname was no search agency ( no such authority ) , is now in the public &apos;s light and is exposed to sharp criticism following the revelations that have been published in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad - a result of the NSA &apos;s secret NSA data .
the growing controversy over the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of targeted cyber operation .
slightly decreased the number of people without a job in October by 22 to 1.307 .
although the 3.1 % quota is better than last year and better than in September , &quot; we would have hoped for more , &quot; says Monika felder @-@ Bauer , Deputy Managing Director of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen .
many companies have so far responded to recruitment behaviour .
one reason for this is , according to the field farmer : &quot; we have few skilled workers in the craft , healthcare and care for the elderly . &quot;
since September , annual employment offers for staff in the hotel and catering sector have been resumed .
the winter season starts in mid @-@ December .

loss of profit at Bombardier following decline in delivery figures and orders
on Thursday , Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % decrease in net profits after being pressurised by declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter , as well as contract problems in the railway sector .
Bombardier , based in Montreal , did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use next September in accordance with the ambitious timetable .
so far , only three more startups followed the young @-@ distance flight of the test aircraft a year and a half ago , which makes it doubtful whether the test phase will be as planned .
the results fell short of forecasts and led to a fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .
Cameron Doerksen , an analyst at National Bank Financial , downgraded his assessment of &quot; outperform &quot; to &quot; sector &quot; on Thursday , with a limited exchange rate potential in the next one to two quarters .
&quot; while weaker aircraft delivery figures were expected to be as broad as possible , we are clearly disappointed by the development of the margins in the transport sector , &quot; Doerksen said in a customer letter .
we believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the test programme for the aircraft progresses .
however , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .
Bombardier hopes that CSeries &apos; aircraft take @-@ off will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .
the first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays .
but , so far , binding orders for CSeries with 177 are moderate , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company &apos;s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new jet aircraft are correct .
there are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .
on Thursday , the management also assured analysts and media that the program was on schedule .
&quot; the test aircraft is no longer on the ground than expected , &quot; said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft &apos;s standstill .
each manufacturer plans differently .
we have decided to take a first flight and then attach a review period , as we have done .
this is happening throughout the programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining one shortly thereafter , was said by the company side .
nevertheless , analysts remain sceptical as to whether , twelve months after the maiden flight , the first customer can start operating a CSeries aircraft .
Bombardier explained that it is reviewing the planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and will update it in the coming months .
&quot; the slow progress of the flight test - even though it appears that they correspond to BOMBARDIERS internal planning - reinforces our view that the start @-@ up is moving to the first quarter of 2015 , &quot; Doerksen said .
in the third quarter with the end of September 30 BOMBARDIERS net profit fell to $ 147 million or $ 8 cents per share of $ 172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year .
the adjusted profit per share remains 9 cents .
sales fell slightly from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars .
analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer says that he delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a decrease of 57 last year .
net orders were from 83 aircraft to 26 .
the order book in the aerospace sector was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September , unchanged from 31 December .
&quot; in the aerospace sector , the results were in line with our requirements , but low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , &quot; said Beaudoin .
revenues in the aerospace sector fell 13 percent to $ 2 billion .
Bombardier , the world &apos;s largest railway manufacturer , announced that revenues in this business grew by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .
the order book in the transport sector was $ 32.6 billion on 30 September , slightly increasing from 31 December .
the profit margin in the transport sector was affected by resolution problems in some major contracts .
according to corporate governance , there will be new benchmarks for the fourth quarter .
in the afternoon trading on Thursday , the Bombardier share plummeted by 8.5 % and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars , after it was also announced that the Google Finance Board will change to the Board of Directors Patrick Pichette .
Brazilian Embraer SA , the world &apos;s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and BOMBARDIER &apos;s closest rival , reported a 10 % decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday .

cocaine @-@ dependent lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must go to prison
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave information to Neil Scarborough
the lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light
he was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
a well @-@ known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison .
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave Neil Scarborough the underworld with sensitive information about his drug @-@ trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction .
the lawyer praised by criminals as &quot; first class &quot; with the nickname &quot; Bash &quot; was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police oversaw Scarborough , which he had represented in an earlier drug procedure .
officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three Beutel Kokain at the lawyer &apos;s house in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a meal of the Bar .
the investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in its hair , wallet and credit cards .
over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he attempted to obtain unauthorised information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .
all four suspects were then monitored by the police under a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .
together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after the police secured £ 1.5 million in cash in a series of house searches for heroin and cocaine .
ditta , 42 , passed on information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be publicised .
today , Ditta , who works for the firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool Crown Court following a three @-@ week trial on two charges for obstructing the judiciary .
he gave up cocaine ownership during an earlier consultation .
the lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigation of Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .
two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta &apos;s house , where drugs were placed under the lawyer &apos;s garbage with a purity of 60 % .
shortly after he delivered the drugs , Scarborough regularly contacted Ditta , who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park .
the lawyer returned home , took drugs and nine communications were exchanged between the two .
it became known in court that Ditta was a &quot; regular consumer &quot; of cocaine after tests of class A drugs discovered in his hair , wallets and on his credit cards .
ditta was later arrested , but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client , claiming that her discussion was subject to &quot; lawyer secrecy . &quot;
during his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were secured and he was taken from a hair sample .
at the time of police interrogation , he stated that he was running an office under his private address as well as in the workplace , and clients would call him at home for legal matters .
it became known in court that he had appealed to key players in the drug trade , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them .
prosecutor Anne Whyte said : &quot; a criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not broken . &quot;
ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender , because he has entered too much with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply a drug trader , but a drug trader who supplies his lawyer with drugs .
some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .
but that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he acted as far as possible to prevent police investigations so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .
Mr Ditta thus discredited his profession .
he was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .
ditta dismissed any misconduct and claimed : &quot; if I were a corrupt lawyer , what I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do so immediately . &quot;
but , after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said : &quot; Mr Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he started buying drugs from organised criminals . &quot;
his cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime , who asked him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .
lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence .
ditta missed this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .
Lancashire &apos;s Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation against Ditta , which also led to a conviction in three cases for the possession of cocaine and judicial impairment , underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice .
this case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .
we find you and bring you to justice .
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he declared himself guilty of the conspiracy to trade in heroin , cocaine and cannabis .
thirty @-@ five more people involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to a total sentence of 153 years for drug offences .
on his website , Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he indicated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and opportunity inequality was the motivation for his work .
revolutionary work of church music
at the end of the celebrations on the occasion of his 160 @-@ year @-@ old existence , the Liederkranz Dunningen will enlarge two services with Franz Schubert &apos;s &quot; Deutsche Messe . &quot;
after the great success of the musicals &quot; Rock my Life , &quot; which attracted the audience this spring , the Liederkranz will enrich two worship services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German Fair of Franz Schubert .
on Saturday , October 26 , this extraordinary trade fair will be held from 19 during the evening fair in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday 27 October at 10.15 a.m. at the Church of St. John Baptistkirche in Lackendorf .
the so @-@ called &quot; Deutsche Messe &quot; with the original title &quot; Geschen zur Feier des sacred victims der Messe , &quot; D 872 , is a spiritual music work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of its creation .
the exhibition will be performed within the framework of the services provided by the client Johann Philipp Neumann .
under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the music association Frohnig Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ .
Haslach : skepticism soars confidence
the 2015 Parish Council elections , for example , will see fundamental changes in Haslach ( SE ) .
there is then only a common parish council for all six parishes .
in a joint meeting on Saturday , the committees from Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes .
the diocese &apos;s basic decisions have nothing to change and it is up to the parish council to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .
in the course of the day , it became particularly clear : skepticism about the new is hesitating but growing in confidence .
from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the very constructive discussions between the six bodies with the main body of the soul @-@ keeping team were enough .
on the basis of a presentation , regional dekan Georg Schmitt presented the new guidelines for soul care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg .
after that , SE Haslach , as a church community , will in future form a body of public law that will enter the rights and duties of six separate church communities .
there will only be a common parish council and a board of foundations in which the parish authority is represented .
at least two elected members are to be represented from each parish , and so @-@ called community teams are formed in the six parishes .
your task will be to promote church life in the village .
the question of the finances of the individual parish then showed considerable need for discussion .
the innovations provide for the retention of accumulated credits in the parishes .
however , the liabilities are transferred to the overall community .
particularly with regard to the large planned investments , the commitment of which was then made by all the parishes , there was great concern .
&quot; even in the past , investment was only made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone , &quot; Haslach &apos;s Parish Council Chairman Bruno Prinzbach relative .
practical experience with a common body for five parish priests described Barbar Ritter , the chairman of the body in the Schutterwald @-@ Neuried Soul Unit .
in 2006 , they set themselves the task of &quot; becoming one , remaining five , &quot; and found that this is not so easy .
the bodies of the Haslacher Soul Unit were then asked to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .
the discussions will take place at further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
in the end , the parish commune Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the soul unit , which was approved by a clear majority .
in Pfullendorf , electricity is becoming more expensive
the citizens of Pfullendorfs must adapt to higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the Stadtwerke , Jörg @-@ Arne Bias , confirmed to the SÜDKURIER , a four @-@ legged Pfullendorfer family will cost 70 to 90 euros per year .
the main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so @-@ called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt @-@ hour .
this levy is reset each year in October by the four operators of the major electricity routes .
these quantify the additional costs they incur as a result of the energy transition , which they can charge through a charge above the electricity price .
Pfullendorf is the last link in this chain .
according to Jörg @-@ Arne Bias , the Supervisory Board of the energy company even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts .
now the actual figures would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers of the exact price increase next week .
&quot; we expect an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; says Bias , with the number more close to 2 cents .
traffic light on permanent red : pay attention to waiting time
sometimes a traffic light is simply not green .
the contact cabinet in the street does not react , or the light sign is defective .
what should we do then - ride at red ?
if an affected person has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explained the lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine &quot; Motorrad . &quot;
however , waiting time must be &quot; adequate , &quot; which can be interpreted differently from one case to another .
Becker advises you to stop at least five minutes before starting from a malfunction of the amplifier .
however , anyone who continues to drive despite red light must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it .
anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and points to a decision taken by the Oberlandesgericht Hamm .
in the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light breach .
after all , the traffic light was not defective , but soon afterwards spread to green .
he was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine .
municipal Council welcomes sound budget
when it comes to budget meetings , Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well .
the municipal waste in Herdwangen @-@ Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known since 2005 .
the 2012 financial year can also be regarded as a complete success .
this was evident in the presentation of the 2012 accounts .
as Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget was about EUR 7.6 million higher than planned .
the surplus in the administrative budget is also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach .
the surplus was mainly due to higher commercial tax revenue and the share of the municipal income tax .
again , the wealth budget was well above the projected values .
instead of the planned EUR 1.5 million , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .
said Rothmund .
as less investment has been made than planned in the 2012 financial year , recovery has also increased .
overall , the overall reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million .
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .
&quot; such a work is not just shaking out of the sleeve , &quot; Gerster praised the accounts .
he and the local councils deliberately welcomed the good figures .
it may sound paradoxical , but these very good figures could soon cost citizens a great deal .
due to the good financial situation , the municipality has in the past been able to renounce high levels of hegemony .
according to Gerster , this has often reduced subsidies from the country .
there are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory booths .
among other things , cities and municipalities applying for grants will have to display certain headings .
&quot; we need to look at the issue of headache , as investment is expected in the coming years , for which we would like to receive grants , &quot; said Gerster .
Nagold : Hugo Wermter for 60 years
with 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter &apos;s story is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest in which he was solemnly honoured .
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colours of his male club .
after 60 years , he still enjoys singing with the choir that he has won .
Wermter was also active in the association , including for 28 years as a member of the committee .
he received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association : Jörg Kohr , Pastoralreferent on behalf of the Cäcienverband Rottenburg @-@ Stuttgart , presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - with a certificate of association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst .
his singers handed him the certificate of the German choral association and a grained tin plate .
in addition to the honors , the 31st Autumn Festival took place in familiar ways : with the MGV betra , the Liederkranz Salzstetten , the singer &apos;s department Baisingen and the local music association , the full mariners had loaded a colourful mix of different choirs and singing styles , which kept around 400 visitors .
the MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like &quot; Im Weinparadies &quot; and &quot; Lustig , her brethren . &quot;
their honorary recipient , Hubert Wermter , prepared a small permanent - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart &apos;s &quot; Bundeslied . &quot;
the men &apos;s club betra also sang classical choral songs such as &quot; Jägerwerben &quot; by Julius Wengert , &quot; Weit , far away &quot; by Hubert Goisern and the folk song &quot; When you go through the valley . &quot;
the Liederkranz salt stetten , with its mixed choir and its women &apos;s group - the &quot; impulse choir &quot; - provided the female rate of the festival .
the mixed choir abducted with the Neapolitan folk &quot; Santa Lucia &quot; and &quot; Eviva Espana &quot; from Antos Gus to foreign countries , while the &quot; impulse &quot; also used foreign languages : &quot; Liberatio &quot; and &quot; Hey Jude &quot; were part of their programme .
the singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to local Gefilde with &quot; What the Schwob ? &quot; by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts &quot; Bierlied &quot; where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion .
for the children there was a small side program - &quot; Oma Hanne &quot; alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a casperle theatre and read a few stories that gave children a good lunch .
children &apos;s dreams come true
the kindergartens and nurseries in the customs district will receive mail these days .
in cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb , the Schwarzwälder Bote wishes to assist the institutions in realising their construction and beauty wishes .
does the kindergarten need a new sandbox ?
all kindergartens , nurseries and crèches from the entire customs group can participate in the action .
if you have a desire for construction or beauty for your facility , you can apply for it at the Black Forest Bows .
be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Action Kindergarten @-@ Baustelle .
a jury made up of representatives of Black Forest Bote , Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb , selects three wishes from all entries .
what are the conditions for participation ?
the wish should be realised with construction material of a maximum value of EUR 2000 and on a day ( action ) .
in addition , the winner himself must provide for many hard @-@ working builders .
what about the day of action and the helpers ?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb .
it is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the helpers .
helpers can be parents , grandparents , friends , clubs and of course the educators and children themselves .
Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law
&quot; we are in a frightening situation and we should ask ourselves : what does Parliament stop from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow ? &quot; was stated in the newspaper , which considers the draft law not constitutional .
&quot; the law is draconian and very punishable and we reject it , &quot; said Cyrus Kamau , Managing Director of the Capital Group , including CapitalFM , one of Kenya &apos;s most prestigious independent radio stations and news websites .
he said that the new media tribunal &quot; will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of the government , &quot; and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya &apos;s position in the global economy .
he said .
according to The Star , the new law &quot; effectively puts the media in a hurry . &quot; by contrast , The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of Speech in Kenya wrote &quot; a heavy blow &quot; and called it &quot; draconian . &quot;
the adoption of the law is one of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September .
the Kenyan media attracted the anger of the authorities by publishing pictures of security cameras showing how the units sent to the scene allegedly wiped out the luxurious shopping centre .
police chief David Kimaiyo responded by hiring two journalists and a leading media representative , even though the charge was withdrawn following a media outcry .
under the new law , media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shields , and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .
the Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid .
according to the Daily Nation , &quot; a single punishment can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . &quot;
moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya &apos;s &quot; lively blogosphere &quot; description .
if they silence the media , politicians could do whatever they want with impunity .
&quot; no one will ever know it , &quot; wrote Mutuma Mathiu , a journalist at the nation , who calls the Kenyan media a crucial control factor in public life .
&quot; leave politicians , lead the country into bankruptcy and return us to the time of hunters and collectors , &quot; he commented .
the Kenyan legislators have in the past attracted public anger .
in May , they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and put back their defective salaries of around 532,000 schilling bills per month - among the highest in the world .
bad @-@ Dürrheim : a dream becomes true for FC
the importance for the city and the football club did not include the official opening ceremony for the artificial grass sports area , despite the cold weather and rain .
I think everyone wanted a nice party last Saturday , but Petrus didn &apos;t want to play .
for example , all those who came without a rain umbrella or who could not keep one for any reason .
this went to the musicians who surrounded the ceremony , as did many speakers .
nass was therefore also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker , who spoke of fulfilling a dream .
first of all , his thanks were due to Mayor Walter Klumpp , who has worked hard to implement the project , the municipal council , the companies involved and members of the association .
here especially Lothar Held , Paul Weizenegger , Heiner Gail and Peter Graf .
the rugged pensioners laid 400 square metres of paving stones for the new paths .
this remarkable honorary commitment was also appreciated by the councillor Karl Rombach .
other words of greeting for the City Sports Committee Hubert Baier , District Chairman of the South @-@ Baden Football Association , Kuno Kayan , and Friedrich Knorr of the Planning Office , who announced a donation to the club &apos;s Youth Department .
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that recurring weather @-@ related influences in spring and autumn put the original lawn in such a way that he could not be played .
15 years ago , we had the first thoughts on solving the problem when we were thinking about building a third place at the football club or at the Saline Lake Realschule .
both were rejected again .
six years ago , thought was given to setting up an artificial grass field , which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were launched two years ago , when the FC took over the Schabelstube in succession , pledged a cost contribution of € 100 000 for the construction of the site and approved the country for € 104 000 .
in October 2012 , the Council decided to take over the remaining € 356 000 in the total cost of € 560 000 , summarised Klumpp .
the construction of the 68 @-@ 108 @-@ metre artificial track was started on 4 June .
during the three @-@ month construction phase , 3000 cubic metres of earth were carried out , half of which was used to set up a Dirt @-@ Bike route .
the Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on home affairs and justice .
the relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning .
these include direct democracy , assembly and the Federal Police .
in the morning , the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions .
this should include the issue of dual citizenship , where both sides have conflicting ideas .
the SPD wants to end the coercion for immigrants born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport .
on the subject of transport , which is not on the agenda this Friday , the SPD supported its opposition to a car toll requested by the CSU .
a vignette is a &quot; flatrate for many riding and therefore environmentally counterproductive , &quot; said Florian Pronold , the SPD negotiator on transport .
there was a threat of alternative traffic on rural roads , which are already priority areas for accidents .
the introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from the point of view of Pronolds .
he said .
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart : the singing Föhnwelle on the open @-@ air stage

drivers seriously injured in accidents
a 37 @-@ year @-@ old driver from Aachen was seriously injured in an accident on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a 41 @-@ year @-@ old man was travelling in the direction of Grefrath by 21.15 with her car on the Kempener outer ring .
when he wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße , she looked over the front car of the 37 @-@ year @-@ old .
the driving spells collided .
the Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be brought to hospital for treatment .
constance : closure after accident at Schänzlekreisel
the accident was caused by police , when a 51 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a Swiss Seat of Ibiza on Thursday evening , at 8 p.m. , on the left lane of the two @-@ lane highway .
shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle , he noticed that he was on the left bank in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane .
this resulted in a collision with a 23 @-@ year @-@ old BMW .
the VW Passat behind the BMW was also damaged by a 19 @-@ year @-@ old .
in total , around 15,000 material damage was caused , the police reported .
the track had to be blocked during the accident , as it continued .
Vienna Airport issues passenger calls
Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .
in the future , there will no longer be statements like this at Vienna @-@ Schwechat Airport .
most of the speakers fail to do so - the noise level should be significantly reduced .
creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation .
as Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien , Vienna Airport follows an international trend by setting a record on individual people .
for example , airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai are already abandoning the noisy calls .
the removal of these divergences - on average , around 200 personal calls from the speakers on a day - is expected to make the airport quieter .
&quot; it has also been shown in experience that these individual breakthroughs have been relatively little perceived , but at the same time all other information on changed flights or departures here is a bit down , &quot; says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station .
Highlander Games at Kaltenhof
in addition to braking with tractors , there is a second competition at the autumn agricultural festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September .
on Saturday , 7 September , the Highlander Games start at 1.30 p.m.
they have a Scottish tradition , but they are weak on the Kaltenhof .
teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of nursery , hockey throwing and water wear .
four and a half meters long and 25 to 30 kg hard .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter , &quot; explains the organizer Peter Saile .
the tribe must be discarded in a vertical manner , if it is to be overrun and then just come to bed .
this is assessed with most points .
when throwing a hose , it is important to have a precise target .
eight meters away is thrown on a pike .
the participants must demonstrate skill and strength at the water ice bearing over 50 meters .
time and amount of water in a bottomy are measured at the end .
from each &quot; clan &quot; or team , two may participate in the individual competition .
the winners of the competition will receive prizes .
training can be done from 10 a.m.
a suitable clothing is desired , for example , the competition can take place in the chassis rock .
but Swabian tradition is also allowed .
for &quot; outfit , &quot; the jury gives a few bonus points .
you can register up to one hour before the start of the competition .
with the Scottish @-@ Swabian Highlander Games and the Traktor pulling , which starts half an hour earlier , a lot of action has been promised on Saturday &apos;s festival grounds .
in the evening , the brass musicians will be at their expense .
at 7 o &apos;clock the bi @-@ rabbit brass music from Schömberg creates the great evening of entertainment .
the band plays fleet Polkas and fairy tales .
but their repertoire also includes emotional walkers and a rich big band sound .
the Heinz Koch from Weilen , known as the sinking host and black sausage baron , will be part of it .
in Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzunft .
on Sunday the Musikverein Leinstetten runs for early dinner , from 2 p.m. the farmhouse chapel Böffingen is a guest , and the &quot; Oldies &quot; will end the festival .
starting on Friday is the Stoppelackerparty with DJ Ralf .
on Saturday and Sunday , the programme will include the Easter and Silesia Meeting , exhibitions by companies on agriculture and forestry .
other attractions on Sunday are the Maislabyrinth , the craft market and the sheep shepherd .
especially for children there is a string zoo , Strohhüpfburg , tractor riding ( under instruction ) and tractor surfing .
the organisers are the Förderverein Mehrpurpose Halle , the Ski Club and the Traktorfreunde &quot; Zünpkäpsele . &quot;
overview of milk and egg alternatives
vegan nutrition requires vegetable alternatives to eggs , milk and milk products .
ploughed tofu with plant gel is , for example , a quantum replacement .
other names include the Vegetarian and World Vegetarian Day on 1 November .
on the occasion of World Vegetarian Day on 1 November , Germany is proposing a number of vegan alternatives :
pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter , yoghurt is replaced by soya yoghurt .
instead of milk , soya , oat , almond or rice milk can be used .
retractable planting foils replace traditional abattoirs .
there are also vegetable alternatives to eggs .
half a crushed , mature banana , for example , can replace an egg as a binder in a cake .
also 50 grams of apples or a tablespoon of laminated linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this .
loosely , dough instead of egg , for example , with a mixture of a teaspoon baking powder , a dessert starch and three tablespoons of mineral water .
but also 50 grams of soya yoghurt or soya ofu can fulfil this purpose .
according to the Vebu , around 800 000 people are currently feeding vegan in Germany , which is pure vegetable .
sleepless in New York
on the way to their host families in Weymouth , Massachusetts , students at the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American capital New York .
after eight hours of flight , the Brooklyn Bridge , which reached the heart of the city , Manhattan , on foot .
a fascinating view of the world @-@ famous skyline , which is a special attraction in the evening .
due to the shift in time , students were on their legs for almost 24 hours , but according to the motto &quot; The city does not sleep &quot; the day was decided at Times Square .
despite Shutdown , on the second day the statue of freedom could be reached by a ferry and reached on foot .
then it was through Wall Street &apos;s financial center to commemorate 11 September .
on the third day , students from the 373 meter high viewing platform of the Empire State Buildings were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city and enjoy the view .
after that , it was through the hectic drive of New York &apos;s streets through the Rockefeller Center to Central Park , which provided an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from New York to Boston , students have now arrived in their host families and experience school life at the Weymouth High School .
a Hubertusmesse is celebrated this year in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülsbergstraße .
St. Hubertus was the saga of a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Lüttich .
the Jagdhorn group of the Jagdreiter Westphalia , under the direction of Brigitte Kluth , plays on Parforcehörern ( natural listeners in the mood Es ) according to old French melodies .
the leaves wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders , horses and dog species on trawling .
the ceremony will take place on Sunday , November 3 , at 11.30 a.m.
the new look shines with a new cafe .
one that invites you to stay and return .
one that wants to make the name of the program .
according to the lexicon , Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the sense that it has experienced or seen a new situation .
in case of a visit to the café of the same name in the district town of Kleve in sight to the Hochschule Rhein @-@ Waal , it does not have to remain with the pure déjà Vu feeling .
after all , the café , with its beautiful name , aims to make a real stay not only enjoyable , but also to make it easy to experience again and again .
because it &apos;s fun and simply beautiful .
a glance into the inner life of Opvent 8 gives the viewer a good feeling .
the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art but non @-@ cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good .
the team will spoil you with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with a variety of coffee or cocktail options .
there are also delicious cakes or individually prepared fresh baguettes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the charming café at the Opera : in Kranenburg they held the &quot; Art Lounge . &quot;
from the move to Kleve , the friendly café lovers expect more audience .
not least by the university .
&quot; while we do not have a specific target group , &quot; Daniel Büttner stressed .
on the contrary , the two students here want to address young people in the same way as senior citizens and all ages .
speaking of café lovers .
the pleasant couple is behind the coffee pleasure .
enjoy the fragrant hot costume in the various variations .
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker .
&quot; for this a baguette - that &apos;s my thing , &quot; she tells the NRZ .
two events were also held in the bright café .
better said one .
after all , the port festival took place outside - Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .
but there was also the Ringelnatzend .
&quot; beautiful , successful and funny , &quot; found the 33 year olds .
but it is not Jedermann &apos;s business .
perhaps Daniel Büttner is not a loud fan of event evenings either : &quot; you cannot do justice to everyone . &quot;
and with an event I always speak only to those who are interested in the special event .
therefore events will be the exception for us .
&quot; we want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible . &quot;
should read : Déjà Vu also stands for reliability .
with regard to the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the finish line in Kleve .
the road is becoming more and more a gastronomic part .
to the delight of many Klever , the guests from close and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus the Café Déjà Vu .

a day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
it was the 165 @-@ year foundation to which the MGV &quot; Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker &quot; invited this year and 52 guests , active singers and their wives , were happy to come .
at the &quot; Witteborg &quot; restaurant in Dinker , everyone enjoyed the harmonious coexistence of music .
traditionally , the foundation festival is always the perfect festival for honors .
this time writer Rolf Wagener was delighted with the special award &quot; singer of the year . &quot;
&quot; you have not only written a lot for us , but also made so many rounds for us , for which our heartfelt thanks , &quot; says Chores Erich Schlotmann .
the awards for participation in the performances and choir samples by means of activity were awarded this year to the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participants , followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier @-@ Ribbert , the chairman himself , and last year &apos;s &quot; singer of the year &quot; Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each .
place five was occupied by Artur Brückner .
a special thank you to the Board of Directors to Ange Pier @-@ Ribbert &apos;s team , who once again enchanted a top @-@ class menu and sent to Gerda Pier @-@ Ribbert for table decoration .
the MGV &quot; Friedrich @-@ Wilhelm &quot; meets every Tuesday at 7.45 p.m. for his regular choral tests .
&quot; new gentle voices are always welcome , &quot; says Schlotmann .
UN announces new targets for poverty reduction
the United Nations is now beginning to develop a number of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction announced 12 years ago .
in the run @-@ up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting &quot; Sustainable Development Goals &quot; to replace the Millennium Goals , which expire in 2015 .
they have been included in the final draft document adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .
UN Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to &quot; think beyond national interests . &quot;
&quot; I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch a process to agree on universal , sustainable development goals , &quot; he said .
&quot; these objectives will build on our progress in the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post @-@ 2015 framework for development .
I will spare no effort in implementing this mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Goals . &quot;
even though SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , there is still good mood in the handball upper ligists .
coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this .
everyone remains fully motivated .
nevertheless , I hope that we will finally win again .
&quot; because I don &apos;t know how to taste a victory , &quot; Malmon expects a success experience from his team at the VfL Fredenbeck II .
although the third @-@ league reserve in Fredenbeck has not yet demolished trees , Malmon is warning the finger .
I have trained many players myself in the A youth .
so they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex @-@ coach .
&quot; in addition , it is important to wait to see if there is any reinforcement from the first , &quot; explains SG @-@ Coach .
in order to finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to previous performances .
in particular , it was a great deal of work on cover and switching .
the exploitation of opportunities must definitely be improved .
so I hope my players have finally got their head free during the short break .
security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures
thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique to agree to peace calls during a rare public demonstration .
&quot; we want peace again , we want stability , &quot; said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .
for fear of the country &apos;s future , she exchanged her business clothes for a T @-@ shirt with the inscription &quot; We demand security &quot; in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on the capital &apos;s independence square .
for two weeks , there have been reports almost daily of clashes between government forces and RENAMO , which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .
RENAMO was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by the White @-@ dominated Rhodesia and later by South Africa &apos;s apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country &apos;s independent government .
after the 1992 peace agreement , it became an opposition party .
analysts consider it unlikely that the country will return to an extended conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .
a lot is at stake for the fast @-@ growing economy , because the discovery of huge reserves of gas off the coast and coal farmers in the northwest could bring investment of more than $ 50 billion from companies like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko from the US in the coming years .
the ruling Frelimo Party , the dominant force since 1975 , and RENAMO blame each other for the tensions .
RENAMO claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional stronghold of Renamos , on 17 October .
the attacks on former rebels escalated when government forces attacked RENAMO bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times .
the government blames RENAMO for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .
on Wednesday , he told AFP , the French news agency , that Dhlakama sees himself as a &quot; loser , &quot; who &quot; wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . &quot;
both Frelimo and RENAMO stress that they want to avoid war .
but concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that RENAMO is abandoning the 1992 peace agreement .
he explained to FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement .
&quot; our vision is to resume negotiations and to do so seriously , &quot; said Mazanga .
earlier talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions caused by a series of clashes this year .
&quot; we have here two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who meet the heads , &quot; says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert .
none of them is good at negotiating and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
RENAMO , who is pressing for electoral reform , has already said that she will boycott the local elections in November .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some commentators interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a stifling movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .
Renamos electoral success has shrunk since 1992 , while a newer party , Movimento Democrático de Moçambique ( MDM ) , founded by a former RENAMO member , is likely to improve in the elections .
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country &apos;s democracy .
&quot; he does not want a multi @-@ party democracy , he does not want a transparent election , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , &quot; said Mazanga .
it is unclear what capacity RENAMO has , but it has taken unrest attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North @-@ South link .
most battles took place in the province of Sofala , which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but in which Beira is located , the port , mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal .
in June , Rio stopped using the railways for one month after RENAMO announced an attack on the track .
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether RENAMO would repeat this threat .
RENAMO wanted to &quot; warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , &quot; said Mazanga .
instability has increased frustration with the government , says Fernando Lima , Head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already been worried about corruption , slow progress in development , and a recent wave of kidnapping .
&quot; people think that the government and the president are responsible for the country &apos;s future and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , &quot; he explains .
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .
&quot; no one is interested in RENAMO and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads , &quot; he said .
children should receive myths and legends as &quot; models for life , &quot; says an author .
Thor &apos;s stories showed that &quot; brutal power has no chance against clever tricks , &quot; and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .
however , many of the myths are &quot; far too wild , too offensive , and , in some cases , too dirty to be taught at schools , &quot; which is why Crossley @-@ Holland called for &quot; careful selection &quot; of age @-@ appropriate works .
&quot; I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , &quot; he said .
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .
he added that &quot; overly didactic &quot; authors and teachers would &quot; shut down &quot; children , because in entertaining stories the embassies would be conveyed &quot; underground . &quot;
Crossley @-@ Holland , who translated Beowulf from the Anglo @-@ Saxon language and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales , said : &quot; you can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background . &quot;
perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children lies in the need to convey hope .
not everything must be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .
this must be shown underground , through which history is revealed and not explained .
this is the old story of showing instead of counting .
Hansjakob moves again in FREIHOF
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved to Haslach , on Sunday his last years in the &quot; FREIHOF . &quot;
the many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely short @-@ lived scene game .
from the arrival , to the award of honorary citizenship to his death , the screenwriter and Hansjakobactor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a entertaining piece that received much praise under the direction of Cornelia people .
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a spokesperson with the ten different scenes , explained contexts and bridled periods from youth to approaching retirement .
on October 22 , 1913 Hansjakob returns home to his children &apos;s skies , in his FREIHOF .
and then began the scene game in which Alois Krafczyk once again shines in his paradise as a great son of the city .
he introduced Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with his two @-@ spider and &quot; Black Forest feet . &quot;
he was not only received by the audience with a lot of applause , but his sister Philippine also welcomed him .
Billy Sum @-@ Hermann understood it incredibly well to get involved in the role of the sister and left her in mimics and gestures of immense life .
between the different scenes of the game , the Mühlenbacher Farmband played appropriately selected music pieces and finished the performance .
in order to award honorary citizens , Haslach &apos;s mayor , Heinz Winkler , was honoured to represent the then incumbent , Hättich , along with some of the City Council .
their retaliation then made the three @-@ king singer , who led Hansjakob to the call : &quot; Oh how beautiful , then youth encounters become alive again in my own three @-@ royal age . &quot;
with their song &quot; O Jesulein , &quot; they enjoyed the audience in the FREIHOF as well as the storytellers with their loud &quot; Heraus , Heraus . &quot;
at that time , Hansjakob expressed his criticism of the Church as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war .
in his homeland , behind his tomb chapel on fire at Hofstetten , he found his retirement .
&quot; a restless spirit had finally found its calm and had gone away forever , &quot; he said .
many applause and many laudable words were given by the audience for the performance .
basketball : the Neckar giant &apos;s hope grows
the chances for the leftovers of the sporadically increased Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketballer have increased .
if there is a wildcard procedure , there will be less competitors for the Neckar giants .
the Basketball project Hamburg Towers renounces an application for a possible retrofit place .
&quot; we will not participate in the Wildcard process , &quot; said former national player Pascal Roller , who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in Hanseatic City since 2012 .
a first breath was not heard from Ludwigsburg .
&quot; we did not deal with the Wildcard procedure as long as it is not clear that Düsseldorf does not receive a licence , &quot; said Neckar @-@ Riesen @-@ Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper .
until May 23rd , beginners Düsseldorf Baskets will be able to submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove their economic compatibility .
however , until now the Rhineland has been refused the licence twice .
the arbitration court is the last instance .
Haigerloch : Evening Church focuses on
as a contribution of the city to the 150 @-@ year @-@ old existence of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch , the city &apos;s cultural and tourism office dedicates the last of its public theme tours on Sunday 27 October , the evening meal church .
after the visit to the Atomic Keller Museum , the Haigerlocher loch was to be considered after 1850 when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule .
the crowning end point is a visit to the Abbey Church .
there , the guides tell the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a through and through Catholic territory .
last but not least , there is also a view of the evening meal created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter .

the meeting point for the other half @-@ hour tour is at the Atomic Cell Museum at 3 p.m.
tickets are available at the Cashier of the Atomic Cell Museum .
the Tourist Office of Haigerloch is available for questions and information .
Snowden could also say in Russia
former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US security officer .
representatives of the Federal Public Prosecutor could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30 @-@ year @-@ olds personally in Russia .
the Agency notified Interfax , invoking unspecified circles familiar with the situation .
such an issue could be settled inter @-@ state , it was said .
it is virtually impossible to leave Russia .
&quot; in this case , he loses his refugee status , &quot; the agency quoted its source .
because Germany was an ally of the US , Snowden threatened extradition there , it continued to be said
long Ape pays off
six men &apos;s teams fought for the winning title during the tournament .
in the end , the endurance of Team Maier / Bronner decided the last match .
the tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf had been awarded the tournament of local clubs and friends .
the fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament .
there were five matches per team , each playing against everyone .

enjoy the many old games , such as Schubkarren or Stelzenrun .
speed and coordination are needed here .
for all small detectives , the open @-@ air museum offers a guided tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday , at 12 : 00 and 14 : 00 .
on a course of change , children must guess which stories are true or are lying .
in addition , visitors have a special opportunity to get to know the open @-@ air museum during a carriage ride with black @-@ and @-@ white feet .
not only horses , but also many other animals , such as sheep , goats , cows and chickens , can be found and admired .
in addition , all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday , who will drive his slate bag with the museum guests from 11 a.m.
in the meantime Hermann Büttner is happy and fairy @-@ tale .
the storyteller takes the little guests at 11 , 13 and 15 o &apos;clock into the wonderful world of fairy tales .
in addition , the Gutach children &apos;s dance group will perform traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
furthermore , on both days of events from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. , numerous craftsmen such as the Besenbinder , the Näherin , the Spinnerin , the Weberin and the baker can be seen through the shoulder in their traditional work .
until the end of the summer holidays in Baden @-@ Württemberg , visitors to the open @-@ air museum expect a varied holiday programme .
in a small New Zealand town , Burt Muro is considered to be a beloved cheque , because he plans to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle , 1920 .
in spite of a heart failure , Burt is not responsible for his dream .
with his savings , a few donations , and a mortgage on his old factory posts , he transferred by ship to Los Angeles .
after the film there is coffee , tea and cake .
crippled Piepsen
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land .
they distribute the coal coming from ships to the halves .
the company has several iron in the fire at the site .
apart from coal port , Rhenus Midgard relies , among other things , on wind installations logistics .
black shades the coal in the storage area in front of the dike .
two huge blue semiconductor and rechargeable units distribute or load coal here as necessary .
in every movement of the transshipment devices , a shiny warning device over the terrain .
&quot; the signals serve security and are required by law , &quot; says Matthias Schrell , CEO of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven .
unfortunately , with unfavourable winds , this is widely heard - and there have already been some complaints from people in the town .
he takes the complaints very seriously and therefore contacted the people concerned , says the 40 @-@ year @-@ old .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quiet with technical measures .
he will continue to rely on open dialogue with neighbours .
because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to offer .
with the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge , Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal exports for power plants and is one of the great in Europe in this sector .
thanks to the 18,5 meter @-@ deep sunbathing tub in front of the terminal , Capesize Bulkcarrier can be processed here .
&quot; this year we want to crack the 3 million tonnes mark in the envelope , &quot; says Schrell .
in addition to the on @-@ site Eon power station , imported coal goes to power stations in the inland country .
when the GDF @-@ Suez power plant goes to the grid , a good 5 million tonnes of coal exports per year are realistic .
the three ship passenger loaders on the bridge and the second conveyor could create up to 10 million .
Bayerns Basketballer optimistic despite first defeat
even the first defeat in Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism of FC Bayern Munich basketball players .
&quot; no one can prevent us from believing that we will win against the best team in Europe in the last two years , &quot; Bavaria @-@ Coach Svetislav Pesic , after the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) on Thursday evening at the title defender Olympiakos Piräus .
we sent the message : basketball also exists in Munich !
in their third appearance in the European royal class , Munich sold out very well for a long time , but were simply not clear enough at the decisive stages .
the guests first managed to transform a 15 @-@ point backlog into a guided tour 13 minutes before Piräus gave the game a turning point .
&quot; we fought unbelievably back against the two @-@ legged Euroleague champion , but then again made reckless mistakes , &quot; said Bavaria @-@ Profi Yassin Idbihi .
we are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful advertisers of Munich , who had celebrated clear victories in the first two matches against the Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title carrier Zielona Góra .
Ben Greenman : ten Years New York Comedy Festival : the New Yorker
one might say that New York City is the birthplace of Stand @-@ up Comedy in America : almost a hundred years ago , the variable artist Frank Fay , who worked as Conférencier at the Palace Theatre am Broadway , began to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation .
over the years , Fays &apos;s innovation has been enhanced , as was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival .
launched and led by Caroline Hirsch , founder of the stand @-@ up institution Carolines , this year the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres .
&quot; most of these headliners began with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were known at some point to appear in a club , &quot; said Hirsch .
we have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them .
at this year &apos;s event there are performances by Wanda Sykes , Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher , as well as by &quot; Stand Up for Heroes , &quot; an annual music and comedy charity event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden , which includes Bruce Springsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Watsers and Bill .
with the festival the world of comedy has also grown .
a number of comedians participating in the festival this year have become known about more unconventional ways , such as broadcasts on smaller TV channels such as Comedy Central , FX and Spike .
Nick Kroll became known with a Sitcom on cable TV ( the ironic @-@ sounding fantasy football series &quot; The League &quot; on FXX ) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central .
Jenny Slate was part of the match at &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; and &quot; Parks and Recreation , &quot; although she is best known for her viral video series &quot; Marcel the Shell with Shoes On . &quot;
both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik , the ironic , racial @-@ centred W. Kaumau Bell ) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy .
one of the biggest visitors of the festival is an interview : David Steinberg speaks to Larry David .
Steinberg started as a stand @-@ up comedian , but has become a prestigious television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian .
from 2005 to 2007 , he hosted a TV show entitled &quot; Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg &quot; at TV Land .
the meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan .
&quot; the city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry &apos;s entire work , &quot; said Steinberg .
he told me if he is here , then he sometimes goes through the street between two buildings and thinks : hey , if I lose all my money , then perhaps I live here .
Iran satisfied with the nuclear negotiations process
Iran is showing itself one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN vetoes , and Germany is satisfied with the negotiation process .
&quot; after years , agreement has now been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to address the differences of recent years , &quot;
it would be a long way off , but the nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will eventually reach a solution .
drama in Uruguay : young kill game cameramen with machete
two children admitted the murder of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old in Uruguay .
the two 14 and 12 year old boys had invited their victims to go hunting with them .
armed with machetes and knives , they landed on Tuesday 11 @-@ year @-@ olds and threw the body into a fountain , reported the newspaper &quot; El País &quot; on Thursday .
they would then have played football in front of their homes in a working quarter .
the Leichnam was found on the following night in Cerro Pelado , 15 km north of the exclusive beach resort Punta del Este .
as an alibi , a five @-@ year @-@ old half @-@ sister of the disciple they had taken with them should say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy .
however , when the girl described the day course before the police without mentioning an attack against her , the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the reasons for this was a rivalry in football .
he was temporarily sent to a psychiatric youth hospital .
pimps to jail
the Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33 @-@ year @-@ old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison because of exploitative trafficking , pimping , threatening , insulting and dangerous physical injury .
the former Bundeswehr soldier , who worked as a Turner after two missions in Afghanistan , made a confession in a process .
so , in five cases , he has met women via internet or telephone contacts , which he sent out after a few weeks against her will .
he used resistance to break with violence and threats .
he retained the income of women , some of whom created him for years .
by confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards , he supported women &apos;s contacts with the outside world .
together with a colleague who mediated women , he brought them to various brothels in the southwest .
there , he left them in part to monitor their revenue .
first , the defendant claimed in court that he suffered a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died from an explosion .
after a psychiatric expert suggested a great deal of doubt about the mental constraint , and thus limited guilt , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old made a comprehensive confession .
the court did not hear any of the injured women .
according to a Kripo official , at least four other cases of exploitative trafficking were identified following a first notification by telephone surveillance .
the intermittent talks had been marked by high aggression .
in subsequent consultations , the injured parties would have confirmed their martyrdom .
another witness , in which one of the women had discovered blue spots throughout the body , has not yet made a statement .
it is a question of &quot; a completely broken personality , &quot; which regards violence and exploitation in this sea as normal .
the defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday .
&quot; he had left these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after imprisonment , &quot; he said .
oil price continues to drop down to USD 96 per barrel
oil prices continued to fall on Friday , after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report indicating that China &apos;s energy @-@ intensive manufacturing sector is growing .
in December , Europe &apos;s electronic trading unit in the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 14 cents to $ 96.24 per barrel .
the contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday , which meant a drop in prices of 5.8 % in October .
the large supply of crude oil has affected prices in recent weeks .
the US Department of Energy announced on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .
over five weeks , supply increased by 25 million barrels .
but on Friday , there were indications of increased demand through two reports of increased activity in Chinese manufacturing .
this suggests continued recovery in China &apos;s economy , which grew to 7.8 % in the third quarter , after reaching the lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter .
crude oil from Brent , a reference value for international crude oil , also used by US refineries , fell by 26 cents to $ 108.58 per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London .
Court blocks decision on NYPD &apos;s Stop and Frisk Directive
on Thursday , a Federal Court of Appeal in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had demanded changes to the Stop and Frisk Program ( &quot; Continuing and browsing &quot; ) of the New York Police Department , and withdrew the judge from the case .
the second US Appeal Court declared that Judge Shira Schlüdlin &apos;s decisions would be suspended until the city had been invoked .
in August , the judge ruled that the city was in breach of the Constitution by the way in which the program for stopping and questioning people was implemented .
the city appealed against its assessment and the remedies ordered , including the decision to set up a supervisory body to assist the police in amending its directive and its training programme .
the Appeal Court heard the arguments on the suspension requested on Tuesday .
the Appellate Report stated that the judge had to be relieved of the case , because it had breached the Code of Conduct for US judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality , partly due to a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the Court &apos;s criticism .
the judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the Stop and Frisk programme .
it appointed an external supervisor to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms in directives , training and service supervision , and ordered a pilot programme of cameras on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out .
in August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released again after police control .
an oral hearing to appeal the city is scheduled after 14 March 2014 .
the Stop and Frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of citizens &apos; rights defenders .
controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades , but the number of recorded controls during the term of office of the non @-@ partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg has risen to a total of 684,330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .
in 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities brought an action which became a collective redress .
advocates of changes to the NYPD &apos;s Stop and Frisk program say that the changes will end unfair practices , create a more trustworthy and effective police force , and influence the way other policemen use the regime .
opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morality of the police , but not criminality ; nor would money be wasted and the broader problem of a police force under pressure after thousands of posts have disappeared in the last decade .
the judge pointed out that she did not end the Stop and Frisk practice , which is constitutional , but only the way in which the NYPD implemented controls .
the happiness of the dreaming camels
happiness is an oasis that can only be reached by dreaming camels
the first president , Wolfgang Henne , described the history and fascination of the association &quot; helping hands . &quot;
on Saturday afternoon the tenth anniversary of the association was celebrated , which can already have considerable success .
the first chairman , Henne , reported extensively on the work of the association .
he himself was in the Cheijk @-@ Zajed hospital in Nouakchott for the first time in 2004 .
further cooperation developed as a result , and the gynaecologist Henne performed numerous operations on the ground during several trips .
during the speeches pictures of the interventions were shown on a large screen , so that the guests of the jubilee event could take a picture of the actions mentioned .
the desert vehicle of the association was also shown .
it is a former federal border protection vehicle .
Rainer Prewo , the former OB of Nagold , proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans to work with the association in advisory capacity , according to Henne .
in 2008 , Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim , an elder quarter on the outskirts of the capital .
Henne also mentioned a new mother @-@ child hospital in Nouakchott
especially interesting in times when birth clinics are to be wounded in Nagold .
one learns a lot in Africa as a medical practitioner , Henne said , for example , deportation of Burn @-@ out .
due to the political unrest in the country , it was not possible to travel as many times as planned , but many doctors came to Germany to hover here in various areas .
furthermore , containers containing material are regularly sent to Africa , for example medical equipment , medicines , bandages , hospital beds and glasses in March this year .
co @-@ initiator Hans @-@ Joachim Fuchtel himself supplied plenty of local colorite by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to mobile bricks and describing the experiences of the local musicians who traditionally support the association during their journey to Mauritania .
as his personal motivation , he described his work in auditing as a young MEP .
when he realised how much money was lost on the road , he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people .
moreover , Fuchtel stressed that global economies also demand global love of humanity .
nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think .
from Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa .
Coulson used telephone hacking to check a tip
the former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used &quot; telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation &quot; in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by then @-@ Interior Minister Charles Clarke .
prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained to the Court in the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his &quot; attractive special adviser &quot; Hannah Pawlby .
the paper asked Glenn Mulcaire , the private detective , to hack Pawlbys Voicemails , and followed them , but Coulson also called them and left behind messages , as the court learned .
&quot; according to the Public Prosecutor , Coulson , who is now the editor of the NotW , is no one who stands in front of the home of people and hopes to seize them in a fresh way , but one who likes to face a story to see their reaction , &quot; Edis said .
he said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories investigative : telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .
the publisher is personally involved in the third method .
obviously he knows of the second , the monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .
what about the first ?
do he know about the phone hacking ?
he disputes that , but we say : &quot; and if he knew it . &quot;
rumors about an affair of Clarkes were first taken up by NotW &apos;s feature editor , when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was said : &quot; do not waste your time , it is associated with Charles . &quot;
a band with voicemail from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires flat .
the investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective where Pawlby and her sister were stored as &quot; projects . &quot;
in the time when the searches were conducted , Pawlby &apos;s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them , Edis explained .
meanwhile , former Chefreporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Pawlby &apos;s movements .
on 18 June 2005 Coulson left her with a voicemail with the following content : &quot; I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow , about which I would like to talk to Charles . &quot;
EDIS explained that Coulson &apos;s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities , such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett .
on Thursday , the jury heard that Coulson Blunkett faced a married woman for an affair when he himself was littered with the co @-@ accused Rebekah Brooks , who had been married then .
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have committed themselves to hacking phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted the telephone hacking .
in protest against the planned coup d &apos;état , French football will indeed pass through the first strike since 1972 .
a conciliation meeting will be concluded without results .
in the conflict over the coup d &apos;état , the government and professional football in France , after a failed arbitration meeting , have slipped into a dead end .
President François Hollande received club and association representatives at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and listened to their complaints .
but he refused to squander football from the planned 75 % levy on income of more than one million euros per year , which all the country &apos;s firms will pay from 2014 onwards .
the other side also remained tough .
the strike announced for the end of November will now be passed through , with Jean @-@ Pierre Louvel , Chief of Profiklubs Association ( UCPF ) .
the game days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 start between November 29 and December 2 .
Gechingen : no absolute protection possible
&quot; we want to involve the inhabitants at an early stage in planning , &quot; Mayor Jens Houter opened the Citizens &apos; Information Event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen .
around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and introduce ideas .
Houter made it clear : &quot; the final decisions take the members of the municipal council . &quot;
the floods that hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009 , unprepared , had been a major event that raised the question of safeguards for the future , says Houter .
a river basin inquiry was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .
&quot; protecting as many land as possible is the goal , &quot; says Houter .
according to German weather services , the planning of protection against flooding is based on statistics every 100 years .
climate change is taken into account by a 15 % supplement .
this is called &quot; HQ 100aKlima . &quot;
the water masses , which caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 , amounted to a 1000 year flood .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement can be achieved , &quot; says Houter .
in order to protect HQ 100aClimate , around EUR 4 million will have to be invested in Gechingen , with the municipality expected to receive national subsidies of around 70 % .
Houter pointed out , however , that there would only be support if an overall approach were implemented .
this requires the participation of citizens .
an elaborate planning and authorisation procedure must be completed .
at best , implementation could start in 2016 .
among other things , the concept of protection , which was presented last week in the municipal council ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the stem of the Upper Austria Valley .
following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to raise their concerns .
among other things , it questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place .
Gregor Kühn , expert planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it was necessary to combine all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal .
in addition , one should find the most economical solution , according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe .
resentment prevailed among residents of the old town , who , even with normal storm rain , are constantly suffering from congestion on the canal network .
the problem is well known to the administration and first measures have already been taken .
however , Houter pointed out that the guidelines for Channel Systems were different from those for flood protection and that this should not be mixed .
the municipality is obliged to interpret the network in such a way that two to three years of regenerative events could be overcome .
to scale up the wastewater channels would waste millions .
serious injuries after collision
on Friday afternoon , two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on the state road 44 near Revensdorf .
the police immediately closed the street completely , but could say little about the accident .
however , there are various testimonies that should be evaluated .
it is clear that the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Lenkerin of a VW Golf went to Revensdorf and the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Gettorf man met her with his Hyundai .
both vehicles collided , with the woman being so hard @-@ pressed that the fire brigade took almost half an hour to get them out of the vehicle scrap .
the real cause of the accident was initially unclear .
both wounded came to nearby hospitals .
the track remained closed for about two hours .
he could be called the Dostojewski of the United States .
Philip K. Dick was a god , a metaphor , his novels and narratives also have something serious .
amazingly the relationship in the outside : the steady eyes , the beard , the high forehead .
and just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is to be understood with his massive Oeuvre as the founder and apologet of the Russian soul , Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet , which is certainly true in his own country .
some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag , which sells Haffmans Cassette with the 118 stories .
dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress , coupled with paranoia , safety madness , and the belief that it is chosen .
dick had religious experiences , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , drug addicted to his brain .
he has broken , early that the computers are divinity .
he wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine , the creator of his creature .
this is the Blade Runner problem .
killing .
a Master of Science Fiction .
a fantastic writer .
his stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott , Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &quot; minority report &quot; dates back to 1956 , and it evokes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals .
the principle of &quot; pre @-@ crime , &quot; pre @-@ Crime , &quot; in other words , what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House , is developed here .
in Dicks world , which resembles our frightening , mutants look to the future - and the police are watching .
&quot; we collect individuals who have not breached any law , &quot; says the head of the authority .
&quot; we swallow them before they can commit a violent crime . &quot;
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious criminals , for which we have a strawberry of Pesudoverbrecher . &quot;
they assume that the worst is happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice .
Dick &apos;s narrative works like the blueprint for the anti @-@ terror laws and the NSA &apos;s interception .
anticipating the attack : this is how Obama &apos;s drone philosophy and practice works .
but Dick &apos;s story is not over yet .
the police chief complains that there is no more separation of powers , the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state .
then the watchdog will be monitored and transferred to a future crime .
the system rotates .
it is perfect , but it lies .
it invests its own preconditions .
does not just accept mistakes and sacrifices , but builds on them .
the system creates the threat it is fighting .
reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth .
exclamations about Merkel in Russia
former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US Department of Foreign Affairs for Chancellor Angela Merkel .
representatives of the German Federal Bar could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30 @-@ year @-@ old in Russia personally , the agency Interfax .
prior to that , the Green Bundestag member Hans @-@ Christian Ströbele had met in Moscow yesterday as the first German politician to discuss the affair with him .
NSA revelations reinforce company paranoia over state supervision
on a mild day at the end of August , a German police helicopter flew deep across the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main , Germany &apos;s financial capital .
on the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter @-@ Terrorism ( BVT ) , the German Interior Intelligence Service , he should photograph the roof of the US outpost , which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .
according to German media , the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of speech between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin .
James Clapper , US Director of National Intelligence , once again insisted in September that the US did not use foreign espionage opportunities &quot; to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or profits . &quot;
but since Edward Snowden , the former worker who has become a whistleblower , began to publish his fillings of US surveillance secrets , European governments and business leaders have become unsure whether they can take the director at their word .
reports that the American National Security Agency has spied out the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from American cloud providers , including Google and Yahoo , have brought the company paranoia to a new level because of state surveillance .
the barrel to overflow brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s phone had disappeared , possibly for ten years .
if the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted , then it is certain that corporate governance will also be possible .
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent .
I believe that it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit .
&quot; Germany must wake up , &quot; explains Oliver Grüner , President of BITMi , representing small and medium @-@ sized IT companies in Germany .
German companies believe that the US is now almost as risky as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , according to a survey published by the consultants EY in July .
however , in the documents leaked through by Snowden , there has been no evidence so far that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US .
companies are sceptical about this .
the Bundestag proposed that we should build a German Google .
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly ...
&quot; this is not how it works , &quot; says Hasso Plattner , Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP .
if we had wanted a strong European IT industry , we should not have let it die 20 years ago .
everything in Germany is subsidised , from coal to cars to agriculture .
everything except the IT industry .
nevertheless , the scope and technical refinement of the US spy agencies revealed by the Snowden revelations shocked companies that had previously seen China &apos;s largest spy risk .
cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to jurisprudence and therefore potentially at risk .
according to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance , a commercial institution , around 10 % of non @-@ US members planned to use an American supplier following revelations about US data mining activities with Prism .
Jim Snabe , Deputy Managing Director of SAP , says : &quot; we see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago - where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this legal area ? &quot;
many German business leaders take the view that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew , namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that they must therefore be guarded at all costs .
it is no surprise that economic espionage is taking place .
that has always been the case .
&quot; it has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally due to the current discussion , &quot; says Kurt Bock , Chairman of the chemical company BASF .
the Americans are spying on us at commercial and industrial level , just as we do , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
corporate governance usually does not talk about the counter @-@ measures that have been taken , because that gives benefits to attackers .
in large companies , employees have long been aware that taking a free USB stick at a fair or leaving a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable , to say the least .
Ulrich Hackenberk , Executive Board member of Audi , says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as interception devices .
the German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised .
prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards .
however , there is concern that small and medium @-@ sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance .
in Germany , many of these companies are world leaders in their respective niches .
&quot; small and medium @-@ sized enterprises often lack the experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access , &quot; says BVT in a report .
the US warns its own firms against economic espionage by other countries .
according to Washington Post , in February , in the US National Intelligence Estimate , France , Russia , and Israel rank two of the countries that used to acquire the economic data of hacking .
a member of the board of a German blue chip company agreed to &quot; the worst &quot; when it comes to economic espionage .
Bernard Squarcini , former head of the French internal intelligence service DCRL , was quoted in an interview this month : &quot; the secret services know very well that all countries , even if they cooperate in the fight against terror , spy on their allies . &quot;
Hechingen : trade Fair answers high @-@ speed questions
&quot; marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can undertake , &quot; said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard .
tips on how at least the wedding ceremony succeeds now gave a special exhibition in the domain in Hechingen .
important suppliers were represented around a wedding .
a trend : the retro look has returned .
this begins with wedding dresses .
white is must , best covered or in cream .
at the front , the often rugged clothes with embroidery are closed , often with a veil , but in the back they go down and often end up in a trash .
however , as Stefanie Koch of the fashion house Kleidermüller stresses , ghosts leave .
the suit is dominated by Weste and Plastron , but creamy or brown combinations can also be chosen .
the choice of the place was explained .
the room was very small and the staff were very helpful .
here the domain drew attention to its own offer in Remise .
if you want to go ahead with the carriage , Uwe Link has an offer .
&quot; kutschen is also popular for young people , &quot; he says .
romance is also required for invitations , flower arrangements and wedding pictures .
more and more fashion comes the &quot; After Wedding Photo &quot; - that is , reception holidays in special places , preferably waterfalls , some days after the festival , but in wedding clothing , Elisabeth Keidel explained .

parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accidents believe in murder
the parents of the teenager , whose body was found in a rugged ringermatte in the gymnasium of his high school , are convinced that their son was murdered , explained the family lawyer on Thursday .
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was found on 11 January in a raised mat behind the gallery in the school hall .
the investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , but the 17 @-@ year @-@ old family was in doubt .
&quot; they are convinced that their son was murdered , &quot; explained Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , to FoxNews.com.
they never believed that he died as the Sheriff concluded .
&quot; they believe that there is no logic , contrary to the laws of physics as well as to common sense , &quot; says Crump .
instead , they are convinced that the truth will be concealed to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; her son went to school to learn and came back in the body bag , &quot; he commented .
on Thursday , US prosecutor Michael Moore said that there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johnsons , as a number of important issues remain unresolved .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
this was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .
I follow the facts , whatever direction they take .
my aim is to find out the truth .
&quot; I believe there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , &quot; he said .
Moore explained to Reporters that initially autopsy suggested that Johnson had died of the consequences of &quot; opposition @-@ related stifling . &quot;
however , a second car accident caused another cause of death , Moore said .
&quot; there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , &quot; he said .
Moore added , if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson &apos;s death , that he would instruct the FBI to carry out the investigation .
a representative of County Sheriff &apos;s authority was not ready to comment immediately on our question on Thursday .
a court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities should release all the monitoring videos that the investigators have checked .
the teenager &apos;s parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained indications of how he died .
CDC publishes school allergy guidelines
on Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for dealing with children &apos;s food allergies in schools .
these are the first such guidelines issued by the US administration , as the number of children with food allergies is increasing .
one in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .
according to CDC , the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness among teachers and staff of food allergies and how to deal with children who have allergic reactions .
it is also recommended that schools have Epinephrine in front - the epiPen car injection is used most frequently - to counter a potentially deadly hypersensitivity reaction .
legislators in the federal states have recently amended the rules to make it easier for schools to hold Epinephrin .
the report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with allergic reactions .
children may say : &quot; it feels like something is pressing on my tongue , &quot; &quot; My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it &quot; or &quot; My tongue cribs . &quot;
parents of Intersexual Children can choose &quot; sex undetermined &quot;
Germany is the first European nation to recognise a third gender for children born with unclear genitals .
newborn babies are no longer assigned rigidly male or female .
under the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but can specify &quot; undefined &quot; or &quot; not defined &quot; on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents , so that they do not have to take hasty decisions regarding sexual allocation operations in newborn children , and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .
an intersexual person said , according to BBC years later , &quot; I am neither man nor woman . &quot;
I stick to the patchwork created by doctors , mutilated and full of scars .
it is estimated that one in 2,000 children are neither young nor girls .
they are among the intersexuals , a group that is covered by the diagnosis of &quot; sex differentiation disorder &quot; ( DSD ) , a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , germs ( ovaries or trousers ) , or unusually developed genitals .
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .
the understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most US experts suggest that the best available gender information should be used if a provision is not possible , rather than waiting for the child &apos;s psychological and physical development before deciding , if any , on an operation .
the New York Psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in the issue of gender identification , said that the new German law &quot; blade after good cause . &quot;
intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .
&quot; some people have life @-@ threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not , &quot; he said .
you can do a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops .
scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity is not very accurate .
nobody knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret why people are homosexual .
a report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexual people must be distinguished from transsexuals or transgender persons , because their status is not gender @-@ based , but due to their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female , but typically defines both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them .
these characteristics were reflected in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , body , breasts and stature , primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or chromosomal structures and hormones .
the report also provides an overview of the discrimination suffered by inter @-@ sexual and transgender persons in professional life and the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice .
boys not in line with the gender picture now have a special camp .
it is now possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate male , female or third sex on official documents .
in June , Australian Norrie May @-@ Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world &apos;s first &quot; gender @-@ free &quot; person after a court granted life @-@ long retention of &quot; undefined &quot; gender status .
in addition to M and W , German cards will have a third assignment , X for intersexually , according to the Ministry of the Interior .
in neighbouring France , gender issues are still controversial , according to a news report on France 24 .
in 2011 , dozens of French members of the severely Catholic country signed a petition to remove &quot; gender theory &quot; from school books .
the US site Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law on the grounds that &quot; if the world is broken up into a new state where gender is a choice , but not sexual activity , then we are turning two more pillars of civilisation . &quot;
the mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to baby zone that they would do better if babies were assigned a sex at birth .
&quot; parenthood is stressful enough without further restrictions , especially if you don &apos;t know the sex of your child , &quot; she said .
children need stability and security .
historically , children born with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodites , according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes .
ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something that could be extinguished and then rebuilt .
but now the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned , now that it is known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong , because they do not know how the child feels when they grow up with the gender they assign .
&quot; in the mid @-@ twentieth century this was called a &quot; psychiatric emergency , &quot; said Drescher .
when such a child was born , it was called not the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .
the ruling theory of treatment of children with undefined genitals is based on Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University , who argued that gender is formable .
he shaped the term &quot; gender identity , &quot; arguing that social and environmental attacks - how parents educate a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child , shaping whether a person considers himself male or female .
but in a case that became known as &quot; John / Joan &quot; in 1966 , his theories became controversial .
he told the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from a mutilated circumcision , to cut the child completely and also to remove his trousers and then raise him up as a girl .
&quot; money presented this case as a successful example of transformation , but it was not , &quot; said Drescher .
when the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married a woman .
with 38 but he committed suicide .
according to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .
but in the 1990 &quot; s , with the advent of the Internet , survivors of these sexual operations became public , &quot; unhappy with the result . &quot;
for example , Jim Bruce , a 36 @-@ year @-@ old Montana author born with XY male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .
doctors were not clear whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a &quot; satisfactory life &quot; as a man .
so his external organ and the trousers were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 , and he was raised up as a girl .
at the age of 12 he received female hormones .
&quot; I knew I am not a girl , &quot; he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .
but , knowing that something was wrong , he demanded his medical files .
what he found out was shocking .
I was sterilised at my birth - and nobody ever told me .
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals .
after learning the truth , he returned to the male identity , received testosterone injections , and allowed his breasts to be removed .
the operation has made it infertile .
today , he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to ensure that intersexual people are perceived as normal .
but Anne Tamar @-@ Mattis , Managing Director of the California @-@ based Advocates for Informed Choice legal group , is concerned that the German law can &quot; encourage stamps and stigma . &quot;
&quot; many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to take quick decisions and &quot; assign &quot; the child to the child , she said .
we fear that this will favour intervention .
we think it would be better to allocate the male or female sex and then wait .
but we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .
Tamar @-@ Mattis said her organization supports Australian law , because &quot; it allows adults to be recognised as a third sex . &quot;
she said .
the German law is about attribution at birth .
this is not a fight at which small children should be forced at this time .
when they grow , they can decide their own body .
but Dr. Arlene Baratz , a quagmire scientist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and who supports hundreds of others in a self @-@ help group , says that the German law &quot; authorises &quot; both parents and children .
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete androgenic resistance .
because of the recipe defect of the target cells for testosterone , Katie developed female characteristics .
she has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .
today Katie is 29 and married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry .
although it is infertile , it hopes to get a child through adoption or surrogate mother .
&quot; the law gives parents room , so they do not have to take decisions overly , &quot; Baratz said .
it gives them time to make different tests and clarify things and gives them time to write &quot; male &quot; or &quot; female . &quot;
in this way , everything is fine - you pull the child big and love it .
you have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parenthood .
and you do not have to do an operation that can no longer be reversed .
&quot; this includes children in the decision and removes the fear that parents are driving around because they think they are not doing the right thing , &quot; she explained .
ultimately , the child decides on the gender that suits him better - and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to make the decision themselves .
unknown injured girls by shooting out of cars
unknown people have injured a 12 @-@ year @-@ old in Saxony @-@ Anhalt in the case of bulk cars .
on Thursday evening in Genthin , the perpetrators probably fired a group of children with an air force .
that was what the police told in castle .
the girl was easily injured on the left .
rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .
the shot came from a small car that passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpetrators also shot at a bus stop .
a disc collapsed .
they then learned .
the criminal police were identified on Friday .
until now , the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night .
the officials were only called twice to work children who attacked domestic fibres .
since the homeowners recognized this in good time and the most distant one , no material damage should have arisen .
in addition , some Sylvesterböller may have been ignited in the city area , but no material damage has been caused here either .
a resident of the Bishop @-@ Freerorfer @-@ Weg reported that his car was wrapped in a cloister paper and his bicycle blades were turned away .
until the police arrived , however , the man found all his cyclists in the immediate vicinity , so the police did not need to act .
living with a future
in fact , Waltraud Ries lives wonderfully .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green , old trees , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .
the city is just a few minutes by public transport .
&quot; I hope you don &apos;t fear spinning ? , &quot; Waltraud Ries asks and points to a fat spider on the door frame .
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .
but you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .
the reason , however , is not spinner phobia , but the concern that , at age , the many steps to the house and the apartment will no longer be able to cope with .
moreover , since a Meniscus operation , the mediator has had to learn at his own pace what it means to move from Stockwerk to Stockwerk .
recently a book of her has appeared on the theme &apos; Congratulations living in old age - what type of living is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos;Our apartment is the best example of what doesn &apos;t go at all &apos; , she starts to tell .
when she moved with her husband to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today with middle fifty Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it .
she also knows , however , that she is one of the few people who deal with the subject of living in old age .
most of them crowd it as long as it goes .
old are always only the others , &apos; she says snuggling .
only when the pain pressure is really great , do you think .
&apos;then it can be too late , &apos; says Ries .
in her book , the interior designer presents 17 living models for a self @-@ determined living in age .
&apos;whichever form of residence you choose is always an individual choice &apos; she explains .
d i e solution is not for age .
even those who can afford the old @-@ age residence in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that he could become ill .
and : &apos; without a good knowledge of the national language , one can think in the Dolce Vita , &apos; the specialist bookmaker of expatriates .
among their models are classic models of care , alternative forms of housing or the often quoted pensioners &apos; WG .
at age , everyone has their Ticks and Macks
&apos;For me , such a community would be nothing &apos; , she says with an eye binder .
not like in a student WG with a shared bathroom and kitchen .
&apos;at age you just need to have your retreat rooms &apos; , Ries said .
nevertheless , the book author does not want to rule out the fact that a seniors &apos; community can function .
this must then be different from the classical student WG .
and sometimes you just want to rest , &quot; she believes .
it is not alone in this view , at least in the capital city .
&apos;Most of the old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible &apos; is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of civic services life at the age of the provincial capital .
your office advises people around the subject of becoming older .
that is why elderly people , in particular , would often accept inconvenience and restrictions just to stay in their familiar environment , and that is the experience of the Warentest Foundation .
today there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible .
Ries recommends that anyone who deals with the age @-@ appropriate conversion of their house or apartment should first find out thoroughly and not order the first craftsman .
today there are also specialists for the age @-@ appropriate conversion .
even in the rental apartment one or two can be realized , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior designer clarifies .
but it is not always possible to redesign the existing apartment in an age @-@ appropriate manner and thus without barriers , even if it is so beautiful .
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience .
there was no lift in the room .
she will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband .
before moving , she is greeted more than she is at her home .
us to continue prosecuting Snowden
the US has not changed its position as former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden .
he continues to be accused of unauthorised disclosure of secret information .
as a result , he had to face criminal proceedings in the US , said Jennifer Psaki , US Secretary of State spokesperson in Washington .
nor would Snowden &apos;s recent statements change that .
prior to that , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , German Green politician Hans @-@ Christian Ströbele called on the US to stop threatening him with punishment .
Psaki stressed that there was a stream of statements by a parliamentarian rather than by a German government member .
in principle , the secret service publisher Edward Snowden is ready to talk to the German authorities .
first , however , he wants his situation to be clarified .
this was made clear by the former US @-@ sought NSA staff in a non @-@ addressed letter published by Green politician Hans @-@ Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government , Bundestag and the Federal Prosecutor General .
the text of the letter is as follows :
to those responsible
I have been asked to write to you about your inquiry into mass surveillance .
I am Edward Joseph Snowden and I was previously a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .
in the course of my work in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government , which led me to act through moral duty .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , I have been exposed to a serious and persistent tendency to leave my family and home .
I live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .
citizens around the world , and also high officials - including the United States - have judged revelations to be a system of overarching surveillance that is accountable to no one as a service to the public .
these espionage revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously covert abuse of public confidence .
the benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear , while risks acquired have been deliberately reduced .
although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a fidelity and seeks to criminalise and prosecute political expression .
nevertheless , saying the truth is not a crime .
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will adopt this harmful attitude .
I hope that , when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved , I will be able to participate appropriately and legally in the responsible clarification of the facts relating to the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .
I look forward to hearing with you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for your efforts to respect international law , which protects us all .

kindergarten has found a private buyer
&quot; the building is in good hands , &quot; says Winterlingen &apos;s mayor Michael Maier .
the former kindergarten in the garden street has been sold to a private person .
at its recent meeting , the Council agreed to the sale in the non @-@ public sector .
the building changed its owner at a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the community is satisfied , &quot; says Maier .
the budget was set at EUR 100 000 .
it is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten .
the mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and thus no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house , like heating , looking for the garden and clearing the walk .
&quot; this effort is now gone , &quot; Maier is pleased .

report : Obama campaign to replace Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama &apos;s closest advisers , secretly , have considered replacing Vice @-@ President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton , according to the New York Times .
the revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long @-@ awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign , &quot; Double Down : game Change 2012 . &quot;
the Times has a copy of the upcoming book , and she reported on Thursday evening that the president &apos;s top advisers had conducted &quot; extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 &quot; to find out whether Obama &apos;s waning hope of re @-@ election would be better off if he left Biden to fall .
according to Jonathan Martin , Times National Political Correspondent , the book thoroughly tracks the story of the efforts of leading campaign and White House staff , notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect it has on the poll values that former Secretary of State Clinton has exchanged with the Vice @-@ President .
the potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .
only half a dozen of the president &apos;s closest advisers - including Daley , Obama &apos;s former campaign leader , Jim Messina , and former White House chief adviser David Axelrod , and David Plouffe - knew about the planned change .
&quot; double Down &quot; claims that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange bids , despite their &quot; close , personal relationship , &quot; before eventually deciding against such a move , after the data showed that Clinton &apos;s candidacy &quot; would not significantly improve Obama &apos;s chances . &quot;
in an interview with Martin Daley , Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .
&quot; I said a whole series of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , &quot; Daley explained to the magazine .
we must remember that the President had terrible survey values then , so we thought : &apos; for God &apos;s will , what are we doing ? &apos;
while Daley described the investigations as &quot; necessary care , &quot; Martin said to CNN Anderson Cooper that during the re @-@ election campaign considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a train was paying off in terms of the ballot box .
&quot; in campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups unless you seriously think about something , &quot; Martin said .
but it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange .
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his boss at the time knew about the potential change .
while Daley stated that he did not believe that the president was &quot; aware &quot; of the possible change , the former chief of staff admitted that it was &quot; possible &quot; for Obama to know .
Martin added that &quot; Double Down &quot; did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama &apos;s writing table had reached the political explorations .
Cooper asked Martin whether he was serious about Obama not knowing anything about whether Biden should be dropped in the elections .
&quot; possible , &quot; Martin replied .
what happens on the way with my email ?
e @-@ mail actually means electronic letter .
has e @-@ mail , like conventional mail , been technically implemented in the design of the Internet service ?
when designing the early Internet services , the focus was on making communication possible .
therefore , the basic technical protocols have not taken care to create a stable foundation for an listening safe exchange of letters .
therefore , a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .
if user &quot; Anna &quot; sends an email to &quot; Benni , &quot; are the computers of the two connected directly ?
in the first step , Anna &apos;s email program or browser sends the mail to its service provider &apos;s mail server .
for example , if she has a GMail account , that would be Google .
this mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses .
on the route , the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet .
Bennie can then call the content at his provider .
are conventional e @-@ mails being read on their way through the network ?
most mails are read by software robots on the way .
the sender &apos;s provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an appendix .
a virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems .
in addition , providers check whether this is an annoying and unsolicited spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted out into a spam folder .
do robots have another task ?
for systems like GMail , the robot also detects the information that Google needs to place context advertising .
when Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip , Google may contain links to holiday offers .
do unknown people also read e @-@ mails ?
the likelihood that unauthorised people will read an email is extremely low .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .
law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal means to intercept or take note of e @-@ mails .
this includes possible illegal late @-@ night actions .
is it possible to protect e @-@ mails against reading ?
encryption according to the OpenPGP standard can be used to encrypt an e @-@ mail against reading .
with great technical effort it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e @-@ mail communication so that it is not even possible to recognize who has communicated with whom .
how important are Yahoo and Google on the e @-@ mail market in Germany ?
according to a survey by Convios Consulting in August 2013 , Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mostly privately used postmen .
while the shares of Yahoo @-@ Mail were last down , GMail could significantly increase Google &apos;s share .
mother in the Forest and Mixed pensions
when his brave mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .
he welcomed the dead in a forest - and continued to earn their pensions and care money .
a 67 @-@ year @-@ old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations .
first , he concealed the death of the 89 @-@ year @-@ old , then he had spent more than a year and a half .
now the 67 @-@ year @-@ old has to answer for fraud , as a spokesman said on Friday .
so the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .
the man was already suspected in May : at that time , it became apparent that no medicines were needed for the maternal needy .
the pensioner told the investigators that his mother went to Spain .
because the officials were curious about this , they continued to investigate it .
it emerged that the two had lived in a common flat for more than 15 years and he had last looked after them .
the 67 @-@ year @-@ old finally admitted the death of his mother .
according to the police , an obduction did not indicate a capital crime .
do you want ice cream that shines in the dark ?
a British entrepreneur has developed the first glittering ice in the dark - using qualls .
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the seaweed and created a brilliant delicacy .
the idea came to him after reading a research work on quals and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein .
the ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue , raising the pH value in the protein and triggering the light .
Chris explains that the ice is reacting to the warmth in the mouth and shine - so the more you lick , the more it becomes lighter .
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company &quot; Lick Me I &apos;m Delicious , &quot; says : &quot; the product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . &quot;
the protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .
when the mouth warms the protein , the pH value rises and the ice lights up .
we have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream I &apos;ve ever produced , because the source of glue is four times more expensive than gold .
every ball costs me about GBP 140 .
but it tastes delicious .
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes , including beer , cheese , beef and leaf gold .
but his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .
he says : &quot; I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . &quot;
this is impossible in itself because of the light crushing caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream , but I suspect we find a way to make it .
the ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a torque artificially produced by Chinese scientists
the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association after six days of play .
the team of Ingo Ehlers will be the Derby against the TSV Daverden tomorrow , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .
with this game the season begins again for us .
&quot; I hope that we finally have our heads free , &quot; Ehlers is optimistic .
at last , with the exception of the permanent wounded Hendrik Blohme , he has at his disposal his complete cadre .
also , as we do , we are betting on tempo games .
we must therefore keep our error rate low .
first and foremost , however , we must increase the coverage , which has left nothing but a certain impression .
Daverden &apos;s Coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn .
the game was of course a house number .
but that &apos;s why we are far from being the favorite , because everything can always happen in Derby .
however , Panitz now wants to deposit in Morsum to start a series .
Jan @-@ Malte Jodat will be missing .
for this purpose , the A @-@ Jugend Joost Windßüt , who is active in the A @-@ Jugend @-@ Bundesligisten HC Bremen , celebrates his season debut .
those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .
Halloween 2013 : figures
when I was small , Halloween had something magical .
my sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and dress up for the neighborhood .
today I have become a Halloween muffle .
in the last two years , I have not agreed to distribute from my home from sweets , and I am not going to do so this year .
but , according to statistics , I am a black sheep in Halloween .
the majority of Americans - 158 million to be precise - celebrate Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Association of Retailers ( NRF ) .
one thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend .
the costumes will amount to about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .
this year , exciting , inanimate objects are the last cry .
women no longer have to dress in sexy clothes , they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .
as far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the Daft Punk puppies will make it into the Instagram feeds this year .
according to Google , the most sought after costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition .
we dressed our dogs last year and we were not alone , to my surprise .
indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costume for their pets , according to the NRF .
these are a lot of hot dogs .
as far as sweets are concerned , we are not decidedly .
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielsen Company .
this is about 270 million kilograms of chocorus , limbs , bonbons and rubber bears .
so good news for the 41 million people , according to the US Department of Commerce , who are pulling through the quarter with the phrase &quot; sweetness or saures . &quot;
in fact , we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - let us not delude ourselves - eat .
the only thing we do not want to consume is the sweet Candy Corn , yet 15 million kilograms are sold for Halloween , according to the National Association of confectionery producers .
that is about nine billion corn grains .
it is a mystery that I have not yet been able to resolve .
nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it spurs .
they have great names such as &quot; Terror Disabled the Walls &quot; ( which , incidentally , is in a real prison ) , &quot; Howl @-@ O @-@ Scream &quot; and &quot; The House of Shock . &quot;
there are , in fact , 1,200 officially recognized Spukhäuser in the United States , which generate $ 500 million in revenue , according to America Haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos on which you are poured into the pants and then put friends on Facebook where you will not get rid of them again , and one of the types on which you leave a nice comment . &quot;
but let us finally get to the pumpkin .
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the great pumpkin when we were children , and cutting a pumpkin sole is like decorating the Christmas tree - something we made from small to medium .
fortunately , the &quot; baby in the pumpkin &quot; trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest , so that most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it .
this year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkin , according to the US Census Bureau .
the pumpkin guns that slowly rotate in the foreground are probably from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested this year .
if you want to make the right points , then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut something out of their 921 kilo pumpkin .
housing fire in Helmbrechts : rescue forces provide oiled corpse
the fire brigade had to leave late on Thursday evening in Helmbrechts .
a DREIFAMILIENHAUS in the Landkreis Hof starts fire at night .
the rescue forces leave the house with a stolen body .
in a fire in Helmbrechts , rescue forces found a stolen corpse in a DREIFAMILIENHAUS .
whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said .
on the late Thursday evening it burnt on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire brigade arrived , the flames took off a window .
the forces went to the apartment and found the corpse in a room .
this and another room completely burnt out .
the entire ground floor was damaged .
all other residents were not at home during the run , the police officer continued .
the building was no longer habitable for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was initially unclear .
Germany &apos;s largest national church has launched a revelation vegetarian to promote the profession of the pastor .
background is a possible lack of parish : the Evangelical @-@ Lutheran Church in Hanover expects the number of its currently approximately 1,800 pastors to halve by 2030 .
for today &apos;s young people , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .
it is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily process itself .
with Burfien , the Landeskirche has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full capacity to inspire young people for the theologium .
at present , fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduation .
Burfien takes this back to the process of de @-@ ecclesiasticism : &quot; God &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud . &quot;
the profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .
I am the master of my schedule and can set my priorities where I think it is important .
pastors could be very close to humans as saithe .
they earned as much as teachers and could live well on it .
certainly , more is being paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer .
this comes across to the young people of today , who are not only concerned with careers , but also with a full @-@ time job .
according to the State Church , which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors are retiring each year .
at the same time , about 40 graduates of a theologian start their vikariat .
in the future , it may be difficult to fill jobs in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as Harz , Emsland or Wendland .
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology .
the theologium offers a broad education .
you can even become a federal president .
country Rover Rally Series announced
in the interior there are racing seats and six @-@ point belts as well as a free press system .
the options range from increased brakes , a service package with the support of Bowler @-@ Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .
Drew Bowler , CEO of Bowler Motorsport , says : &quot; the Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . &quot;
they are not all experienced cyclists , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world class events .
we are pleased to open this route in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the Strapazen and the reality of Rally Raid .
we really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - this will be a fun championship .
in addition , the Defender Challenge offers a training and test day in February and the option to take part in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .
a fire brigade called to save a bunch of hunters , 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous cliff in a quarry
Cockerspaniel @-@ Hündin Ruby went off after a minor accident
three days later , she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her dire position .
fire fighters cut off on rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
the fire brigade managed to bring a spider into safety that was fixed on a 15 @-@ metre high lead in a rock wall .
the nine @-@ month @-@ old Cockerspaniel @-@ Hündin Ruby had gone out on Sunday afternoon after a traffic accident and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday .
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 of which the dog belongs , came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to receive Ruby and thank the fire fighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .
they had desperately searched for their missing bitch and published helpers on social networks when they had escaped into the quarry after the small traffic accident .
about 14 : 15 on Wednesday , a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded ruby on the 15 @-@ metre high paragraph in the quarry .
the Cleckheaton Fire Station &apos;s technical rescue team rushed to the spot and departed to rescue Rubys , who was then transported up in a dog box .
Andy Clayton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : &quot; she was in a dangerous position .
it was located in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and the bottom .
she did not move a muscle during her rescue - she was like stiffened .
but now it is doing well .
she then eaten a few dog cups .
that was a rather unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
Peter Lau , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : &quot; Ruby had a giant accident . &quot;
it was possible that it was very seriously injured or worse .
Ruby was brought to the examination of a veterinarian who , apart from exhaustion and stretching , found nothing .
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : &quot; watching the rescue was frightening . &quot;
I could not believe that she really was up there .
it was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .
the veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed , it would probably have fallen .
fire fighters have done great things .
it was really courageous what they did .
we are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .
Scott Alderson , out of cowardly , added : &quot; we were afraid that she would fall , but she stayed above . &quot;
the firemen were great .
I can hardly believe where it was .
Mick Jagger explains that he never did Katy Perry when she was 18 .
during an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said that she had been a background singer at Jagger &apos;s song &quot; Old Habits Die Hard &quot; from 2004 .
Perry explained that she had eaten with the Altrocker evening and that &quot; he gave me inclination when I was 18 . &quot;
she added : &quot; this was a long time ago and he was very kind to me . &quot;
in a statement , a representative of Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he &quot; categorically denied that he had ever made attempts to approximate Katy Perry . &quot;
the representative added : &quot; maybe she confused him with someone else . &quot;
Perry was one of the singers who attended the Rolling Stones Tour this year .
her new album &quot; Prism &quot; landed at number 1 this week .
George Kerevan : European unbundling gives Scots the choice
a new day , a new horror story about independence .
this time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .
this provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a tiled @-@ wire border along the Hadrian Wall .
indeed , the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the potential economic benefits that more freedom of movement would bring in the rest of Europe , but , as expected , this did not matter in the headlines .
nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often turn their tight rules on when it is cheaper for them .
since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area , continued non @-@ compliance with Brussels would be a small concession in return for what the Scots really want .
so no story .
and one that has come so far in the years that it already resembles a fossil : the first time I heard the &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; - at least 40 years ago .
an interesting point is lost in the constant recovery of this ancient history .
why expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe ?
why exchange the London yoke against Brussels , especially now ?
this is the real European news : the great post @-@ war plan to unite Europe has stalled .
with the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .
parties across the EU are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency .
even in Germany , the Euroskeptic party Alternative for Germany - founded only this year - was able to win almost five million votes in the Bundestag elections in September , effectively driving free democrats out of the Bundestag .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .
but the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point .
because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , combined with the straitjacket into which the national economy is forced by adherence to the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .
the euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits - that was only the case in Greece .
instead , the Eurosystem has fixed its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters - and German politicians like to let that happen .
without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern Europe finds itself with a built @-@ in productivity disadvantage vis @-@ à @-@ vis Germany .
the only way is to cut wages and public spending - encouraged by Berlin .
behind the current euro and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem .
as a result of the &quot; green &quot; energy directives imposed by Brussels - a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry pays double for electricity and four times for gas compared with the United States .
this is a smiling cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .
all wage fixing in the world does not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .
as a result , there is a revolt , especially in France , the former EU leader .
after the war , France &apos;s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris on an equal footing with Washington .
but Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed Europe into its own economic policy , with the French economy struggling .
as a result , Marine Le Pen &apos;s right @-@ wing , anti @-@ EU National Front has just won a decisive post @-@ election , placing the ruling socialists on top of three .
the National Front is now the most popular party in France , with 24 % of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that partitioning on the right would automatically bring benefits to the left .
what does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French working class ?
it wants to use next year &apos;s EU elections to forge an anti @-@ EU anti @-@ Community currency bloc in the European Parliament .
if the anti @-@ EU parties do well in these elections - and this is very possible - then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament .
that is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will unite to abolish the euro .
the EU will not disappear , but it will be more like the Europe of ( sovereign ) nations that General de Gaulle favoured .
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may be stuck with the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of avoiding the US .
but Washington &apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain alone will be in Atlantic rain .
where is Scotland in all this ?
we can decide to be a region of ( in the end ) Little England .
or we can defend our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can find themselves in .
I suspect Scotland could do well in a looser European alliance if we retain our own currency .
cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non @-@ federal Europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider equating Norway and maintaining our economic independence .
the SNP government in Scotland has - remarkably - won the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory @-@ Lib Dem coalition .
it would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now , only to be forced into austerity by Berlin and Brussels .
early puberty : faster growth
Afro @-@ American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than white age cooperatives , as studies show .
physical changes do not directly mean puberty
there is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty
the trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among boys
the former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialized in child health and family issues .
should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and shamhairs at the age of seven or eight ?
at the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando , Florida this week , the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard .
&quot; I spend a lot of time calming parents - usually this is no sign that puberty is now fast , &quot; Kaplowitz explained .
obvious signs of development , such as growing breasts , shrubs and arms , as well as body smell , appear earlier in girls .
however , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menace ( occurrence of the first regular blood ) in the last 40 years .
in the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .
&quot; when the development of the breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years until the Menarche , &quot; said Kaplowitz , also author of the book &quot; Early puberty in girls : the essential adviser for dealing with this frequently occurring problem . &quot;
time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .
what is actually the beginning of puberty is controversial , but it is &quot; premature &quot; when the breast increase is accompanied by an eight @-@ year growth boost .
in most cases , the process is slowing down or stagnating - something that a paediatrician can monitor closely .
if more rapid progress is made , tests may be displayed by an endikronologist so that serious problems such as tumour or cyst can be excluded .
there are treatments to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence : the premature ageing of bones , which can ultimately lead to growth and thus small body growth among adults .
the recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the development speed , the growth rate and emotional maturity .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs , but he admits : &quot; suppressing puberty can alleviate the behavioral problems and feelings of girls , unlike being their age cooperatives . &quot;
the other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .
&quot; they worry about pregnancy risk or how they handle the hygienic side , &quot; said Kaplowitz .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; a woman whose daughter got her days with ten .
although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was emotionally unprepared .
she came frightened and excited from school home because she was the first in her circle of friends .
there are many widely published theories about the causes of premature puberty .
but there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media are responsible .
young people come into puberty like girls before .
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .
he supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged between six and nine who are linked between body fat and puberty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .
in that country , Afro @-@ American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than white age cooperatives .
there are different explanations for this .
global seems to be influenced by all sorts of things , from economic conditions to the climate to the genes .
another puzzle : although boys grow face and shame earlier , the trend towards a full @-@ fledged past puberty is not as strong as girls .
other doctors at the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the issue .
the appearance of acne and shamhaar is common even among babies and infants .
&quot; we must be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty , &quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a paediatric endocrine at Goryeb Children &apos;s Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .
parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician how to talk to their child .
&quot; this can mean that you have to talk earlier than expected , &quot; says Kaplowitz .
if you stay calm , the child usually responds well .
girls who flock early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than thought .
Jumbo manufacturers dispute large orders over seat width
between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been a dispute over the breadth of seats in the tourist class on long @-@ haul flights , which is the tone for a bitter clash at Dubai Airshow this month .
the dispute revolves around the number of seats offered to passengers on long journeys in the tourist class - not always those who are most concerned about the airlines , but this designated space is the key to the efficiency of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .
this week , Airbus called for an industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 &quot; ) in the tourist class , but the US Archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide .
the dispute comes at a time when aircraft builders are competing to sell even larger versions of their two @-@ engine long @-@ haul aircraft and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November .
the shape of the rear part of the aircraft - especially if there are nine or ten seats - is crucial for the economic results that the new &quot; mini @-@ jet &quot; design should deliver .
Boeing claims that its modernized &quot; 777X &quot; fiber 406 people are in the tourist class , which is more than 17 inches wide , allowing ten per row .
Airbus declares that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 passengers in 18 @-@ inch seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .
aircraft giants often share hiebe with technical details through advertising in the specialist press .
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public at the Dubai Airshow , where 777X is expected to make the race with more than 100 orders .
recently , the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war , showing donors an image in which three people are sitting in a restaurant , entitled &apos; would you accept that ? &apos;
&quot; Boeing proposes long @-@ haul flights in Sitzen that are closer than regional Turbo @-@ Props , &quot; says Airbus Sales Director John Leahy .
in view of changed dietary habits , people are getting thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .
between the early 1970 &quot; s , when the Boeing 747 defined modern long @-@ haul travel , and at the end of the century , the weight of the male average American increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , according to US Department of Health data .
according to US health statistics , the male average American &apos;s failure range in the 21st century is 100,8 cm .
Airbus says that its rivals are in line with a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average body size of the freshly flown jet set was narrower .
Airbus has carried out investigations showing that an additional duty ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increases sleeping quality by 53 % .
Boeing denies Airbus &apos; figures on the size of the seats and says that it is not up to the manufacturers to decide how airlines balance air fares and facilities .
the company also declares that , according to research , the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width .
&quot; it really means giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful , &quot; explains Kent Craver of Boeing .
they do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .
they know their business better than anyone else .
passengers are more free from elbow , but it is becoming increasingly an issue for manufacturers that can affect sales .
behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or European export balance .
as Reuters reported for the first time in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle over the new jets .
both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two @-@ engine long @-@ haul designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365 @-@ seat Boeing 77 @-@ 300ER .
the statements made by Boeings on the results partly depend on the 777X being compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .
the increased cost per unit is still lower than for currently used machines with 10 seats per row .
&quot; Boeing therefore flies more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive in our products , &quot; says Kevin Keniston , Head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus .
on the other hand , analysts , full cabins with 10 seats per row on existing 777s indicated that many passengers chose a closer arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .
&quot; eighteen customs seats would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is driven by the threat posed by the 777 , &quot; says Mary Kirby , expert in cabin equipment , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose .
the world @-@ leading jet vendors even carry bandwidth to measure the equipment in competition .
even if they praise the comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with a highly condensed design for low @-@ cost airlines and regional flights .
Airbus has a ten @-@ seat A350 but has not yet sold .
until recently , Airbus stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats to some jets .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to puzzle , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .
new anti @-@ nicotine vaccine could make smoking a success .
scientists have developed an anti @-@ nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .
a single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life .
before human testing , further tests are needed , which may take several years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .
&quot; we are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop using all the methods available on the market , but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , &quot; said Cornell .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information to produce nicotine antibodies .
the virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a constant stream of antibodies .
the antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , leaving a smoker without a nicotine high .
in experiments , vaccinated mice , to which Nikotin was given , maintained its normal level of activity .
by contrast , mice without vaccination would have taken a &quot; break @-@ out , &quot; the researchers said , a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain .
the experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine .
earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .
the vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .
but the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody perfabria .
as Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for people who are safe could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , thereby preventing nicotine addiction .
more likely , smokers would use it to stop .
&quot; they then know : when they start smoking again , they no longer feel pleasure because of nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to leave the habit , &quot; he explains .
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but they warned that further research was needed .
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid
an investigation is under way against former Minister Joe Tripodi of New South Wales , the Labor Party &apos;s former minister .
the former NSW minister denied that he had changed the rules on martial lease at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid , who had covert shareholdings in three land on state @-@ controlled land .
on Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC ) extended its investigations into whether Obeid influenced various ministers of state to extend lease contracts at Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café , without a call for tenders after their expiry in August 2005 .
it is now being investigated for the accusation that Tripodi was interested in the land by Obeid , after Tripodi &apos;s former deputy chief Lynne Ashpole had said so on Thursday .
in years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pressed for public tenders for lease contracts .
the guards opposed it and wanted longer maturities .
in 2009 , the lease contracts for Circular Quay companies , which contributed $ 2.5 million annually to the Obeids , were extended without a public tender .
Tripodi , who was Minister of Port from February 2006 to November 2009 , originally called for public tenders .
but he argued that he had made the changes at Obeid &apos;s request , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for a reorganization of the government &apos;s land regime .
a telephone address presented to ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority .
said Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi .
&quot; no , &quot; Tripodi replied .
I cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .
definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .
Israeli fighter planes attack Syria , according to official sources
Israeli fighter aircraft would have attacked a destination in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night , confirmed by a senior government official against Fox News .
the official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .
according to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA 125 rockets .
at least twice this year , Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria .
foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to &quot; real estate test &quot;
the government is considering an extended &quot; real estate test &quot; for foreign workers with 457 visas .
if the test were introduced , it would be applied through a criterion designed to prevent 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or back door to move family and friends to Australia .
today , a government discussion proposal was published after former members of the Labor Party , Maxine McKew , condemned the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers because they could be perceived as insulting by Australia &apos;s neighbors .
said Australia India Institute today .
historically , this meant that white workers should be protected - and if some people in the region look at this historic artefact , I would not be surprised .
the discussion proposal outlines twelve measures previously envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .
immigration Minister Brendan O &apos;Connor , who visited Sri Lanka yesterday to discuss trafficking in human beings , has implemented five of the recommended changes , while others are still being considered .
if the &quot; authenticity criterion &quot; is adopted , then someone who applies for a visa could be checked to see whether &quot; the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the owner or relevant person of the supporting company . &quot;
firms could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after , in the past , companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally stopped hundreds .
meanwhile , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died at a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island .
the wounded nine @-@ year @-@ old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been supervised by an adult cousin since the death of his father on Wednesday , who was also on board .
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died .
a study has been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the Hs2 railway project for Scotland .
in the work of hs2 Ltd it is proposed to achieve high @-@ speed connections between Scotland and the North of England from the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 .
transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project &quot; will bring Britain closer together . &quot;
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high @-@ speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .
after completing Phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .
in June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high @-@ speed road between London and Nordengland from £ 32.7 billion to £ 42.6 billion .
the UK Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has mandated hs2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .
Baroness Kramer said : &quot; our goal for hs2 is a truly national network bringing Britain and its cities closer together . &quot;
we are moving forward with hs2 because it brings enormous benefits .
without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which will be improved thanks to hs2 .
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael said : &quot; today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland . &quot;
on behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown called on Carmichael to commit himself &quot; unambiguously &quot; to Scottish involvement in the hs2 network .
Brown said : &quot; the high @-@ speed rail link has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time Scotland &apos;s economic power also provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK . &quot;
we are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high @-@ speed rail link in Scotland , which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow @-@ Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning .
I look forward to examining the inquiry report with the British ministers next year and to jointly decide on the next steps .
rules on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers must continue to shut off tablets and smartphones when they start and land , despite efforts in the US to ease the rules on such devices .
the US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their standards so that passengers can read , watch or play e @-@ books on their devices during critical flight phases , if they are in &quot; flight mode . &quot;
during most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e @-@ books when starting and landing .
Australian companies are following the decision to implement which the US airlines will have to do a huge amount of work , but are not pursuing immediate plans to amend their rules .
CASA also stated that the announcement would be considered , but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia remained in force .
&quot; CASA does not currently have specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in aircraft , &quot; has been announced .
the issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew .
Virgin has already held talks with CASA on the extension of its Wi @-@ Fi entertainment system on flights and has stated that it is open to change , but these must be initiated by the legislator .
&quot; we would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after offering ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , &quot; said a speaker .
Qantas explained that the current rules will continue until further notice .
&quot; our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices should not be used when starting and landing , and we currently have no plans to change this , &quot; said the company .
the FAA rules apply to US airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit , and I am sure that the FAA decision and the reasons behind it will be looked closely at .
the decision varies according to the age of the fleet .
they must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio disturbances from mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand luggage programmes and customer support .
&quot; after an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , light electronic devices such as tablets , e @-@ book readers and smartphones at all levels , &quot; FAA announced .
in rare cases where there is a bad view , the crew will instruct passengers to switch off the equipment during landing .
the group also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seat or above the seat when landing .
prior to the Revierderby against Schalke , well @-@ travelled BVB trailers with light trailers had caused ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .
Borussia Dortmund announced severe consequences .
the Ultras reacted with a silence before the soccer Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart .
it was an unfamiliar , almost secular acoustics that offered the viewer until just before the Anpfiff of the Bundesligaspiels between the German Vice President Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park .
most of the guests were listening to their songs .
the southern tribe , on the other hand , where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand , initially presented themselves exceptionally quietly : no songs , no raid calls .
the podium of the Capo , which otherwise coordinates joint combustion , remained unoccupied .
and right at the front of the gallery there was one big flag with the title &quot; Section Stadionban . &quot;
only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller , as always the first BVB player to occupy the place , burned up short @-@ term jubilation .
when his team colleagues followed , there were vocal voices and daring shots - but not everywhere .
there was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern ribbon .
also , the fact that StadionSpeaker Norbert Dickel once again quoted the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbysieg , victory over Arsenal , contract extension by Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not result in a celebration .
only five minutes before the anpfiff , the Capo &apos;s podium was erected - and until then the tension , which can be seen with hands , was revealed in a loud cry when , as usual , the mood on the ranks of the stadium was questioned .
as always , the southern tribe was the last one - and at last here was the loudest place in the stadium as usual .
and at the latest , when Anpfiff from the southern ribbon came up with the loud call &quot; Derbysieger stands up , &quot; everything was again as usual .
silence was probably a reaction to what has happened in recent days .
just before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04 , some of the well @-@ travelled BVB followers had fired Leuchtraketen into the spectators &apos; cranes and onto the square - almost met Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller .
the game was delayed due to chaotic scenes .
BvB @-@ Boss Hans @-@ Joachim Watzke then received the tips of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke &apos;s words , this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fans .
&quot; there will be massive cuts for the entire ultramotion , &quot; the BVB @-@ Boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .
as an immediate measure , Watzke banned Ultras from choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart .
he said .
we cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnic .
in addition , Ultras have shown various ways to punish them - until Tuesday , they now have time to choose one .
otherwise , according to Watzke , the BVB will establish a sanction by the end of next week .
&quot; this will be significant , &quot; secured armor .
it is interesting to see what the reactions will be in the southern gallery .
deposit houses booming in Singapore as the middle class crisis has arrived
in a deposit house in the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga will exchange a golden wristband , ring and pair of earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters .
&quot; my husband and I have just bought a house , there &apos;s my money there , &quot; says Amirthalinga .
although she earned $ 3,000 a month in Singapore ( about € 1,730 ) as an administrator and her husband also works , the monthly family income is not enough , she explains .
indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where household indebtedness is increasing - is so large that ValueMax , where she has made her exchange , became the third Pfandhouse listed on the singapurish stock exchange this week .
smuggling is not only a quick way to get money - $ 1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga - but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan .
typically , Pfandhäuser in Singapore require an effective annual rate of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .
however , Pfandhäuser offer the advantage that no verification of creditworthiness or evidence of income is required , which is why loans can be made faster than banks .
this is why millions of people in the region are turning to deposit houses after families feel the pressure from rising living costs and growing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans , owing to loose fiscal policies in developed economies , families with lower and middle incomes are seeking deposit houses to compensate for the difference in sluggish economies .
this week , the rating agency called Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s growing household debt , mainly through rising mortgages , a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks .
Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore , according to the agency , have the highest budgetary debt in Asia relative to GDP .
Malaysia is at the top of the list at 80 % of GDP , an increase of 60 % in 2008 .
economists are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand , which emerged just this week from a technical recession .
on Thursday , the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand .
&quot; in the end , this means that , with rising costs , people in the middle to bottom ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible , &quot; says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .
historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have exacerbated the trend to pledge personal items , as people take the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash .
in Singapore , about 70 % of the dispossessed items are gold in the 200 deposit houses of the city state .
people say : &quot; the gold price looks good , let us feed grandmother &apos;s gold chain and get back next month . &quot;
easymoney , the largest Thai depositor , has experienced a 20 % increase in customers in its branches in recent months .
growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax , the operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia - where the company operates four houses - but also outside Asia , said Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .
the company finances this with 60 % of the 66 million Singapore dollars it entered this week with the Singapore stock exchange .
while some lenders have gone into the crossfire because of high interest rates , Yeah explains that Pfandbriefe are not only cheaper than other lenders , but also directly increased debt .
&quot; customers are insulting items they already own , and the perverse personal valuables do not increase household debt , &quot; she explains .
the bond business is increasingly accepted socially as short @-@ term , secure financing .
nor are not all people who use Pfandbrief loans in financial difficulties .
rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to feed gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 % of the purchase price in cash .
our customers come from every social class .
&quot; these include wealthy people who borrow in the short term for a business or investment , or small companies that need to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow , &quot; Yeah says .
sometimes they just need money very quickly .
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
the Secret Service Enthüller Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany clarify the increasingly explosive NSA spähaffaires .
following the presentation of Hans @-@ Christian Ströbele , a German public prosecutor or a committee of inquiry , his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex @-@ secret service worker would issue a German public prosecutor .
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation , said Flubele to the ARD magazine &quot; Panorama . &quot;
$ 325 million rescue package for Tasmanic Health
the Australian government insists on the hard conditions associated with the $ 325 million rescue package for Taoiseach health care to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money .
Federal Minister for Health , Tanya Plibersek , has announced that the Commonwealth will take &quot; immediate action &quot; to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions .
the funding for a four @-@ year period was decided following government consultations with the independent Tajik MEP Andrew Wilkie .
&quot; the government has put together an emergency response package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state , &quot; said Plibersek today .
the $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million in emergency support for electoral services .
further 2600 operations , including orthopaedic surgery and gray star treatments , aim to eliminate residues .
in addition , there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better post @-@ hospital care , specialist medicine education , mental health services , and the introduction of a system for electronic record of health data in local hospitals .
said Tanya Plibersek .
the Minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Taoiseach Government .
the state had to maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent .
a three @-@ member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use unless &quot; they are accompanied by real reforms that bring the public tasmanic health system on a more sustainable path . &quot;
despite this , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .
said Wilkie .
according to the federal government , these electoral benefits will largely offset the recent cuts .
but the opposition &apos;s health spokesman at federal level , Peter Dutton , believes that today &apos;s announcement is only a &quot; plaster solution . &quot;
&quot; we are in a position today because the Labor State Government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , &quot; he said to ABC TV .
it is not acceptable that a state government should withdraw almost half a billion dollars from the system and put 300 million in the Commonwealth and then pretend that this is good news .
Dutton called for Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .
Guillaume Nicloux &apos; adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details , but it is also more difficult to cook than necessary .
the plot in France of the 1760s tells the story of Suzanne , a young nobleman sent to the monastery by her family .
when she rebel , she faces the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic upper and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another .
the film never slips into a lustre or a sense of sensation - and that is where its problem lies .
the solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it a torment for the public .
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons , according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical and gas munitions manufacturing facilities , the global chemical weapons monitoring group declared on Thursday , while serious clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored .
also on Thursday , a Syrian group of activists announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed almost three years ago since the civil war began .
the announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) was made one day before the date on
November 1 , which Damascus , based in The Hague , had set up to destroy or &quot; inoperable &quot; all facilities for chemical weapons production , including all machinery for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition .
completing this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syrian chemical weapons by mid @-@ 2014 .
the destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
but Damascus still has to begin to destroy existing weapons and supplies .
according to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including Senfgas and the Sarin nerve gas .
the announcement came at a time when fighting took place in Safira on Thursday , when experts said that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , as the UK @-@ based Syrian Human Rights Observatory reported .
the active group , which is following the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria , declared on Thursday that 120.296 people died .
of these , 61,067 were civilians , including 6,365 children .
on the government side , 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad &apos;s army that 18,678 are pro @-@ government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .
also among the dead were 2,202 army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .
on 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011 .
this figure has not yet been updated .
the conflict has forced around two million people to flee the country .
Assad &apos;s troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels , many of whom have links to al @-@ Qaeda groups .
the observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not mention details .
the fighting underscores the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a dead civil war .
according to the OPCW , which is working closely with the United Nations , the team is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria . &quot;
therefore , &quot; no further inspection activities are currently planned . &quot;
earlier this week , the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of 23 sites indicated by Damascus .
the inspectors said that it was not possible to visit two facilities because of security concerns .
on Thursday , OPWC declared that the two sites had been abandoned according to the Syrian statement &quot; and that the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme had been transferred to other such facilities that had been inspected . &quot;
it was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that OPCW inspectors could not visit .
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will have to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month .
said Ahmed Uzumcu , Director General of the Monitoring Organization in a commentary published by OPCW .
for three years now , mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting Assad &apos;s government and security forces , many of whom belong to the Alawites , to divide Shia Islam .
in view of further developments , the head of the observation group , Rami Abdurrahman , said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .
he explained .
anger at Bali Bombs
survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the 2002 Bali bombings were angry at the verdict for the last of the instigators who were brought to justice because they believe that Umar Patek should be shot up by the law .
Patek , who was fleeing for almost ten years as one of the most sought @-@ after people of South East Asia , was sentenced yesterday to 20 years &apos; imprisonment for his role in building explosive devices for the bombing .
he could be released after 15 years of imprisonment .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .
in addition , a series of terrorist @-@ related indictments took place , including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 .
the public prosecutor had demanded a life sentence , even if she could have applied for the death penalty for the man who , because of his reputation as a master bomber , is also called &quot; Demolition Man . &quot;
the decision aroused painful memories at June Corteen , a mother of Perth , who lost her 39 @-@ year @-@ old twin @-@ storey Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his fellow conspirators almost ten years ago .
fighting with tears , she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .
&quot; you should put him in front of a shooting command , &quot; said Corteen to AAP .
I have to live with it every day that I will not get any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters anymore .
the Sari Club was equated to the ground when , on 12 October 2002 , a huge bomb exploded in a minivan parked in front of the night club .
Peter Hughes was in Paddy &apos;s Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier , a suicide bomber had an explosive backpack exploded .
he fell into the coma for one month after the attack and &quot; died &quot; three times while hanging on a life @-@ keeping system .
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah - Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago .
in fact , this type should be subject to the death penalty before everyone else .
leaving him alive - no , there is no reason to leave him alive .
getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much .
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice .
he withdrew almost a decade of arrest , but was eventually taken up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad , where US forces killed former al @-@ Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden barely four months later .
during the negotiations , a FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al @-@ Qaeda .
said Corteen .
until recently , he has shown no respect for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .
the verdict took place before the tenth anniversary of this year &apos;s attack , which is celebrated with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia .
&quot; there will be many tears this year , &quot; said Corteen .
Patek may appeal against his judgment .
FAA : passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but not make mobile phone calls )
passengers can now listen to their electronic devices from departure to landing for reading , working , playing , music and using the image of films , but not phone calls , according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the United States on Thursday .
but passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .
the speed with which they will be implemented depends on the airline , said FAA staff Michael Huerta at a press conference .
the airlines will have to prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the airline staff and the regulations governing the sale of equipment in accordance with the new rules .
FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .
among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue .
&quot; depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; the FAA announced in a statement .
currently , passengers need to switch off smartphones , tablets and other devices when closing aircraft doors .
you may not start it again until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .
when entering the landing plane , passengers must turn them off again and not start them again before the plane has landed .
under the new Directives , airlines whose aircraft are protected from electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even when they start , land and roll @-@ over , said FAA .
most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded to larger levels for the use of Wi @-@ Fi should meet the criteria .
Laura Glading , president of professional cabin crew , welcomed the changes .
&quot; if the new regulation is implemented safely - and we are working closely with the airline in this regard - both sides will benefit from it , &quot; commented Glading .
to be honest , we are sorry to have to feel like speeding up this issue .
however , Internet connections for surfing , exchanging e @-@ mails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , explained the Authority .
passengers are asked to put smart phones , tablets and other devices into flight mode .
so still no &quot; Words With Friends , &quot; the Scrabble @-@ like online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave an American Airlines jet publicly because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the fly .
and heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be dust , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .
mobile phone calls during the flight will continue to be banned .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not the FAA .
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic devices when they are launched and landed
last month Mark Rosenker said of the National Transportation Safety Board , safety expert on national transport issues on CBS News , mobile phones are still considered a risk .
&quot; mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could cause potential disturbances to navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also disturb transmitters , &quot; says Rosenker .
an industry advisory committee , set up by the FAA to examine this issue , recommended last month that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic devices .
in recent years , pressure on FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use .
critics such as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri believe that there are no valid safeguards for the ban .
restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of equipment has become ubiquitous .
some studies say that up to one third of passengers are forgetting or ignoring the switch @-@ off of the device .
the FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air passengers , after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication equipment had become known by UKW radios , which were the latest technology trend .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electric systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by FAA that do not make them electronic interferences .
airlines have been offering Wi @-@ Fi services to passengers for several years , when the altitude is reached .
air carriers adapted to Wi @-@ Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , said Huerta .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally provide much less radio broadcasting than previous generations .
e @-@ readers , for example , only give up minimal radiation if you look at it .
however , when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .
Amazon.com.
in 2011 , the company staff invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E @-@ Reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but were unable to detect them .
members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment .
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the interference with the equipment was real , even if the risk was minimal .
other committee emitters said that there are only isolated reports from pilots who are in favour of disrupting aircraft systems by the equipment , and most of them are very old .
however , the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange for passengers to switch off the equipment when they arrive under poor visibility .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would now be equipped with technology .
&quot; we are pleased that FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety , &quot; said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .
freed up by air service from North Sea drilling island of frozen birds
a bird flown to the coast by air service , exhausted on a North Sea drilling island , was released again .
the waterfall was flown to Aberdeen last month with a helicopter , where it was loaded by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa .
Colin Seddon , Head of the Centre , said : &quot; this waterfall was probably a winterly migratory bird from Northern Europe , held up by the strong winds above the North Sea . &quot;
apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island .
he added : &quot; he could no longer fly , so we were contacted with the request for help . &quot;
in her release , the water rally was fit and healthy .
is Europe &apos;s elite prepared to do business with Britain ?
business for Britain was launched in April with the aim of bringing the economy to the table and defining what those in Britain want to change our relations with the EU .
to this end , we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 executives from the economy , who depict roughly the British companies , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe , focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing , while the EU states are stagnating .
they want new trade links with countries like China , India , and Brazil to be favoured by government , rather than by the long and demanding process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .
asked for their view on certain legally regulated issues - from antitrust to product legislation - the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster .
there was general dissatisfaction about the internal market , as companies have said that the costs of Brussels legislation would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe &apos;s trading zone - even 40 % of large companies agreed with what is traditionally the most pro @-@ European .
finally , and this presumably says most , our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course of change to the agreement and not a relationship with the EU based on trade .
this insight , which is found among companies of all sizes and leading groups , shows that the economy is pushing for a &quot; meaningful change &quot; that brings the book of action back to Britain .
there is much at stake - a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum .
the Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for renegotiating British conditions for EU membership .
it also shows that companies expect a new negotiation to see a significant shift in power relations back to Britain .
a better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary now that the eurozone is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in Britain , as the result of our survey shows , which means greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
the start of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest European energy projects , explained the Gazprom Board .
&quot; today &apos;s event is a milestone : construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , &quot; said Gazprom &apos;s CEO , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .
South Stream is intended to increase diversity in Russia &apos;s export routes through Europe .
a contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , in which most of Russia &apos;s gas is stored for Europe , ensures an increased risk on conventional routes , as can be heard officially .
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were &quot; forever . &quot;
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at favourable rates when the whole project starts operating in 2015 .
according to Gazprom , construction works in other downstream countries should begin on the planned route towards the end of the year .
the pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .

hearing before the Royal Commission : two YMCA staff indicted Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
two YMCA staff from New South Wales ( NSW ) had been indicted for sexual crimes related to children before charges were made in 2011 against the child care provider Jonathan Lord of Caringbah , as the Royal Commission for the Sexual Abuse of Children .
but when the Commission made its opening statement , the YMCA stated that &quot; the organization had never had to deal with an incident of child sexual abuse . &quot;
managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which an YMCA employee had been charged for offences involving child pornography , and another where a sports teacher from YMCA Caringbah Hall was sentenced for abuse of his trusted children in 1991 .
Hare said Gail Furness , a lawyer who assisted the Commission , that he knew about the first case , but did not know the second .
he acknowledged that the YMCA &apos;s opening statement to the Commission had also been inaccurate in asserting that &quot; there have been external reviews of the YMCA , in which the YMCA was recognised as being at the forefront of child safety . &quot;
evidence before the Commission shows that YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year .
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , admitted that the management failed &quot; from me to downwards &quot; in the recruitment of Lord and did not ensure that employees knew their obligations to report violations of the child safety directives .
Lord was sentenced to twelve boys during his two @-@ year work for the YMCA earlier this year for sexual crimes .
he was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
however , Hare disagreed that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lords &quot; violations of children &apos;s safety .
the staff said that they had observed violations , including that Lord was alone with children , that they looked after them privately as babysitter , that they had them sitting on his shoes , said that he would like to do so and that children could play with his mobile phone .
Danielle Ockwell , whose leader was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the child @-@ care manager Jacqui Barnat , who was the leader of YMCA Caringbah , was &quot; very intimidating and very close to most of the time . &quot;
the managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superiors .
instead , he said , their friendship with Lord has impaired their judgment , so they would not have reported it .
Hare explained that he informed the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson the organization had to learn from the Jonathan Lord incident &quot; did not &quot; care about reporting &quot; by employees , and the Board of Directors agreed to it .
Hare said that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations occurred was taken by the director of the YMCA Children &apos;s Services , Liam Whitley .
he said that this was intended to prevent the contamination of the evidence , but that was &quot; overzealous &quot; and poorly implemented .
the YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011 , said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , expert in child sexual abuse .
he explained that there had been &quot; serious problems &quot; in recruitment , verification , preparation , training and supervision of staff .
the hearing was postponed until 20 December .
Tony Blair said that he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister - but admits that a comeback is unlikely .
in an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , the 59 @-@ year @-@ old announced his views on various domestic issues .
since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided expressing his views on British politics , and his comments have mostly been confined to foreign policy and his role as the Quartet &apos;s envoy to the Middle East .
on the question of whether he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister , Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London as saying : &quot; yes , sure , but it is unlikely that this will happen , &quot; ...
when the horse @-@ hunt experts arrived in Shanghai to shorten the horse of the year , they knew that there was a tough competition ahead .
but no one was prepared for the three @-@ year @-@ old Fenton Kirkland .
the knee , which is not even in the kindergarten and only took its first steps a few months ago , and his Shetland @-@ Pony Toffee trapped loosely through the three rounds and took the first prize - leaving 30 adult opponents behind .
the inseparable couple , both large , were praised for their presence , behaviour and style in the annual competition organised by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .
in his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had set up his leather hat in a joyful angle and led the two @-@ year @-@ old Toffee through the ring .
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony , which were well above his age .
and Toffee received best marks for his appearance and personality .
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March , and since then has been practicing the Shetland Pony every day .
his mother , Donna , 30 , said , &quot; Fenton and Toffee are a great gesture . &quot;
they had to stand up against the entire field of participation and went out of place with Goldpokal and Rosette .
it was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .
completely strangers in the arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .
the little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells , who has been showing horses for more than ten years .
Howells told : &quot; the whole audience was electrified and everyone fired and cloned him . &quot;
he ran on sand all the length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he did fantastic work .
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of .
as he started , it will not take long for him to be on the &quot; horse of the year &quot; show - and I am sure he will cut off well .
a spokesman for the annual horse show said , &quot; Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . &quot;
together they are a great team .
the jury judged Fenton and Toffee on how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the performance ring .
they care for good cooperation between Pony and Guide - and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring .
I am sure that Fenton &apos;s sweet clothes have played their part in making it really perfect .
Chinese newspaper to be &quot; reformed &quot; after call
a Chinese newspaper on the front page called for the release of a reporter charged with defamation to be reformed , said a press officer .
the New Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou .
but Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a partial state company .
the regulator said .
the &quot; Retification Order &quot; was issued by the Office for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .
preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013 , the New Express , part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group , published several inaccurate reports on the publicly listed company Zoomlion .
&quot; the editorial management of the New Express was unorganized , &quot; the regulator announced in a statement .
she said that she had decided to &quot; impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw her reporting licence . &quot;
in addition , &quot; the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to undertake a full recapitalisation of the New Express and to identify the relevant persons at the New Express and to immediately verify the New Express leadership team . &quot;
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion .
after being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work .
but then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment .
&quot; in this case , I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , &quot; he said to the state news channel CCTV .
I did it primarily because I was out of money and glory .
it has become clear to me that I have acted incorrectly .
following Chen &apos;s apology , the Neue Express published an apology on the front page , saying that it failed to check the reports correctly .
several well @-@ known suspects have recently made concessions on television .
experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced , despite a legislative amendment at the beginning of the year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves .
Drogentunnel discovered by its own railways between the US and Mexico
one of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was fully equipped with lighting , ventilation and electrical railway operations , has now been discovered .
the US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres as one of the most sophisticated passages they would have ever found .
the tunnel , which runs over a length of almost six football fields , connects Lagerhallen near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .
in the area there are countless unseeming warehouses , making it easier to hide drug @-@ contaminated lorries .
the tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported undetected .
when the tunnel was discovered , eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine had been secured , according to the Court &apos;s records .
three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were indicted for the ownership and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine .
they are threatened with prison sentences of between ten years and life .
in Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dewater channels .
the tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .
some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , putting the drug cartels at the challenge of bringing their product to consumers quickly .
in 2010 , authorities found a passage of about 640 metres with rails , which ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego .
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love
actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .
in an interview , however , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other .
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two @-@ year @-@ old Flynn .
actor Orlando Bloom spoke about the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .
in an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , &quot; Life is sometimes not exactly as we plan or hope . &quot;
Kerr and himself still loved , stressed the 36 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; we will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn . &quot;
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 their sister Flynn was born .
according to Lexika , veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism , but it is very different from it .
because while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream , ice or a strong ice @-@ cream , they are not on the menu of a vegan .
milk , cheese , egg , in addition to abandoning meat and fish , leaves the vegan out of all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied .
what remains , one might wonder , but , with a closer look , the vegan food world is characterized by a remarkable ingenuity .
&quot; breads are very popular , &quot; explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local Reform House , who provides a variety of special products for vegans .
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store in Domgasse .
for 13 years now , the native New Zealand vegan lives , in Lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . &quot; in 1997 I changed my diet and became vegetarian . &quot;
at the turn of the century , the next step was taken and I became vegan .
&quot; however , the conviction came not only because of the diet , but also because of the shoe choice , &quot; says Proctor , who prefers normal leather .
he recognized that other everyday matters are not covered by animal products .
above all , vegan is an ethics .
&quot; I do not want animals to die for me , &quot; Proctor explains the maximum amount of vegans spread across all consumer behaviour .
instead of sacrificing burgers , burners or rubber bears , the vegan quickly discovered completely new products , which increased enthusiasm .
&quot; it &apos;s a double bonus , &quot; Proctor says today , &quot; in fact vegan is not a renunciation , not an amaze , but an enrichment .
and it is precisely these conditionality that left some even so well @-@ intentioned .
&quot; the addictive factor is a crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly , similar to smoking , &quot; Proctor makes a comparison .
&quot; certain tastes are not to be found on the animal . &quot;
it is often the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .
&quot; you can create the same effect in other ways , &quot; the vegan explains .
for example , Proctor brings aubergines , champignons and a few vegans to a barbecue party .
it pays attention to a balanced , varied diet , where it should taste defective .
of course we want something between teeth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but that is not just to reduce animal food , &quot; Proctor said .
he did not suffer from health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption .
for me , the changeover had a positive aspect .
I do not take a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content .
there are high @-@ performance athletes who only feed vegan .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , I often let me check , &quot; explains Proctor .
especially the lack of vitamin B12 warn many vegansimus critics .
&quot; since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on the pasture , it is questionable whether in the meat that is bought in the coolant the vitamin B12 is high , &quot; Proctor finds .
vegans also have the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .
&quot; my B12 values are fine , &quot; he explains .
there was no need for Proctor to go far for food procurement .
basic foods are available everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .
I find everything I need on the spot .
I only buy something special from time to time .
&quot; many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive , but that is what we know is the case with &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products . &quot;
in any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time @-@ consuming than is commonly assumed .
&quot; in the kitchen there is much to discover , with a few small knees you can achieve good , if not better , results , &quot; says Proctor .
Margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cake Proctor could also bring his butterflies to the nest .
family celebrations give the vegan a new treat .
this has a new meaning when cooking together .
&quot; the situations that may arise are as different as the people themselves , &quot; Proctor says .
of course , he has already been sceptical .
do you not taste my food anymore ?
&quot; should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? &quot; - for such questions , one has to act as a vegan with fingertips .
&quot; I am not opposed to people , I am part of this society , &quot; Proctor does not want any deadline for enclaving .
and , more precisely , everyday life does not seem as vegan @-@ like as it is believed - and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed .
fast food is also allowed .
Pommes are everywhere !
&quot; many dinosaurs offer Falafel , or even a vegetarian Yufka , &quot; Proctor says .
in a pizzeria he leaves on pasta , or orders a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .
the restaurants are so slow to adjust .
&quot; when I started eating vegan 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult , &quot; the New Zealand can find a development : &quot; you have to talk to people , make them aware . &quot;
&quot; if there are enough questions , they may be inclined to add to the menu , &quot; he hopes .
vegane restaurants are developing , such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfreie .
Proctor hopes that other restaurants will have at least a vegan dish on the menu .
basically vegan dishes are available for everyone .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , &quot; Proctor states .
&quot; if we want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the vast majority impossible from the outset , &quot; Proctor says .
the purchase of vegan products could be rather difficult at the beginning .
especially when one learns to understand that animal additives can be included in peanuts as a color donor , adherence to ethics at so many hurdles and traps seems to quickly leave the courage .
not only for this reason , Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book : &quot; veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that are added to food and cleaning agents .
&quot; gradually you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to pay attention to , &quot; Proctor says .
veganism , it is an important moral finger pointing to awareness .
perhaps he does not quite manage to interpret his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to question their habits critically .
the stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to keep its customers in breath .
trading at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time .
in a communication , the operator was responsible for technical problems .
the other eleven US options markets , including two of Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .
the recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger panels with the stock exchange operator .
only on Tuesday , the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour because of errors in data transport .
in August this year alone there were two panels .
first , the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massive faulty orders to the options markets because of technical problems .
as a result , stock exchange operators took almost a whole day to see and remove the orders .
two days later , half of the total stock trade in the US fell for several hours due to a computer panic on the Nasdaq stock exchange .
in addition , last year the stock exchange of Facebook was on display .
the Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flood of purchasing and sales orders , later established the SEC stock exchange supervisor and terminated the company at a record $ 10 million fine .
Konstanz : cyclists drive 63 @-@ year olds
according to the police , the accident occurred when a 26 @-@ year @-@ old man on Thursday evening , at 22 : 00 , with a women &apos;s bike on the left @-@ hand side of the Bahnhofplatz to the market place .
when a 63 @-@ year @-@ old man suddenly departed from a local park , the bicycle driver could not slow down in time .
in the following collision , the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall , went to the ground and moved to the head for a 15 centimetre long course .
a rescue team brought the injured to the hospital for medical treatment .
British police impose an extradition decision on Assange
the British police today handed over a extradition decision to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge and asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London .
Scotland Yard explained that 40 @-@ year @-@ old Australians had been sent a &quot; call to face &quot; calling him to appear in a police guard , and added , if he did not do so , that he would be arrested .
Assange is in danger of extradition to Sweden on account of the charges in a sex offence after its possibilities under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to extradition earlier this month .
fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the US , he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .
Scotland Yard &quot; sent a call to a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man to join a police guard at a time we chose , &quot; a spokesman said .
he continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail .
the message did not comment on the delivery of the police request .
Assange fears that he will be delivered by Sweden to the United States and charged with potential spy charges after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks revelation website .
driver who was smoked between legs with 210 km / h and hot drink received £ 1,000 fine
a driver was fined £ 1,000 for driving up to 210 km / h and a hot drink between his legs .
Andrew Howie , 35 , from Tiptree , Essex , was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintree .
after the police stopped him , they discovered the beverage cup between his legs .
Howie was guilty before the Colchester District Court without having taken the necessary care and attention .
he was given seven points and a six @-@ month driving ban .
Howie was also convicted of paying £ 90 and a £ 100 grant .
tax on foreign property owners against London &apos;s speculative bubble
the Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne , who in the 2012 budget imposed a stamp tax of 7 % on housing costs over £ 2 million and annual fees for buyers who hold housing as a company rather than as individuals .
already , revenue from stamp tax on residential property in Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea districts , which amounted to £ 708 million in 2012 @-@ 13 , revenues for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the northeast , northwest , Yorkshire and the Humber region combined .
Cook said : &quot; following the increases in stamp tax on high @-@ priced housing and the introduction of related legislation against circumvention , it is difficult to say that high @-@ quality real estate is too low , regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system . &quot;
&quot; but this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy property in London , or discourage owners from selling , &quot; he added .
first @-@ class real estate - the top five to ten per cent of the housing market after price - in the wealthy south @-@ west belt of London , stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon , has increased by a record 11.8 % last year .
central London prices grew at a rate of 5.6 % per year , but were overshadowed by an emerging &quot; domestic market , &quot; where the southwest part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , according to a survey of Savill .
scientists have been able to shed more light on the context in which the tail of a dog is related to his mood .
earlier research had shown that happy dogs with the tail were more to the right ( from the dog &apos;s point of view ) , while it was the left side for nervous dogs .
but now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trento , said : &quot; in humans it is well known that the left and right brains react differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions . &quot;
here we tried to look at this with other species .
he also noted that dogs , like humans , are responsible for the left @-@ wing movement and vice versa , and that the two hemisphere played different roles in feelings .
in order to learn more about how dogs react to the side tail needles of their pets , researchers monitored the animals while these films were watching other dogs .
they measured the heart rate of the violin and analysed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the tail moves in one direction or another .
Professor Vallortigara said : &quot; we have shown the dogs movies with dogs - either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and thus we have managed to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right . &quot;
when the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the wound dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .
if , however , the tail tendency was mainly left ( again from the point of view of the dog who wounded ) , their heart rate rose and they looked unsettled .
according to Professor Vallortigara , the dogs do not communicate intentionally through these movements .
on the contrary , he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience which movements they should be concerned about and when not .
he said : &quot; if you have different encounters with other dogs and the wedding is linked to the tail in one direction rather with friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . &quot;
researchers say that knowledge could help dog owners , veterinarians and trainers to understand the emotions of their animal .
John Bradshaw , an expert in dog behavior and host diplomat at the Faculty of Animal Health at the University of Bristol explained that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right was important for dogs .
last year a team at the University of Lincoln discovered that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog , and to the right when it is a satisfied dog .
in another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada , it was as follows : &quot; dogs go to a robot dog if they are , tail &quot; on the left and not on the right , instead of getting troubled - exactly the opposite than in the Italian study . &quot;
according to his statement , the differences could therefore prove that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robotics dogs as dogs .
a study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .
&quot; while there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes , many of the details still have to be determined - and dogs are no exception , &quot; says Bradshaw .
however , since their behaviour is simply recorded , it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .
Arctic Monkeys move appearance in Glasgow due to the illness Alex Turner
the Rockband Arctic Monkeys moved an appearance in Glasgow after their lead singer was sick of knee head inflammation .
the band from Sheffield should play in Hydro on Friday .
due to the sickness of the lead singer Alex Turner , the concert must now be moved .
the band &apos;s announcement came after it had to postpone an appearance in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .
in a statement on their official website , the Arctic Monkeys said : &quot; after the decision to cancel the show in the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening as well as medical advice , Arctic Monkeys must cancel the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday , November 1 . &quot;
&quot; Alex Turner has diagnosed a knee @-@ head inflammation , which is why he is unfortunately unable to occur . &quot;
the show in the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 , which was moved to November 21 at Hydro in Glasgow .
all tickets remain valid for these shows .
we apologize to all ticket holders for their inconvenience .

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis was appointed for the first time on 22 February by the Catholic Church , as announced by the Vatican on Thursday .
cardinals are the most senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who elect a Pope , so that Franziskus will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor .
there are currently 201 cardinals .
however , a cardinal who has reached an age of 80 can no longer take part in the ballot - that is the case of a group of 120 &quot; voting cardinal . &quot;
in a statement announcing the news , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that there would be a meeting of all Cardinals before the ceremony was held to appoint the new Cardinals , also known as the Consistorium .
&quot; Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the consistency in February so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinal channels from all over the world can be planned , &quot; Lombardi said .
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of voting cardinals would probably have fallen by February .
he explained that a Pope usually nominates as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of cardinals eligible to vote again amounted to 120 , and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants .
next year &apos;s consistency is important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year , Valero said .
at present , there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and , in particular , Italy .
he said .
forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinal channels .
the Cardinals will also be the first to be convened since the formation of the Franciscan Council , a group of eight Cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the church .
in the past , the Pope decided everything alone .
said Valero .
he said that it was &quot; well possible &quot; that Franziskus would ask the Cardinals for advice .
but so far we have not been in this situation - that is all new .
Valero said that the bishops from large places would typically be called cardinal channels , but Franziscus &quot; is full of surprises - so we do not know who he appoints . &quot;
GM calls for new pickup trucks in the US to repair seats
general Motors is calling back almost 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado- and GMC Sierra @-@ Pickup trucks with a construction year 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest , according to a notification from the US car safety regulator on Friday .
for some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for moving the front seat back .
for this reason , they do not comply with the federal guidelines on vehicle safety for head restraints .
&quot; when driving on the vehicle from the back , it is possible that the head restraints do not properly protect the occupants , so there is an increased risk of injury , &quot; was read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .
the reclaimed models were made between 1 August and 10 September .
the delivery of GM trucks started in June and is the main model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency @-@ related restructuring in 2009 .
GM informed car owners about the defect in the first half of October .
due to the 16 @-@ day government shutdown , NHTSA could not check the notification letter , which had a negative impact on car purchases in October .
the sale of the Silverado- and Sierra @-@ Trucks , newly developed for the 2014 model year , increased by 20 % in the first ten months of the year ,
in October GM sold 42,660 SilverFast and 16,503 Sierra @-@ Pickup trucks .
GM &apos;s share grew 1.4 % on the New York Stock Exchange to $ 37.47 on Friday afternoon .
an Obama Spokesman
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible
he says that Obama has made commendable efforts , which have been thwarted by Republicans &quot; blockade tactics .
blocking policy does not excuse Obamacare &apos;s website problems , drug attacks
Obama &apos;s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what could have been done .
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year .
I am currently reading a terribly sad book .
it is a book that I believed would heal me during the crazy second year of my medical studies and give me hope again .
it is called &quot; The Audacity to Win &quot; and describes Barack Obama &apos;s memoirs for the 2008 presidential election .
when I am finished with my patients &apos; records and go to bed in the evening , the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could smoke the breath .
the election became a landslide victory and news spokesmen held to reflect the historic significance of this hour .
my classmates wept with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find .
a young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .
when Obama took office in 2008 , he had 82 % approval values .
and then I close the book .
turning back to the present is a bad awakening as if you are pulled out of a dream .
it is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .
in the years since I voted for the first time , something has actually changed .
but it is simply nothing I could have imagined .
I acknowledge the great and diverse things Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of forced disappearance of homosexuality in the army , and the killing of Osama bin Laden .
I agree that party @-@ political blockade tactics have turned too much effort to move our nation forward : immigration reform , a public health @-@ insurance option , and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .
but having defended the Obama administration on countless occasions to colleagues and acquaintances , I ended up trying to explain .
I have reached a point of political despair .
Republican blockade politics cannot explain why foreign leaders are allowed to intercept , or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas .
it cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans , and why whistleblowers are punished that disclose government misconduct .
it cannot explain why Anwar al @-@ Awlaki , a US citizen , was murdered without trial , and why public funding and spending limits were circumvented during the presidential election .
it does not justify the results of a report which says that the efforts of the White House to suppress the media are the &quot; most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . &quot;
and , more recently , it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .
I do not know whether this is what I should have expected .
whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns .
obviously , the office is not a predictable course , because an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre are shaping public debate .
but if I look at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .
and that disturbs me most .
I re @-@ elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unsophisticated alternative , he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions .
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from pressure from future elections , would fulfill the hope that we had been hearing for so long .
but , with Obama &apos;s approval ratings down to less than 45 % this week , that book &apos;s return to 2008 has become all the tougher .
it awakens in me the yearning for the many promises that have broken up in the air .
this week , I read a section of the book describing how Obama had to make a serious loss against Clinton in Pennsylvania &apos;s primary election .
in a meeting with the electors after the decision , he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow their cause .
he said .
we must remember who we are .
it is five years later , Mr President , and I could not agree more with you .
the views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris .
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
the billionaire and MEP , Clive Palmer , says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest in his parental leave plans because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it .
the mining magnate , in a legal dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in CO2 taxes , claimed that he wanted to throw questions off the table as to whether he was in conflict .
the Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important in deciding whether to remove or reduce CO2 and mining taxes .
but Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott &apos;s daughters would personally benefit from the laws .
&quot; he is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not to leave , &quot; Palmer said .
two months after the election , the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared the winner of Fairfax &apos;s Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes .
Palmer called for a review of the voting counting process so that it could proceed more quickly .
Tony Abbotts daughters Frances and Bridget .
should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote ?
&quot; we need a better system , &quot; he said .
why should we not have a system whereby you invade , enter the data into a computer immediately and then get the result at 6.30 p.m.
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers .
do you use them because you can wipe out the results if you don &apos;t like them ?
it is incredible to vote with pencils today .
the Electoral Commission examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .
Palmer , 59 , said that his policy was an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new post &quot; very seriously . &quot;
a public office is about the public service .
&quot; we are not seeking a reward other than history , namely that we can serve this community at a critical time , &quot; he said .
RBS suspends two Forex traders
the Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division , two people familiar with the situation ; this is yet another indication that the worldwide official investigation of the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly taking place .
some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they are working with the authorities to investigate the world &apos;s largest financial market , where 5.3 billionaires change ownership every day .
the two traders would be the first RBS staff to be suspended in the expanding investigation resulting from the Libyor interbank scandal .
the bank , which did not comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities .
&quot; our investigation on this issue continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators , &quot; said the Bank two weeks ago .
last month , persons close to the situation indicated that RBS forwarded the records of e @-@ mails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the UK Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .
this trader , Richard Usher , had left RBS in 2010 and is now expected to have been judged by his current position as European Head of Forex spot trading at JPMorgan .
Rohan Ramchandani , head of the European spot trading at Citi , was judged this week and Matt Gardiner , formerly the leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS , was suspended at Standard Chartered this week .
none of these traders was accused of misconduct .
Usher &apos;s Instant Message Group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup , said close people .
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator FINMA had declared that it was seeking a presumed manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .
at least six authorities worldwide - the European Commission , FINMA , the Swiss competition authority WeKo , the FCA , the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on currency market transactions .
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .
banks cross Instant Messages and emails from several years in search of cases of malpractice .
the news about these investigations has put traders in turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment banks &quot; trading units in recent years , but has been under pressure this year because low currency volatility limits speculators &quot; chances .
some bankers have tried to downplay the affair , saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign @-@ exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .
a leading trader noted that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading , fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of banks &apos; own internal platforms lead to &quot; one can influence the market with very low ticket prices . &quot;
the news came out the same day , when Credit Suisse announced that it had cancelled a trader of its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week , after causing a loss of nearly $ 6 million at the end of last year .
the Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and worked with them .
said Credit Suisse .
painted on the Bechtle plot
a group of citizens &apos; initiative &quot; Schweizer Wiese &quot; has enriched the architectural charm on the Bechtle plot at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb .
in addition , she smoked and spread the footpath , as stated in a press release .
the planned cover of the shattered house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for safety reasons because the site is in danger of being demolished .
Alfred Abel , who currently manages the property , had agreed the beauty action with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI .
before the BI action , a banner with the message &quot; We were in favour . &quot;
however , this did little to disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens &apos; initiative .
her motto on the big poster was &quot; We are against building ruins . &quot;
in doing so , she wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - if the giant project one day fails .
in conversation with many passers in front of the &quot; building site , &quot; it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the city project would be better for many , although not many have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI .
but they start to resign because the city is delaying these responses , the BI says .
as has been said , the citizens &apos; public statements also have an impact .
at the local council meeting , the public had said that he was afraid of the end of the thermal bath if the citizens voted against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow .
some therefore seem rather frightened , others perceive them as &quot; plumps of blackmail &quot; to the population , according to the BI press release .
the BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers .
Rangnick Shadow for Schiris : don &apos;t Swalbenkönig
as satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg , the sports director of the &quot; Bullen &quot; was disappointed by the referees .
&quot; there is a dangerous tendency at the moment for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the Schwalbenköge category , &quot; he defended the two insulators at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday .
the most recent reason for Rangnick &apos;s criticism was Yellow for Mane at the 3 : 0 against Grödig last Sunday , when the Senegalese became an alleged actress - though not , as the TV pictures showed .
&quot; a stark misdecision , &quot; said Rangnick , the referee Harkam .
Harkam would also have contributed &quot; his part &quot; to the escalation between Salzburg @-@ Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig @-@ Trainer Adi Hütter after the match .
he declared his German compatriot : &quot; I would have behaved in the same way in every single situation as Roger Schmidt . &quot;
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague after the sleigh .
I do not know why .
&quot; for I am the one who was insulted , &quot; stressed the 46 @-@ year @-@ old .
in view of the success story , Rangnick agreed a lobeshymn .
&quot; for this there are only two words : right , &quot; he said .
there is not much to suspend .
the way the team plays is particularly impressive .
this should continue .
there will be little change in the winter transfer time .
there are no great reasons to change anything .
&quot; except for a player who wants to leave the club , Rangnick made clear .
Supreme Court confirms Obama &apos;s Health Law
it is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional .
with five to four votes , the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - forcing US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 - is constitutional within the framework of the state &apos;s fiscal authority .
the chief judge John Roberts took the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy decided against it .
the Court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the law and considered that the provision of the Health Act , according to which states would either have to extend the conditions of access for Medicaid or that all state aid subsidies would be removed , was not unconstitutional .
the case against the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .
the law was strongly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney , in the pre @-@ election campaign in 2012 .
Norway : Norwegian place with giant mirrors
with huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their darkest valley .
due to the low sunrise , the Rjukan , located in the Vestfjord valley , normally falls in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .
with three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 metres , a century dream was realized on Wednesday .
&quot; finally ! , &quot; warmed Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony in TV2 .
some of the people living in the valley were right to sunbeds , while others used sunglasses to be safe .
so far , sun @-@ worshippers had to go to a nearby summit with a cable car in winter .
ten years ago , the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors .
however , this basic idea has been in place since 1913 .
after several years of debate , the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns ( approximately € 615 000 ) expensive project .
a similar construction has been provided to the Italian Alpine resort of Viganella for several years .
post hardly leaks on Sundays
&quot; many citizens will not have noticed it yet , the red points for Sunday lease are still in various letter boxes in the core city and the districts , but reading the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG , you quickly find out that the lease on Sundays and Holidays no longer takes place . &quot;
a FDP request confirmed this .
on Sundays and public holidays , only in front of the post office building in Ernst @-@ Ludwig @-@ Straße 36 and Jakob @-@ Müller @-@ Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld .
whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten will also be emptied Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP request .
the Social and Youth Policy spokesman of the FDP , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to follow here .
the Sunday lease is an important postal service especially in the case of Terminpost .
&quot; despite the increase in the price of letters in January 2013 , this enterprise is radically and unreasonable . &quot;
Thomas Bittner , Liberal Group Chairman and President of the City Council , supports his group colleagues : &quot; what annoys me is the fact that here , clameless changes are being made or even deleted . &quot;
the post office is very close to the citizens .
&quot; at least the letter boxes in the districts of Neuschloss and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays , &quot; says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono .
it is also true of the core city , especially non @-@ mobile citizens , that a letter box with a Sunday lease should also be able to walk .
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post office on this matter .
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim .
however , in Hofheim there is also a Sunday lesson .
your party was in favour of privatisation .
said Maier .
Frankfurt parking charges are set to rise sharply
parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive .
this morning , the city &apos;s Magistrate is discussing a presentation by Stefan Majer ( Green ) .
this means that parking charges will be increased by 50 % .
for this purpose , however , it is not a question of increasing prices , but of shortening the time interval of parquet clocks and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes .
in December , then , the City Council will have to decide .
the Retail Committee of IHK Frankfurt considers this &quot; not a good idea . &quot;
parking directly in front of the shop was &quot; an advantage not to be underestimated for small retailers . &quot;
the German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is &quot; quite appropriate and long overdue . &quot;
public transport would also become more expensive .
city of Freudenstadt : quick actions overrun hosts
the TSV Freudenstadt gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to take part in the Schiller School Hall in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb .
the elder had an experienced team on the other side of the network .
soon , however , it became clear that they could not fully compete with the rapid actions of the Freudenstadter .
the Gönninger was extremely difficult with the hard and bursting attacks .
they repeatedly missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz neatly over the center of the network and were not present in the blockade defence .
two high first statutes clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstadt in all matters .
in the face of this stifling and game @-@ defining performance , the third sentence was then won somewhat lightly and lustlessly at the 3 : 0 end level ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
on November 2 , the TV Baiersbronn , which was clearly established in Nagold , will be a far more powerful opponent in the field .
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pälchen , Stefan Räller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .
in the B class , the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt stood in front of the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .
they delivered a hard fought two @-@ hour match .
nervousness on both sides caused errors and punctuation problems , especially in the ballooning process ; even in the case of passports , precision was sometimes scarce and in some critical game scenes the overzealous avoided looking for possible points .
in this highly balanced meeting , however , the TSV team at Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed on the great physical effort and a pleasant commitment of both teams .
care day at the small England hut
for the fifth day of care in the aftermath of the Natura 2000 project , a group of dedicated participants met at the small England hut in Ibach .
due to suggestions from the population , on this day in the area of the hut the gaze into the valley should be freed , said Mayor Helmut Kaiser .
many hikers , according to the emperor , called this area the gloss of the gorge , where the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views .
he thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the Care Day was an appropriate tool for strengthening the link between man and nature .
it offers every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself .
at the same time , ecological considerations can be taken into account with the tourist aspect .
this ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Nature Protection of the Government of Freiburg , following the welcome from the Councillor Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success .
according to Tribukait , the tourist destination of the wide view is in line with the aim of maintaining the well @-@ growing old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting with the remaining pastures .
certain species , such as rare butterflies and tombs , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .
you need these free connections for conservation .
Tribukait said that she did not want to miss out on a laugh for the planned biosphere area .
not only does the current measure integrate seamlessly into this planning .
a biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development based on the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the achievements of the life project as well as previous nursing days .
after these various presentations , Revier Leaders Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups .
the larger trees had already been beaten in advance , and the forest trawler could be ready for use .
a group of helpers should take care of the release of wax bushes and the maintenance of a drying barrier .
the aim was to have a free view at the viewpoint .
spoon : still the only candidate
information on the Internet : although the Baar town of Löffingen , with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a forward @-@ looking school , child , youth and seniors policy , as well as its own city centres , has not yet registered a second mayor candidate .
as the only candidate for the succession of the mayor Norbert Brugger , who is no longer standing for age , the 46 @-@ year @-@ old banker and manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has been established .
the application period expires on Monday 11 November at 6 p.m.
Google , Samsung , Huawei over Nortel patents
on Thursday , the group , which owns thousands of former Nortel patents , imposed an avalanche of claims for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that was outlawed by Nortel in the bankruptcy auction .
Rockstar , the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. District Court in Texas .
Rockstar is owned by Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement .
the patents relate to technology that brings search terms into line with relevant advertising on the Internet , the complaint thus affecting the core of Google &apos;s search engine business .
representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible .
Samsung , Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google &apos;s Android operating system , which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft &apos;s mobile products .
in 2011 , Google made an initial bid of $ 900 million for Nortel patents .
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .
after it was outbid by Rockstar &apos;s Nortel patents , Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $ 12.5 billion , a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola &apos;s library of patents .
&quot; although Google has failed in trying to acquire the patent at the auction , Google has violated the patents and continues to do so , &quot;
Rockstar claims that Google &apos;s patent infringement is intentional , according to the accusation .
Egypt &apos;s First freely elected President
Mohammed Morsi sets the rule , but his day of triumph should not mean an end to Egypt &apos;s political disputes .
the Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a &quot; new Egypt &quot; when he was the first freely elected president of the country to take over the succession of Husni Mubarak , who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier .
with his inauguration at the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt &apos;s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago .
he placed the oath in front of the 18 judges of the court , who had his seat on the Nile , and followed by an ancient Egyptian temple .
&quot; we are striving for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , &quot; said Mursi at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television .
&quot; today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom , genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said Morsi , a US @-@ trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that had been targeted most of the time since its creation 84 years ago as a banned organization by the government .
hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Mursi arrived shortly after 11 o &apos;clock local time in a small car convoy .
only a few hundred followers had gathered in the court to cheer the new president , and , unlike Mubarak &apos;s presidential push , traffic was only temporarily stopped so that the auto convoy could cross the usually busy street that connects the city centre to the southern suburbs .
as an uncharismatic &quot; spare wheel &quot; of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , in which he presented himself not only as a candidate for Islamists , but all those who wanted to achieve the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak .
&quot; Egypt is today a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , &quot; said Morsi , dressed in a blue suit with red collar , told judges in the wood @-@ panelled chamber in which he abandoned his office .
later Mursi went to the University of Cairo where he should give his inaugural address .
he was officially welcomed by an army captain playing the national anthem he heard in his belongings .
the military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present .
on his arrival , he was greeted by hundreds of people present in the university &apos;s largest hearing room , with speakers from &quot; The Army and the People are a hand . &quot;
built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , the University of Cairo has become a stronghold of Islamic student groups in the 1970s .
on Friday , Morsi set off a symbolic oath in Tahir Square , the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak &apos;s authoritarian rule , and he promised to reclaim presidential powers that the Military Council had assumed by the head of state who was driven out of office .
but by standing before the court and not as usual before Parliament , he is bowing to the will of the military , indicating that the power struggle will continue .
Morsi &apos;s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures .
Falkenberger Discothek ensures two great evenings .
the new season in the Falkenberger Discothek &quot; Blue Velvet &quot; has begun .
this Friday evening it is called &quot; Pump this party . &quot;
fats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days .
workers crashed by ladders : seriously injured
on Thursday , a 51 @-@ year @-@ old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and seriously injured .
the man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating senator at the outside facade of an inn .
when he climbed to the ladder , he slipped away and the man plunged onto the concrete floor .
he suffered serious injuries and was brought to Salzburg with the rescue helicopter &quot; Christophorus 6 . &quot;
rape in South Africa : two life imprisonment
nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17 @-@ year @-@ old girl in South Africa , the perpetrator was sentenced twice to life on Friday .
this was reported by SABC .
the victim died later because of the serious injuries .
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of crime .
the act had caused horror throughout the country .
the then 21 @-@ year @-@ old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town .
doctors fought for the survival of the victim for 14 hours , but in vain .
the sight of young people was so appalling that nurses and sisters needed psychological support .
Kana had admitted during the trial to be in tattoo with Booysen in a bar .
he also admitted having beaten and raped them , but he denied being responsible for the death of the girl .
the police initially assumed several perpetrators but left two suspects out of prison because the evidence against them was insufficient .
during the trial , the public prosecutor also stressed that Kana was alone at the time of the attack .
rape is almost a daily occurrence in South Africa : there are about 64 000 advertisements per year for sexual violence .
this is almost ten times as much as in Germany , but with 82 million people , it has a much higher population than South Africa ( 50 million ) .
the police and women &apos;s associations in South Africa , however , estimate the incidence of sexual violence 10 @-@ 25 times .
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the &quot; best ham in the world &quot; : for the TV show &quot; Galileo , &quot; the Pro7 Star Bonndorf visited .
the speaker makes it clear right from the start : the most important thing for the ham is the pig cows , and turbomast is not a good condition .
can ham you get in any supermarket be a quality product ?
Uli , head of the large Schinkenfabrik in the Black Forest , explains the operation of the company &quot; Adler &quot; in Bonndorf .
&quot; Germany &apos;s favourite ham , &quot; as Jumbo announces to the Black Forest ham .
only with hair protection and kite he comes inside the factory .
Jumbo also needs to disintegrate his hands before he is allowed to attack the micro .
Jumbo to strengthen Schnellimbiss in Waldshut
&quot; here , I am working for a warm amount , &quot; amazed the Fernseh @-@ Machers , Black Forest ham as a mass product .
16,000 keys a week speak for themselves .
weight , fat , color : Uli explains what quality matters .
most pigs are slaughtered at six months .
television with a level ?
details such as the Ph value of the meat also play a role .
the darker the meat , the higher the ph value .
&quot; I &apos;m excited if you Roberto Blanco measure what happens then , &quot; says Jumbo cynical .
here the level of private TV is presented in pure culture .
but watching is worthwhile .
the spectator sees that the crushing of the cone remains handmade .
because : black @-@ and @-@ white ham is traditionally not found in the shelf .
the secret of ham is the spices mix with salt .
Jumbo looks like a &quot; submarine . &quot;
the trick : tannenzweige ensures the special taste of the Black Forest ham .
20 days in smoke make the ham almost black .
&quot; now the disc disappears in the Jumbo , &quot; he announces the test delivery .
&quot; he is really delicious , &quot; says the TV star &apos;s conclusion .
this will enable all parties to live .
you thought that travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet ?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend .
the company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenue from holiday makers in Australia and the UK .
the travel company now assumes an adjusted annual profit before taxes of between $ 325 and $ 340 million , compared to $ 305 to $ 315 million in its previous forecast .
if the current target values are met , this means growth of 12 @-@ 17 % compared to the record gain of $ 290.4 million over the period 2011 @-@ 12 .
as Managing Director Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start to the second half of the year , especially in Australia and Britain .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are on track to record annual income before interest and taxes , &quot; he said .
these include Australia and the United Kingdom , which are typically among our strongest performers .
in Australia , the leisure sector has recovered in the second half of the year , making it a slightly weaker market for business trips .
it was similarly good for Flight Centre &apos;s leisure activities in the UK , while business customers were spending less .
the US business recovered from the more seasonally weaker first half of the year , so a profit is expected for the third consecutive year .
Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents yesterday to 38.20 dollars .
schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics , spelling and grammar
in future , students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare , a 19th century novel , romantic lyrics , and contemporary British novels from 1914 .
the test also includes &quot; unread texts &quot; to encourage wider reading .
the combined course of English literature and language will be abolished .
from 2015 onwards , students will have to pass an independent GCSE test for language , with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification .
tomorrow , the Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics - the first subjects that have been radically redesigned .
other core issues will be changed next year .
in a separate initiative , Ofqual , the supervisory authority for audits , will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures , including a new naming system and less course work .
in a speech this summer , Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is a &quot; broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence , &quot; stressing that the GCSes would become &quot; challenging , ambitious , and stricter . &quot;
studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools - 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year - than in most other countries .
by contrast , Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours .
while there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable , coalitions are said to encourage schools to devote more hours to comprehensive Matheprüche , combined with a greater weighting of specialist in rankings .
the curriculum focuses more on &quot; real life problems , &quot; including financial mathematics .

SALEM : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Meeting Forum
the next Ecumenical Meeting Forum on Monday 21 October , at the New Museum of the Castle , the topic &quot; On hell with hell - Theological reflections on how to deal with the last things today . &quot;
lecturer is Professor Johanna Rahner .
the Ecumenical Meeting Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelical church communities of Salem , the Castle of Salem and the Cultural Office of the Bodensee Circle .
Johanna Rahner wants to explore in the forum how people today classify the &quot; last things &quot; after death .
if people had known too much about it over the past centuries , relying on the images of heaven and hell &quot; that still characterise our ideas , &quot; the contemporary prophetic doctrine of hope for completion is characterized more by a degree of embarrassment or even a lack of language .
&quot; the greater hope has been driven out Christianity by religious critique , &quot; says the speaker .
she has &quot; supplied us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamations . &quot;
Johanna Rahner continues : &quot; but the crucial challenge remains the anger of death . &quot;
this implies the question of the yearning , &quot; who dreams that everything will be good in the end . &quot;
Johanna Rahner , born in 1962 in Baden @-@ Baden , studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert @-@ Ludwigs @-@ Universität Freiburg .
she graduated in 1997 from Dr. theol . , also in Freiburg .
the Habilitation for Fundamentaltheology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at Wilhelms University .
since 2010 , Johanna Rahner has a chair for systematical theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel .
Geislingen : more than 100 young Catholics from Kleine Heuberg confirm their belief in the company
in two services of worship 101 15 and 16 @-@ year @-@ old youths of the Seelungsunit Am Kleine Heuberg have been established .
in the morning the service accompanied the Laudato @-@ Si group , in the afternoon of The Spirit .
with the reception of the company , the young people said yes to their baptism and inherited the power of the Holy Spirit .
over the past few months , under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of many community members , the Firmlingen had prepared for the great celebration .
in different projects , they met various tasks of the Christian community and together experienced the Youth Day in Unterpoweral .
Illmensee : second mountain bike race excites participants
in beautiful weather 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to manage the round course across the hills around the lake .
Ulrich Knobel informs about this from the organizing Sportverein Illmensee .
among the participants , especially at the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , were also numerous jedermannsradler who wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere .
two junior drivers from the German top class were also at the start of this race : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach @-@ Linz made a recommendation to the German Championships .
these two could , as expected , depart from the field .
as in the previous year , Felix Bader was able to save a small leap in time to his goal and defended his title as a winner of the short distance .
in second place Pascal Treubel was able to place himself again .
for the ladies , it was Theresa Duelli of the team nightmare who managed to win the race .
in place two and three Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers came from Owingen .
a pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the municipality .
not only in terms of performance , the whole range of athletes was represented .
the age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to more than 70 years for the oldest starters .
this year , even more top athletes were at the start .
four drivers were able to depart from the regional top riders .
among them Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike semi @-@ professional from the Black Tusk Racing team .
Pangerl , together with a team colleague , has been a world champion twice in twelve @-@ hour driving .
this year he became a European champion in this special discipline .
with Roland Ballerstedt , who already called two German championship titles in the duathlon his own .
after 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , there was a whopping finale in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall .
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line .
just one second behind it , the routine Ballerstedt secured the second place in the overall rating .
at the same time Hermann and Warthmann were the third to the overall rating .
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in her career .
the second place was secured by Areane Blersch from bingen in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart .
athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organised course of the event .

you can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to elect him to the &quot; CNN Hero of the Year . &quot;
the winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years Georges Bwelve looked at how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon in 1981 .
at first , he had only one broken arm , but then a inflammation was formed that spread to his brain and caused a hematom there that was supposed to affect him for the rest of his life .
&quot; there were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , &quot; said Georges Bwelle .
we would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had had the money .
instead , Bwelve spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .
&quot; it is not easy , &quot; commented Bwelle .
you can leave the house at five o &apos;clock in the morning and drive to the hospital to be the first and not the first .
there are a great many patients .
some people even die because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since Bwelles father died in 2002 .
in Cameroon there is only one doctor for 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organisation .
on the other hand , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people .
but even if there were a doctor for her , most Cameroon could not afford to visit .
two out of five people live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of the country &apos;s health expenditures are private .
&quot; the only problem they have is poverty , &quot; says Bwelle .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
to see his father and so many of his compatriots suffering , in a wave , made the decision to do something about it .
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer have carried out 700 free operations last year .
he became a doctor himself and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .
he also founded a non @-@ profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there .
since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32,000 people .
almost every Friday he and up to 30 people forced themselves into minibuses and drive with the snow @-@ covered medical equipment on the roof over unsecured terrain to the villages that need help .
things are not always going smoothly .
more than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .
but when they arrive , they will be received as heroes : a celebration , singing and dance and the best accommodation the place has to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and wave - with its broad smile and limitless energy - at the happy celebration .
the next morning the team will start investigating hundreds of patients .
&quot; we treat 500 people per trip , &quot; says Bwelle .
they come from a distance of 60 kilometres around the village - and that is on foot .
each of these weekend clinics provides medical care in a number of areas .
many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
others get clutches , donated glasses , or free birth certificates - a document that is necessary for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team carries out simple operations with local anaesthesia .
the operations usually take place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the intervention , the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next .
the lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and thus work waves and its volunteers until the early hours of the morning on Sunday .
it is a demanding pensum , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .
&quot; you drill all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work , &quot; says Bwelle .
on Sunday the team will return to the city , tired but proud of the work done .
the group - a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students - carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference for the people they help .
a man explained that the free operation of a corpse that he received now allows him to work again .
&quot; this changes the future of my family , &quot; the man said .
in addition to weekend clinics and his work as surgeon in the hospital , Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night .
with this second job he finances 60 % of his non @-@ profit activity , Bwelle ; the rest comes from private donations .
&quot; I really do not know when he sleeps , &quot; says Katie O &apos;Malley , who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteer in Bwelles Group .
he is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .
for medical and health @-@ care students such as O &apos;Malley , who come from the US and Europe to support waves , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never have at home .
&quot; we can be involved in operations where we help remove blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle , &quot; explains O &apos;Malley .
this would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .
students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon and often bring donated sanitation material .
but once they are in Yaoundé , Bwelle takes over accommodation , transport and instruction .
&quot; he is undoubtedly a hero , &quot; says O &apos;Malley .
he dedicates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no limits .
almost permanent work is not a burden on bystanders .
giving others a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he made to his father gives him great pleasure .
&quot; I am so happy when I do this work , &quot; says Bwelle .
and I am thinking of my father .
I hope he sees what I do .
I do it to bring people to laugh again and to relieve the pain .

an excellent fight
the role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingways Novelle &quot; The old man and the sea , &quot; Horst Janson is cut onto the body .
Janson is himself an old hase in his metier , the acting art .
the old man Santiago cannot pretend anything about fishing .
so the two simply complement each other great .
people almost think that they can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man of whom the fishing boy Manolo speaks .
when Santiago is tired of life sitting on the chair , Janson really does .
in addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excellently mastered .
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and his will .
Janson is on stage on a wide range of tracks .
he manages to focus the attention of the public , so that his monologues are not boring for a moment .
his efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made up of blue illuminated water bottles .
director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man operate in the boat in front of the fishing village .
in the course of the performance he illuminates the active scene : the Santiago hut , the bar of the singer Marie @-@ Luise Gunst , who , with her songs and her wonderful voice , captures Cuba &apos;s sense of life .
the four musicians play Cuba &apos;s rhythm and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : descent to the Romans
a sewage channel from the Roman era is preserved below Cologne at about 120 metres .
if you visit Cologne , don &apos;t miss the cathedral .
the two towers rise into the sky about 157 metres , making it the second @-@ highest church building in Europe .
but only a few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers understand that there is also a lot to discover under the Duomo .
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne .
meeting point for his tours is the service center of Cologne @-@ Tourism directly at the Duomo .
the tour starts unspectacularly : &quot; we start in the underground garage , &quot; says Schulze .
in the seventies , the city &apos;s founders wanted an autochthonous city , and therefore the remains of the old city wall only stood what was not too big .
for this reason , most users of the car park are now also passing the Roman remnants and only leaving their car .
but if you look more closely , the D2 Parkdeck will discover an archaeological site separated by metal grids .
there are about five meters high ruins of handcrafted stones .
&quot; it is the remains of the Roman city wall built after Christ in the second half of the first century , &quot; says Schulze .
before it goes back to the daylight , the students at the upper parking level take a look into a dark , 15 @-@ metre deep shaft .
this is the well of the old dome , which is unfortunately hardly seen .
the next stop of the tour is the Pretorium , and here the participants descend back to the depth .
here we see the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the head of the CCAA .
what CCAA means is what a visitor wants to know .
&quot; the abbreviation stands for &quot; Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium , &quot; which in well German means &quot; City of Roman Law and City of Agrippinenser , founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the Empress Choir . &quot;
and the Pretorium is the former palace of statutes , the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .
from the hall of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman sewage channel , which is preserved here at about 120 metres .
&quot; you can walk a piece along the so @-@ called Cloaca Maxima if you want , &quot; says Schulze .
there is still one surprise .
after picking up the key at the checkout , he will lead the group to a 16 @-@ metre @-@ deep , accessible shaft .
&quot; we are now in the Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the Jewish community built their bathroom deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing .
to this day , in the lower end of the Mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels can be read through changing levels of the Rhine .
the Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square for which the construction work will begin shortly .
however , a number of years will elapse until completion .
leg almost hacked : recirculation of rocker process
a bloody attack in the rockermilieu will be reopened after more than four years .
a trial of attempted death , dangerous physical injury and damage to two 30 @-@ year @-@ olds has begun before the District Court of Frankfurt ( Oder ) .
it is accompanied by strict safeguards .
the accused cheered for the start .
they are said to have been active in the rocker scene and then heard about the bandidos .
the public prosecutor accuses them , together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt , of entering and encroaching three men in a car in June 2009 .
all the victims were seriously injured , a man almost lost his leg .
the victims should have been part of the competing group Hell Angels .
one should have been a high @-@ level member from Berlin .
this seemed to be preceded by a hunt for persecution with several cars .
according to the indictment , it was about revival battles and a demonstration of power .
the two defendants were acquitted in a first case in early 2012 .
a court spokesman said at the time that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody error .
the perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized .
the Federal Court of Justice annulled the judgment after the review of the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office and referred it back to the Landgericht for re @-@ trial .
one of the accused is currently in open execution because of another offence .
at the beginning it was mainly a question of the reconstruction of the procedures in the treatise .
as a witness , the then mediating Commissioner was invited .
the focus was on mobile phone calls from defendants and other people who had heard the police .
it is difficult that Rocker almost always abides by - and does not say - a law that they respect .
this also applies to the victims .
in the first process , only one victim had been packed .
prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Public Prosecutor Frankfurt ( Oder ) said on demand that new traces had appeared since the last trial .
eleven more negotiating days are scheduled for the process .
the Wealth Society does not think
the night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but eventually it goes home .
but : hunger is noticeable in people &apos;s bushes on the front @-@ passenger and back seat .
of course , you may be responsible for one cocktail or another !
what is closer than going to the next drive in order to be able to do a little bit ?
I admit that I am happy to be involved when it comes to late in the morning or early in the morning .
a few pommes , a cola , a burger - and then nix like home and bed !
but at home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry discos are noticeable .
what is missing is that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity ? !
on weekends , paper bags are mainly on street and parking places .
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wonder .
are the people too doof to take the bags with home respectful until the next butcher ?
it is not just the case that paper is negotiating the landscape .
bags have also concealed transport facilities such as road maps , causing accidents .
however , what I have said does not reflect on what I have said , it probably does not even know what this word actually means .
if you are travelling more often in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you know what a backbank can look like after a busy night &apos;s sleep : carpets , bottles and other rubbish doors .
there would be a few bags more or less nix - unlike the road , where no one wants to trample on the essentials of others .
I can already see the day when cities and municipalities will be forced to smoke - and demand fast food chains for their bags .
Obama &apos;s Return on Health Policy
after severe criticism , President Obama yesterday made a backtracking on his often repeated , unambiguous promise : &quot; if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . &quot;
after hundreds of thousands of people received a letter of notice from their insurer , the Republicans warned the president in recent days that he had deceived the American public .
yesterday , Obama relative his original promise .
&quot; the vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , &quot; he said in a speech in Boston .
in response to the numerous media reports on dismissals , Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market .
most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than forecast .
&quot; you get a better offer , &quot; he said .
the government said it was not surprising that the five per cent of the population who entered into insurance would have to look for another tariff , because their contract did not comply with the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .
&quot; I would like to say directly to these Americans : they deserve better , &quot; said Sebelius at a hearing before the House of Representatives Energy and Trade Committee in Washington .
Sebelius , responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Acts , said that the launch of the online platform had been &quot; miserable &quot; since October .
&quot; I am as frustrated and angry as anyone else , &quot; she said .
I am determined to regain your confidence .
this claim by a raised Sebelius as a post @-@ incumbent adviser at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the House of Representatives was received after a dispute with Republican MEP Billy Long from Missouri , asking whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare .
after more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius repeatedly challenged why the &quot; architect &quot; of the Affordable Care Acts had not voluntarily waived state @-@ sponsored insurance to complete a tariff at HealthCare.gov , which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans .
Jerusalem Government does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Base
an American government official who wanted to remain anonymous said on Thursday to the American news station CNN that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an air base in Latakia , Syria .
the goal was &quot; rockets and related equipment , &quot; which the Israeli Government feared had been destined for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab channel Al @-@ Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port town of Latakia had been fired on Thursday night from Wednesday to Thursday , and blamed the Israelis .
the Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base point in Latakia , where Russian missile missiles of type S @-@ 125 Newa and a battery of SA @-@ 3 rockets were seen , according to Channel 2 , with a range of 35 kilometres and warheads of up to 70 kilograms .
the Jerusalem government has not officially confirmed the attack .
however , the Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli government official saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack , but is not sure .
one spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said , &quot; We do not comment on these reports . &quot;
in Yedioth Ahronoth &apos;s daily newspaper , the journalist Ron Ben @-@ Yishai stressed that the Syrian regime had previously , sometimes successfully , tried to deliver ground @-@ air missiles to Hezbollah .
the Israeli Government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons is a &quot; red line &quot; that would be followed by a military response .
John Kerry declares in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has &quot; gone too far &quot;
John Kerry indicated , with an unexpected admission , that the US &apos;s defensive stance on its surveillance programs was &quot; inappropriate &quot; in certain cases .
the Foreign Minister also admitted that he , together with Barack Obama , was responsible for switching to &quot; Autopilot &quot; when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA &apos;s spy activities became public .
with the leaked information , the US government has come into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies .
in a video @-@ linked speech at the Open Government Conference in London , Kerry said : &quot; there is no question that the President and I , and others in the government , have heard of a number of things that have gone out almost by autopilot , simply because there was the ability to do what happened to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , 11 September . &quot;
he then admitted , as the first high @-@ level member of the US administration , that US espionage had crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights had been abused .
he said : &apos; in some cases this has gone too far &apos; .
the President is determined to clarify matters and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place .
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process .
however , Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations .
he added : &quot; we are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to escape into the air . &quot;
there is a radical extremism in the world that is anxious to kill people , flee into the air and attack governments .
so what if we were able to catch and stop this before it happens ?
we have indeed prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we have heard about such plans in advance .
meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to allay concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in the fight against terrorism , as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday .
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti @-@ terrorist organisations as a result of the frustration with the National Security Agency &apos;s monitoring .
&quot; it is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board as regards our joint efforts against terrorism , &quot; said Murphy , who is a democrat in the Senate for the first time and is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on External Relations and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger about the NSA programmes .
media reports , according to which the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe , have burdened relations with some US allies , although the head of the secret service said this week that the reports were incorrect and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .
other revelations cited in Snowden &apos;s documents that the NSA monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s mobile phone and up to 34 other leaders worldwide .
the head of the national secret services , James Clapper , defended espionage with allies as necessary and declared that this was common on both sides .
in all this turmoil , Murphy said that his authority was preparing the Congress &apos;s trip to be held this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers .
the names of the other Members participating will be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact route is still being developed .
while Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some &quot; serious words . &quot;
he said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes they have been using for years .
&quot; while we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy , &quot; Murphy says .
meanwhile , John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the resentment of the US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities .
a persistent violation of the jumping gear threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller from using the Bundesliga outward game of FSV Mainz 05 at the FC Augsburg .
Mainz dares to use Nicolai Müller .
tomorrow he will try to train with the team .
until now , he could only do so individually .
&quot; we will decide on his bet in the short term , &quot; said Trainer Thomas Tuchel .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old hopes to have his best goalkeeper with six hits .
the Mainzer has already abandoned the injured service providers Niki Zimling , Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert .
Australians appeal for prison sentence in Thailand
a 21 @-@ year @-@ old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for wrongly claiming that she had been raped by a taxi driver , appealed against the judgment and was released on bail .
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June of making a false statement after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning hours on Sunday 10 June , while two other men held her .
later , however , the recordings of a video camera showed that she had arrived safely in her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend .
the police in Phuket stopped Bamford for two days until they were allowed to think about history .
until the trial she was in police custody on the ground .
Bamford was sentenced to a 15 @-@ day prison sentence in a low @-@ security prison near Phuket , rather than in a prison for adult women .
she is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy League , who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help for his daughter .
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was &quot; extremely concerned &quot; about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have her back in Australia .
&quot; we are of course very concerned , but we hope that it will be back home as soon as possible , &quot; said Tunks .
Bamford appealed against the judgment and is free of charge against a deposit of 50,000 Baht .
Australian reports show that she has been on holiday in Krabi in southern Thailand in the meantime .
it was heard from the Court that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and warned that the appeal could lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison .
however , it is also possible that , following the recent assassination of Michelle Smith in Phuket , Thailand may be trying to improve its troubled tourist image , and that is why there is no doubt about it .
