reflection on the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil rights .
&quot; as trade unions die , middle class jobs die , &quot; said Ellison , a Minnesota democrat , and vice president of the Progressive Caucus in Congress .
that is why I am proud to present the employee authorisation law together with John Lewis , the civil rights officer .
this groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops anti @-@ union forces .
the addition of the national labour law to create a way of discriminating workers to organise a trade union representation in order to bring justice before a civil court - and to obtain damages or penalties - is a useful and necessary initiative .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not American standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what Ellison , Lewis and the other sponsors of her bill propose is to link back to a very American idea .
despite the setbacks experienced by trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan , and other states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize , expand , and respect labor rights .
there was a time when millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath .
when the United States occupied Japan after World War II , General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy .
fully aware that workers and their unions have a role to play in creating a new Japan , they used a language that explicitly recognised that &quot; workers &quot; rights to unification and collective negotiation and action are guaranteed . &quot;
when the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler &apos;s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy .
in recognition of the fact that workers would have to organise themselves and raise their voices in the new nation , the Germans added a clause explicitly stating : &quot; the right to set up associations to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and every profession or profession .
agreements that restrict or seek to reduce this right are null and void ; measures aimed at doing so are illegal .
when former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Human Rights Commission , which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as assumed by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948 , Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that &quot; everyone has the right to form unions to protect their interests . &quot;
for generations , Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
when that country told other countries how to form civil and democratic societies , Americans said that the right to establish a trade union - and that this union should then be allowed to participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected .
indeed , after these rights were attacked in America , it is very wise to look back at the American ideal , whereby working people must have the right to unite and make themselves heard in a free and open society .
as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the workers &quot; movement did not limit the nation &apos;s strength , but increased it .
by raising the standard of living of millions of people , work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production .
those who attack work forget these simple truths , but history keeps them .
history reminds us , and we should .
the formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that made America great in the past , fulfilling the promise of democracy .
judge temporarily stops all abortion clinics in Louisiana forcing them to close down
on Sunday , a US federal judge provisionally stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana , which lawyers say would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state .
this measure , imposed by Bobby Jindal , Governor of Louisiana , in June and intended to enter into force on 1 September , would force doctors carrying out abortions to acquire a patient &apos;s right of admission at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to practice .
however , the judge &apos;s decision means that doctors can temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions while applying for such a right .
&quot; the plaintiff can continue to work in accordance with the law while seeking to obtain these rights , &quot; Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his judgment .
a hearing for the judge will be held within one month to bring about a more permanent decision for the law .
those in favour of abortion welcomed the decision , the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures , saying that doctors would have more time to obtain hospital ID rights .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in Louisiana are escaping a careless law that wants to deprive them of their health and rights , &quot; said Nancy Northup , President and Chair of the Reproductive Rights Centre , which had indicted them on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law .
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment also covered doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the complaint and had also applied for admission rights .
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws , with courts recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi .
key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close down were stopped by a federal judge on Friday .
abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists , as well as the American Medical Association , are unanimous in saying that doctors &quot; rights of admission require unnecessary restrictions .
those opposed to abortion preclude the fact that the measures are designed to protect women &apos;s health , although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics .
only a doctor who carries out abortions in Louisiana has access to patients &apos; rights , informed the Reproduction Rights Centre .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop abortions , that doctor would no longer perform the operation for fear of safety , the group said .
in their arguments against the judgment , representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions while their applications for patients &apos; rights would still be pending .
delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatments result in higher death rates due to egg stock cancer in rural areas .
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have made a video debut for their mother who died in 2007 from ovarian cancer .
women in rural Australia face a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than women in cities .
researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 , and found that only 25 % were alive five years after diagnosis .
the research director Susan Jordan of QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state , mortality was 20 % higher during the study than for those living in urban areas .
small STUFFS : new medicines could slow lung and ovarian cancer
researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years .
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis , type of ovarian cancer , existing precursors and social and economic status also affected survival opportunities .
for older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at the diagnostic stage , the survival rate was lowest .
for those living in rural and remote regions of the state , the risk of mortality was 20 % higher during the study than in urban areas .
although the study did not examine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer , Dr. Jordan suspect that a late diagnosis and a lack of access to the best treatment centres are possible factors .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gynaecological oncology , and these are usually found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to counter the distances , she proposed , as a possible remedy , a strengthening of the service of interfered doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to care for women in their place of residence , as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region .
Dr Jordan said that , regardless of geographical status , the study revealed a poor long @-@ term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
the study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
in March 2013 , Elisha Neave , a young 33 @-@ year @-@ old mother from the Golden Coast , discovered that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .
garden centres regret falling house numbers
the decline , together with an increase in the number of homeowners under the age of 35 , could result in garden centres losing tens of thousands of pounds a year if today &apos;s young consumers reach the &quot; core age group for horticultural products , &quot; according to a study by HTA .
the report states that , on average , tenants spend 55 % of the amount that people spend on their garden with their homes .
the increase in people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens , the popular method of asphalting gardens for parking purposes and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry , where an estimated £ 5 billion is sold annually .
in the London area , where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 % to 43 % over a period of 6 years , the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported .
the HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants .
Guy Barter , Chief Garrison Advisor for the RHS , said : &quot; container gardeners are very popular with tenants , for example , because they can take their plants with them when they move . &quot;
the HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &quot; golden age &quot; of garden retailing due to rising house ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid @-@ 1990s .
he also predicted an improved market situation this year due to better weather conditions in March and April last year .
the protest movement in Pakistan led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the cleric Tahirul Qadri continues .
in the capital , Islamabad , some 1000 demonstrators stormed the public television station PTV .
information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings .
the station stopped operating for about 40 minutes , but is now sending it back .
at the same time , some 3000 demonstrators tried to reach Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif &apos;s residence .
about a kilometre away from it , they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped with security forces .
the police used tears .
the demonstrators called for Sharif &apos;s resignation , but he refused .
meanwhile , the country &apos;s army calls for a political solution to the conflict , &quot; waste without time and without violence . &quot;
after a meeting in the Headquarters on Sunday evening , the military said : &quot; the army remains committed to ensuring state security . &quot;
the military has played an important role in Pakistan , and has already spread more frequently .
opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Premier Sharif of cheating at last May &apos;s parliamentary election .
the protests were escalated at the weekend , after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to enter Sharif &apos;s residence .
three people had been killed .
Turkey appoints US diplomat for espionage report
the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the country &apos;s oldest US diplomats to provide information on US and British espionage in Turkey .
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the US Embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday .
the German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency , Edward Snowden , showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British intelligence services .
according to Turkish news agencies , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries were spying each other .
a previous report that the most important secret service in Germany , Ankara , was also targeted by the Turkish Government .
warning strike : local leaders face consequences for commuters
the nationwide warning strike by the drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW .
all transport companies , including long @-@ distance , regional and S @-@ Bahn transport ,
the main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport .

said the district chairman of the trade union Deutscher Locomotive Guide ( GDL ) , Sven Schmitte , in Düsseldorf .
we expect significant failures .
there are no regional priorities .
the main thrust of the warning strike was freight transport .
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do its utmost to minimise the impact .
however , the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike , so it is difficult to predict the consequences .
police Chief of Magaluf charged with corruption
the prosecutors presented evidence to the office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday of blackmail by police officers and staff of the city of Calvià .
the head of the Calvià police on the island of Mallorca was arrested in the notorious Magaluf Binge @-@ Drinking Hotspot following allegations of corruption by businessmen and bartholders .
head of the Commission , José Antonio Navarro , has been detained following allegations of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena , the street where most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located .
according to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario , prosecutors presented evidence to the office of the prosecutor for corruption in Mallorca on Friday of blackmail by police officers and staff of the city of Calvià .
two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Civil Guard in connection with the allegations of corruption and are interviewed with Navarro by a judge .
the Spanish national newspaper ABC reported that the angry night club owners said that the nepotism of the authorities had a serious impact on their business .
&quot; it is no longer a question of making money , it is a question of survival , &quot; said one of the businessmen .
let our livelihoods disappear .
we have nothing to lose .
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing a 18 @-@ year @-@ old British tourist who went to 24 men during a tour to Fellatio .
since then , the island authorities have tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the infamous alcohol drinks pub tours .
the Playhouse Club , in which the Fellatio incident took place , was forced to close for one year , while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage have to pay a penalty of € 55.000 ( $ 73.000 ) together .
the tourist resort of Magaluf , which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers , is also known for numerous alcohol @-@ related accidents , including the trend of &quot; Balconing , &quot; where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool .
the first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide airport
the FRÜHLING has given southern Italy a winter surprise , with fierce spectacles and strong wind that affected flights from Adelaide airport .
in the evening until 9 p.m. a further 5mm of rain fell on the city , after 6.6mm , which had already fallen down to Sunday at night .
the last precipitation was the result of a series of short , stormy sleeves , including a walk that began just before 20 : 00 and caused almost 4mm in about 10 minutes .
after the winter of last week provided for an early dose of spring , temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of just 15.8 ° C.
the bad weather conditions probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide .
the aircraft should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m. , but was hit by a storm - a sudden change in the wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to go through .
at that time wind strikes reached about 50 km / h on the ground at Adelaide Airport .
the flight data showed that the aircraft had to start on a second landing flight and finally stopped at around 8.40 p.m.
the flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights , including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney .
for Adelaide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday , with possible displays .
Matthies says : high time for large networks
in view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high @-@ tech switchgear centers , our columnist Bernd Matthies dissolves with a highly familiar electronic accessory .
as I write this here , my view of the spiral cable connecting the listener to the phone falls , and I think : Boah , how retro is it ?
but there is one thought behind this : if the cable were not there , all the listeners would fly around in the house without hesitation , and that would be much more retro .
anyway , the eceltronic ( eceltronic ?
no , typing errors : electronic ) sector the rule that today &apos;s world novelty is tomorrow &apos;s electric scrap - outdated .
and those who still have a tube TV in the living room today , for example , simply say that they reject television in principle .
why these considerations ?
because the ifa &apos;s applets on the radio tower this week once again show us our absolute incompetence in electronic matters .
the shop , which used to be blindly controlled by a washing machine and CD player , does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread out in front of him with an unfathomable whim of experts : &quot; connected Home , Wearables , Health Care and Urban Technologies &quot; promises us the press office .
yes , is it ?
what should we talk to people who apparently voluntarily spread such Quark ?
in fact , for some 20 years , the main issue has been that we should link up our house .
so that the yoghurt itself can be ordered , so that the fire detector tells us on holiday on the Maldives that it burns in the working room .
and would it not be wonderful if we had air conditioning from the office on our early arrival ... ?
yes , that requires air conditioning .
but a dream will certainly come true soon : we lift our watch , say it &quot; sucking ! &quot; - and at home the vacuum cleaner is out .
wrong .
everything amounts to nothing less than a revolution : &quot; the boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred , &quot; an industry expert racks , you can connect the washing machine with a headphone , the steam garer sends the weather report and the data bricks show how long the pizza in the oven still takes , but nothing is useful .
we also know from day @-@ to @-@ day practice : if a new @-@ fashioned device is needed urgently , the battery is guaranteed to be empty .
another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions .
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in air protection areas , while rocket and murderers struck their communities during the 50 @-@ day war between Israel and Hamas , and the Gaza schools remained closed , while the area recovered from the fighting .
the start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities of rockets in southern Israel , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern town of Ashdod , staff of the &quot; Pashosh &quot; kindergarten , who was hit by a rocket , arrived before the students arrived from the walls and shooting walls .
&quot; we are a bit afraid , but are excited , &quot; said Ronit Bart , resident in Kibutz Saad and there English teacher .
many children from our area urgently need a return to a routine .
her 11 @-@ year @-@ old daughter Shani Bart said it feels &quot; a bit funny &quot; to suddenly go back to school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we did not leave the House at all , &quot; she said .
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support .
until a ceasefire broke the war last week , thousands of residents of border communities , such as Saad in their homes , or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the missile and murderer fire .
many of the inhabitants of Nahal Oz , a community near the border with Gaza where a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade , are still reluctant to return .
the Ministry of Education announced that around a dozen families have not yet returned .
their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools .
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot , a border city with Gaza , which is heavily influenced by Palestinian terror .
he called on the children to learn a lot and said , &quot; We will make sure that they acquire knowledge and offer you security . &quot;
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an indefinite ceasefire .
the cease @-@ fire caused an immediate end to the fighting , but important issues remain unresolved , such as Hamas &apos;s call for the lifting of the Israeli @-@ Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the re @-@ opening of air and sea ports in Gaza .
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the handover of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to start this month in Egypt .
in the war , more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed , three quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children , according to estimates from the Palestinians and the UN .
Israel denies these claims and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters , but did not provide any concrete evidence of this information .
on the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including one Thai worker , were killed .
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and murderers during the fighting on Israeli cities , most in the south of the country .
meanwhile , the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
the Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza Strip , and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protected areas and the fighting continues , the education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week .
&quot; I hope the school will soon be reopened so that we can continue to learn , just as children in the world and Jewish children , &quot; said Mohammad Amara , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza City .
by choice in Saxony : CDU @-@ Vize Strobl questions NPD prohibition procedure
in view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony , CDU @-@ Bundesvize Thomas Strobl declared himself in favour of an end to the current NPD prohibition procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court .
Berlin - Laut CDU @-@ Bundesvize Thomas Strobl should end the ongoing prohibition procedure against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court .
&quot; the NPD performs worse than the last time , &quot; said Strobl , who is also head of CDU in Baden @-@ Württemberg , the &quot; Leipzig People &apos;s newspaper . &quot;
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that leads me to conclude that the NPD is being fought politically rather than before the Constitutional Court .
the NPD had almost failed at the five percent threshold in Sunday &apos;s vote .
a first attempt to ban the far @-@ right party had failed in 2003 , because constitutional protection had informants at the NPD &apos;s head .
in December 2013 , after a long preparation , the Bundesrat submitted a new application in Karlsruhe .
the Federal Government and Bundestag did not join .
Harburg : tents for new refugees
refugees are now accommodated in tents at Neulner Square .
the main reception for refugees in Harburg burns from all seams .
now the Home Office has put together three tents of the Red Cross .
district politicians were informed only a short time ago - they are not enthusiastic .
said Britta Herrmann , Green Group Chairman of the Harburg District Assembly .
your party calls for the Harburg district administration to provide unused houses for accommodation .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
the reasons for overcrowding in the first wave are the onslaught of those in need of assistance - and the fact that the authorities are unable to provide sufficient space in subsequent facilities .
many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months .
house prices have experienced the highest winter rise in seven years , showing a widely observed index .
the RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August , according to Monday &apos;s RP data .
as a result of this increase , the overall increase in June , July and August is 4.2 % , the largest increase in winter months since 2007 .
the annual price increase was 10.9 % , more than twice the increase in the 12 months to August 2013 , but increases were not evenly spread across the country .
RP Data &apos;s research director , Tim Lawless , announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two @-@ tier market .
RP Data &apos;s figures show that house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 % last year , while in Melbourne they rose by 11.7 % .
the following markets are Adelaide , Brisbane and Darwin , where prices rose by five and six percent on average .
at the other end of the scale is Canberra , which was hit hard by cuts in government spending , where prices rose by just 1.4 % over the year .
Mr Lawless went on to say that , with the beginning of spring , there would be an increase in the number of real estate on sale over the next few months , which would &apos; test &apos; the market .
&quot; if you look at the consistently high rate of auction prices , a generally fast sales rate , and the consistently low rate of interest , it is likely that home prices will rise even further in the next three months , &quot; he said .
in an opinion to the New Press , he contradicts the statements made by the Managing Director Peer Medau and assesses &quot; as a field hero . &quot;
this is not the style of the university , as stated in the communication .
for example , the Medau family had been informed orally in mid @-@ June about the intention of the university .
said Pötzl .
at the same time , it points out that the plans are not &apos; predefined or even decisions &apos; , but that there are &apos; preferences &apos; .
the extension of the narrow road to the castle is also less dramatic than the Medaus feared .
there was and is not talk of a nine @-@ metre @-@ wide road .
it goes up to the present level by 5.50 meters , which is a metre wider than before , &quot; explains Pötzl .
the argument put forward by the Medau operators that their free and school @-@ owned parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future , does not want to let Pötzl apply .
no savings are made at all because , as with other public parking spaces , this can now be solved intelligently .
thinking of residents
the &quot; Bergwichtel &quot; crèche , which is located on the site and which would lead to the entrance to the park deck , is said to be &quot; not affected &quot; by the President of the University .
on the contrary , he says that &quot; this is not only about the crèche , but also about the residents at the entrance to the Friedrich Streib @-@ Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring Realschule .
we are talking about much more than Mr Medau &apos;s special interests , &quot;
whether the criticism of the pedigree &apos;s parents , the extension of the street would mean that one of the few natural spots in Coburg is &quot; justified , &quot; the reader can decide for himself . &quot;
at the beginning of October , Pötzl , together with the State Building Office Bamberg , intends to inform the city councils about the construction development of the university by 2020 , &quot; and in this context address the importance of new development . &quot;
peer Medau informed the parents of the nursery about the school &apos;s plans last week .
this means that the access to the new parking deck should not be over the campus and the Friedrich @-@ Streib @-@ Straße , but over the Medau mountain .
this would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended to about one kilometre in length .
according to Medaus calculations , traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would thus be tenfold .
there are about 2000 vehicles per day .
so far , the city has not wanted to comment on the project .
Glandorf resigns from Handball National Team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old of the Bundesligisten SG Flensburg @-@ Handewitt cited health problems for this decision .
I did not make the decision easy ; it has matured for several months .
it is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team , &quot; said the 2007 World Champion on his Facebook page .
it is therefore taking stock of 167 national matches and 576 goals for Germany to retire internationally .
he is now no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson because he wants to go to death hunting for a few years .
Glandorf had a long and good conversation with the Icelanders , who announced his cadre for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday .
his ideas and approaches have inspired me as much as my long @-@ standing fellow players and my successors will be .
for my club , however , I would like to be available in a healthy way over the next few years , which requires longer regenerative courses that do not allow for the current double burden .
the left @-@ wing countries had to fear his career in 2012 after a fermentation infection .
due to Achilles &quot; problems , he had been treated by team doctors from the German Handballbundes ( DHB ) with a cortisonic injection , which later triggered a strong inflammation .
an emergency operation and two further interventions followed .
then Glandorf had announced an action against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass without trace .
I have some health sites that I can no longer ignore .
after the three foot operations that took place in 2012 , I never got my blood pressure right .
there are some other wear @-@ related complaints .
as early as the beginning of the year , I noticed that although I can control my head , I cannot deceive my body , &quot; Glandorf explained in the interview to the magazine &quot; Handball Time . &quot;
he would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency .
&quot; when all the knitting is done , I am always ready to talk , &quot; said the double family father to the magazine .
however , I can count the years in which I can still play handball in one hand .
I must also say that , after my long stay in hospital in 2012 , I have become quite humble about my health .
after my career I would like to be able to go at least to some extent .
in addition to the World Cup title 2007 and the winner of the Champions League in 2014 , he won the EHF Cup in 2008 ( HSG Nordhorn ) and in 2010 ( TBV Lemgo ) .
in 2012 he also secured with Flensburg the European Cup of Cup winners .
German economy shrinking by 0.2 % in spring
the crises around the globe have slowed down the German economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product fell by 0.2 % from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter .
this informed the Federal Statistical Office , confirming preliminary calculations .
consumption alone boosted the economy in the spring , while investment declined .
foreign trade also slowed the economy .
thanks to the strong annual start @-@ up , GDP growth for the first half of 2013 is 0.8 % higher than in the second half of 2013 .
Horstmar was the starting point and destination of the &quot; Münsterland @-@ Mooiste , &quot; which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday .
the Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch &quot; Fietzendriver &quot; on Sunday .
the largest cycling association in the Netherlands , NTFU , organised the so @-@ called &quot; Münsterlande @-@ Mooiste . &quot;
it &apos;s about the largest cycling tour across the Münsterland , the cycling paradise near the Netherlands .
more than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour through the Münsterland .
the tour was advertised in various trade magazines .
we come from Den Helder and travelled overnight to take part in this tour .
we would also like to get to know the Münsterland in this way , &quot; the cyclists enjoyed the route through the districts of Steinfurt , Borken and Coesfeld .
after registration in the club house of the Sta County .
Katharina went on a small &quot; peace trip &quot; through the city over the Wall , where the start was made .
the route , which was published for three different categories , led back to Horstmar via the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude , 120 kilometres with 1475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres with 1775 metres of altitude , cyclists demonstrated their good condition .
they were fed on the road in Havixbeck and Billerbeck .
the main organizer Jos ter Huerne and Mayor &apos;s Representative Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a great experience for everyone involved .
the organisation ran smoothly and there were no negative events , &quot; Heinz Lölfing concludes a positive conclusion of this event .
unfortunately not as many participants as the organiser had hoped , probably due to bad weather forecasts and tomorrow &apos;s rain .
&quot; we look back in 2015 with hopefully nice weather on August 30th or during another weekend , &quot; but the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland again and the organizers planned a new edition .
Konstantin Weckers recklessly honest memoirs
it is actually more philosophical testimony than biography , what Konstantin Wecker , Liedermacher , Pacific , policeman activist , ex @-@ prisoner , brought to paper in &quot; monks and warriors &quot; on 287 pages .
not chronologically , but rather more thought @-@ tanks for thought , the Munich @-@ born on June 1 , 1947 wrote his memoirs , each chapter initiated by a suitable lyrics text .
and he is ruthlessly honest : from Onanie as a Gymnasiast to shoplifting and drug use , he does not cause human weakness .
also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
wide space also takes abstract but even more important terms : love , soul , ego , being in the meantime , spirituality - all this he tries to go to the bottom , in a very philosophical but also very personal way .
and he also explains his pacifism , his social critique , his political commitment - and also how he has shaped not only music ( the opera lover became soul and rock musician ) , but also his prison stay .
the latter brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk , who is &quot; created by subtraction , &quot; as he says , &quot; leaving everything unnecessary . &quot;
however , there are also short anecdotes between all the high mental views to the earth : for example , about smells in a pub frequented by GIs , or a crazy car ride where he approached a tree frontal .
here , too , he is reckless .
Lenny Henry : my father never took me into my arm .
never said &quot; I love you &quot;
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaica immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
his father , who died when Henry 19 was worked in a factory and her relationship was limited .
Henry rehearses for a comedy , Rudy &apos;s Rare Records , which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4 .
the soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
but Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments .
he visited &quot; many &quot; therapies after the death of his mother , and Henry is concerned about his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
one never saw his face , only heard his voice : &quot; stop the crack .
let your sister in peace .
go ahead !
I want to look at cricket .
my older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the form of beer glasses or the beauty of a cricket strike .
I never had such a conversation with him .
much of my life he was this serious type in the corner that the newspaper read .
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley , and although the conditions are better than at his father &apos;s time , he gained an insight into how life might have been for him .
it is now a bit brighter , but they are dark , smoked , deep stylist labyrinth with flames and smoke and a lot of soot .
my father put himself in the bath earlier and then he could be heard slowly how to sing because he could wash the foundry of himself .
when I walked around there , it became clear to me that he had done so for years to put the food on the table , and my respect for him increased .
however , Henry grew up as a child without love for his parents .
my father never surrounded me , he never said &quot; I love you . &quot;
only when my mother went badly towards the end of her life did we begin to say &quot; I love you , I love you , I love you . &quot;
through his own daughter Billie , with Dawn French , he could share the love he had missed as a child .
could you stop with &quot; I love you &quot; ?
stop embracing me !
Papa , I am 22 !
with Dawn French .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
it is still friends with French , with whom he was married for 25 years .
Dawn is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
Henry &apos;s mother was a diabetic .
this contributed to their death .
so when I became very , very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said &quot; You must be radical .
so I went through this fitness and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
it is very difficult .
and it is tough .
nobody likes to eat carrots .
Henry &apos;s career changes may be reflected in his elegant , short @-@ cut bart .
since he was praised by critics for his Othello , he has been captured by the theatre .
the comedy of the mistakes followed , and then fences of August Wilson .
this is a different experience from the Sitcoms and comedies that have filled up their busy working life .
he began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him .
his television career began in the mid @-@ seventies . &quot; I was the only black imitator / comedian on television for quite a long time . &quot;
he learned at work .
I had to learn not only from the public eye , but also from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke narrative machine , while I was a star through television , and that was really difficult .
lenny 1975 at New Faces
as his manager had the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show , a light entertainment program in which people &quot; painted black , &quot; Henry performed his comedy there for more than five years .
my family was very unpleasant .
I would have liked it never happened , but I do not regret that I have done it .
it was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience .
but this &quot; years of award @-@ winning light pillar of British television &quot; was also a &quot; grotesque parody of black people . &quot;
Henry worked on an alternative comedycircle in the eighties by introducing figures that both mocked and celebrated British black culture .
the first series of the Lenny Henry Show was on show in 1984 , and in the 1990s he was known among others as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef !
advertising , documentaries , TV series and film roles shaped his next decade , but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 , he thought : &quot; what do you do next , Len , because it feels like it all as if you just move the time around or step a little on the spot . &quot;
then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What &apos;s So Great About ... ?
the first episode was about Shakespeare .
on Shakespeare I was quite allergic .
I had never really learned anything about him in school and thought it was mostly a middle class domain , white in strumpfhosen and a coal head in the front .
so I was very afraid .
all we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench said &quot; You should try it .
do not do it badly if you do not know what you are talking about .
take a few words into the mouth , and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much .
Henry performed 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic .
I felt I could do that .
it was almost as if someone had put my head right .
&quot; this is what it is about , it is a serious thing , take them seriously , rub your text , search a bit .
the samples were brutal , and I read this piece for months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car accident , and that simply did not happen .
and soon he appeared in the comedy of the mistakes .
suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when I thought &quot; Oh , you changed you . &quot;
there was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience .
&quot; a small voice told me &quot; You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they repair the computer . &quot;
instead , the stage leader announced that the idea would continue once the problem had been resolved .
I went out of the stage and said something in me &quot; Oh , thank God . &quot;
I am not responsible for this .
I can leave that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stick to your role . &quot;
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
learning the text of fences was challenging .
panic is very good , which strengthens the aspirations .
that too was a good thing , so it is like a great shield of the gods who tell me &quot; This is your destiny . &quot;
he says this , of course , with a deaf voice .
so I remain there .
I really love that .
I love to be in a sample room .
Henry , however , still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has gone through humorous outbursts , while constantly imitating people .
I decided not to make a stand @-@ up comedy because I think that this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous .
if you &apos;re looking for it forever , you &apos;re driving in front of a wall .
I sometimes appear live in the Apollo , if I like it , but overall I don &apos;t get as much as I did before .
I ask him whether he will ever make a stand @-@ up comedytour .
the fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning , a middle part and the end of a journey - I do not think I ever want to give up .
is this his new incarnation ?
I think so .
I am happy to be an actor .
it &apos;s fun .
one always tells a story , and that is great .
I love stories .
people love stories .
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen &apos;s capital
in the conflict between Shia Huthi rebels and Yemeni government , the Huthis has called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa .
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday , said a Speaker of the Huthi party &quot; Ansar Allah . &quot;
access to Parliament has also been blocked .
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital .
according to the online issue of the newspaper &quot; Yemen Post , &quot; Huthi leader Abdulmalik al @-@ Huthi called for action on Sunday evening .
Huthi threatened to further escalate the conflict , according to the leaf , if his demands were not met .
the Shia huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni @-@ ruled Yemen and are demanding the resignation of the government .
the Huthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks .
some 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access routes of Sanaa .
in the surrounding area there are always bloody battles with the Yemeni army .
Kenya registers officials to contain ghost workers
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometric to remove &quot; ghosts &quot; from government pay lists .
employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid , was a government communication .
the government estimates that thousands of people will still receive pay after leaving the public service .
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the civil service when he took office in 2013 .
at the beginning of this year &apos;s audit , it was found that at least $ 1 million ( £ 700,000 ) per month were lost in payments for &quot; ghost workers &quot; and other abusive financial practices .
the government estimates that salaries will continue to be paid to accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service , says Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi .
all officials will now have to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded , a government message was sent .
those who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll , the communication continued .
&quot; this approach will make a significant contribution to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of civil servants and also by redressing the payroll at both levels of government - eliminating the &quot; ghosts , &quot; said Anne Waiguru , Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning .
the scandal surrounding the art adviser Helge Achenbach will be brought to justice for the first time on 11 November .
five heirs to Berthold Albrecht , son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht , claim € 19.4 million in civil proceedings at Düsseldorf &apos;s Landgericht ( Landgericht Düsseldorf ) and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings .
this informed a court speaker on Monday .
it is stated in the plea that Achenbach had cheated in buying works of art and vintage timers and Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices .
as a result , the agreed commission would have been higher .
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for € 121 million .
children need roots and wings
he was at school for 44 years , 23 of which were head of school .
from this time on , Manfred Richter knows many congenial Petershauser and Kollbacher from their time as a pupil .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but always supported by his quest to see people in the student .
the snow slope is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains .
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland .
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau / Nordböhmen , now Trutnov .
after four years of high school he was interested in teaching .
one year later , the Sudeten Germans were expropriated .
within half an hour the family had to leave their house .
after a few months in a camp , it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight waggon .
so it swallowed judges into the Upper Engadine Senkendorf .
teaching took place in Bamberg .
Manfred Richter had to walk six miles per week to the nearest railway station , drive by train to Bamberg , go to school three kilometres across the city and return in the evening .
after two months , Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross home in Bamberg : together with up to 15 people in a sleeping room .
in 1951 he made the first state exam and in 1954 after three years of Lehramtsanwarter .
since Oberfranken had no free teachers for him , he moved to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1 , 1954 .
the &quot; Fräulein @-@ Zimmer &quot; was his first &quot; office apartment &quot; in the school building .
in 1958 he obtained a three @-@ room apartment in the newly built teaching house next to the school .
this house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 , after the school had been dissolved in Kollbach in 1968 .
until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen @-@ Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen .
from 1968 / 69 they were summarised in Petershausen in the present town hall .
when the school association Indersdorf was founded , only the primary school remained in the village .
in order to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school , the then Rektor Georg Sigl moved to Karlovy Vary - and Manfred Richter became his successor .
but Petershausen grew , and since September 1982 the children and their teachers have been able to obtain today &apos;s construction , which was extended in 1997 after Judge &apos;s retirement .
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of then @-@ mayor Ludwig Götz , who also built a workshop room at municipal costs and cellars during the 1997 enlargement , although this was not eligible under the school building guidelines .
&quot; Mayor Götz was very schoolfriendly , &quot; Judge remembered .
in his entire career , Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who responded to a school council unit on justice and justice : &quot; you must never forget love . &quot; Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher .
&quot; we must give children two things : roots and wings , &quot; says the 84 @-@ year @-@ old .
and he had to know : &quot; this doesn &apos;t always succeed . &quot; whether he only means his pupils or his own six children , is not quite clear .
in any case , Judge Tun was sometimes unconventional .
when students test , they did not get criminal work from him and were not deferred to sit down .
at the expense of the community , judges had two pairs of boxing gloves created and let the two contrasts compete against each other , even if there was to be a pitcher .
for the good of the school , Judge served as a rector with the then mayor Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) .
after retiring , he moved the non @-@ partisan judge to stand for the municipal council at least as the last one on the CSU list in 1996 .
but judges were elected six and joined the CSU .
180 km in three days
hr4 @-@ RADTOUR 700 cyclists enter the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten stopovers .
if cyclists make rust on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten Rast , this is nothing special in itself .
on Friday , however , the number of vacations alone made the impression : the 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Schottener Alteburgpark .
under the motto &quot; Cycling and celebrate on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig , &quot; the participants had met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and attended a concert by Van Baker &amp; Band .
on Friday it was serious : the cyclists took the first stage , which attacked 60 kilometres over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and then to Scots .
in Bad Salzhausen , the athletes were greeted by Mayor Hans @-@ Peter seum , who had started cycling in Bad Vilbel , and by Petra Schwing @-@ Döring , Head of Bad Salzhausen .
in order to freshen up body and mind , all kinds of good things had been prepared : the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder @-@ Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple , Chechen , Streusel and Käsekuchen , which miraculously munched the brave cyclists .
&quot; such cakes can only bake landwives , &quot; a participant from Aulendiebach praised while ordering another piece .
cold refreshments could be obtained on the tavern of Geiß @-@ Nidda .
the &quot; Duo Bravo &quot; entertained visitors with well @-@ known melodies from operetta and musicals and harvested enthusiastic applause .
the beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing .
a gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; he deserved it , after all he has already fortified already crafted bicycle chains . &quot;
meanwhile , the mayor and manager had to work : they were interviewed at the fountain in front of Reporter Rainer Janke &apos;s drinking spa and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen .
Promotionchef Tobias Hagen , since the first hr4 cycle tour in 2004 as a tour leader , could only be brief , since he had plenty to do with local technology .
his pickup truck , in which he communicated with three phones and one radio device with his staff and the 15 @-@ member motorcycle team of the police Hessen , wrote Facebook entries and made reports , also needed a check .
&quot; most of the participants come from the Rhine @-@ Main area , &quot; he said , &quot; but also from Gießen or Fulda , from Lauterbach or the Taunus , and even from many cities in Westphalia , cyclists travelled .
the number of participants depends on the accommodation capacity available .
in category I , participants are accommodated in hotels , in category II in collective accommodation .
from the spa , the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up again after one and a half hours : &quot; Tschüss ! &quot;
&quot; it was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen ! &quot;
after arrival in Scots , the group was allowed to pause for a short break .
but in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark .
under the direction of the Schotte Gesellschaft für Tourismus- und Stadtmarketing ( GTS ) , the park had received a beautiful festive atmosphere and , of course , it had prepared delicacies , such as flammkuchen with well @-@ cooled spring white .
Mayor Susanne Schaab , GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner @-@ Sachs welcomed the visitors in his role as Executive Board member of ADAC Hessen @-@ Thüringen .
the three were intentionally pleased with the &quot; many farms in Scots . &quot;
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage .
in spite of the sporty activity on the bike , the opportunity to swim in the open air was seized .
among the guests there were more and more people who were attracted by the good mood and the great char of cyclists .
on the second day the stations Birstein , Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern - were on the programme for cyclists .
yesterday , after 180 kilometres of Radelns , athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel .
dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for &quot; conspiracy &quot; against the government
a total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey due to suspicion of &quot; conspiracy against the government , &quot; reported local media agencies .
the police authorities did not comment directly .
among the arrested are 14 senior policemen , reports hurriyet Daily News .
some of them participated in corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers last December .
in July , a number of Turkish policemen were arrested for allegedly setting up an organised criminal association and calling telephone numbers .
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ( who was then Prime Minister ) described her actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric Fethulla Güllen against him and others in power positions .
not all children in Ukraine return to school
schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday ( September 1 ) after the summer holidays .
this day is traditionally an important day for families and , like thousands of other Ukrainian parents , Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school .
he told journalists waiting there that not all schools had reopened , but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations :
the September celebrations were not held in every school .
the sky is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful sky .
the whole of Ukraine , a huge common Ukrainian front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
Aleksan Pastukhow , school manager of the school in Slawjansk who visits Jazenjuk &apos;s daughter , spoke in Russian .
we hope that peace will finally be restored and that children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their lives .
the first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated , with children wearing embroidered shirts , holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers .
with Rona Fairhead , the BBC has perhaps found the great director it needs .
it meets with a proud fame from the banking world , media management , and the inner circle of the Tory Party .
and it has its own frontal experience .
her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co . , where she moved to Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , ICI and the media world of Pearson .
she was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when Pearson &apos;s senior post went to a younger male colleague .
their compensation was supposedly almost £ 1 million .
their political ranking is also solid .
she was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne , the former chairman of BP , when he was looking for more private @-@ sector knowledge in Whitehall : she became adviser to the cabinet .
her husband is a former Tory Council member .
as early as May , I described the role of the chairman with a poisoned wine .
not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
trust works in two directions : inward to the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC , but also externally as a voice of public concern and concern when things go wrong .
this creates an almost untenable duopoly that calls for a complete reform .
but what new president would risk standing up , beating everything , and dismissing an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while perhaps doing so for himself .
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many are still interested in seeing the BBC diminished - power , money , and status overtaken .
while the competition is approaching and new technologies threaten old , comfortable collateral , the upcoming negotiation of the licensing fees for the BBC poses particular risks .
for the modest sum of £ 145.50 per year , the British public is buying in the most certainly largest media company in the world .
the BBC tells a good story : it says that it reaches 96 % of all households and that it costs only 40 pence per day .
and , apparently , the BBC is rising upwards on the popularity scale : 53 % support it today , compared to 31 % 10 years ago .
the vision and usage habits of the BBC have changed : I get news headlines today on my mobile phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer .
but it remains a very beloved and significant institution .
she needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she has found him .
Perry from Texas says that diminishing tweet was not authorized
a tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas , Rick Perry , on Sunday contained a downgrading remark about the Democratic District Prosecutor , who is at the center of a criminal indictment of him for abuse of authority .
the tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one of Perry &apos;s user accounts that quit the previous one .
a tweet has just been sent from my account , which was not authorized by me .
&quot; I do not endorse the Tweet and have deleted it , &quot; he said .
Perry staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments .
although Perry &apos;s official account tweets ran out , it was not clear who actually served the feed .
in the former Tweet , an unfavourable picture was drawn of the district prosecutor of Travis County , Rosemary Lehmberg , who was convicted of driving drunkenness in April 2013 .
Perry vetoed financial support for her office when she refused to resign , leading to an indictment of Perry - who might be a presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month .
the text of the tweet reads : &quot; I do not always drunk with the triple permitted alcohol level ... but when I do it , I dress Governor Perry when he spells it out . &quot;
I am the most drunken democrat in Texas .
Lehmberg &apos;s office was not responsible for conducting the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry .
this was led by Michael McCrum , a special prosecutor from San Antonio , who was chosen by a Republican judge .
Perry called the indictment a political trick .
his top @-@ class team of legal advisers applied to the judge charged with the case to dismiss the indictment , arguing that the law against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas is inconspicuous .
Perry stopped $ 7.5 million of government funds to the Public Integrity Unit of the state - established in Travis County and found in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign .
this veto caused a public complaint from a left @-@ wing Watchdog group .
Perry &apos;s official account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous .
after finishing his fifth in the election sessions in Iowa in 2012 , Perry responded to speculation that he would stop popping a photo of himself near a lake , saying &quot; South Carolina , we come ! &quot;
Berkeley declares housing market &quot; normal &quot; again
one of London &apos;s most prominent builders pointed out that the housing market in the south @-@ east of England has returned to normal levels .
home homes in the capital were hotly sought @-@ after and the subject of huge price increases , prompting the Bank of England to set caps on mortgage loans in June , owing to widespread fear of a credit bubble .
Tony Pidgley , founder and CEO of the high @-@ class construction company Berkeley said on Monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013 , &quot; adding that this offers a &quot; stable handling environment . &quot;
the housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn , as foreign buyers pushed into the capital .
according to the register office , prices in the urban area rose sharply last year alone by 18.5 % , far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole .
Berkeleys &quot; average selling prices for private , inexpensive , and student offers rose by about one @-@ fifth last year and reached £ 423,000 at the end of April .
but a stronger pound has made real estate in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric for a possible &quot; housing tax &quot; before the general elections next May .
the London real estate broker Foxton warned last week that the April mortgage market report , which presented tighter credit procurement rules , would lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year .
new data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July , which also suggests that the housing market is cooling .
Hamptions International , another real estate agency , corrected its forecast for the rise in housing prices in London for 2015 to 3 % , on the basis of an already weakening house price awareness .
the volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea , Mayfair and Kensington has now fallen by a quarter year after year , according to Makler WA Ellis .
nevertheless , the desire to have a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing , as the due amounts for futures sales amount to more than £ 2.2 billion .
Mr Pidgley added : &quot; the demand for the right , well @-@ planned product at the best locations remained stable and the result was stable sales . &quot;
in June , the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the pre @-@ crisis peak in 2007 .
the annual pre @-@ tax result rose by 40 percent to £ 280 million annually , while sales rose by 18 percent to £ 1.6 billion .
in a communication on Monday before the company &apos;s annual meeting , Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley is expected to be in line with current market expectations this year .
analysts agree that the annual pre @-@ tax result is £ 450 million .
Berkeley shares were fixed in London in the afternoon at £ 23.96 .
naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence performance at the 85th Oscarveranstaltung .
naked photos of the Oscarpreist Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a &quot; master list &quot; of pictures of another 100 starlets .
a representative of the star from &quot; The Tribute of Panem &quot; confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine and accused the hacker of &quot; blatant violation of privacy . &quot;
the authorities have been notified and will follow those who post the stolen photos from Jennifer Lawrence .
the photos originally posted on the photo @-@ sharing page 4chan were allegedly created by a gap in Apple &apos;s online storage system icloud .
it is not sure how many of the images are true , although Winstead , star from &quot; Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world &quot; also condemned the hack on Twitter .
&quot; to those of you who see photos taken by my husband and I years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are so satisfied with you , &quot; wrote Winstead on Twitter .
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series &quot; iCarly &quot; and &quot; Victorious , &quot; however , denied that the photos were pictures of her and tweetete &quot; These so @-@ called nude pictures of me are falsified , people .
let &apos;s be clear about the beginnings .
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman of Popstar Ariana Grande withdrew the authenticity of the alleged photos from her .
exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson &apos;s highly praised new novel on love and the letter &quot; J . &quot;
they were shattered , so one could best describe it , they slowly got rid of themselves like a cardboard that was left standing in the rain .
occasionally , a woman told him that he was too serious , exhausting , intensive , distanced , and perhaps a little scratched .
and then shake his hand .
he knew kratzürstig .
he was stachelig , as in Igel , yes .
the last victim of this stubbornness was a recent affair , which had been more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life than otherwise , and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction .
Ailinn Solomons was a delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the north island that was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben .
she had come to the south with an older companion , which Kevern thought was her aunt , and inherited a plot in a damp but paradisian valley called Paradise Valley .
no one had lived in the house for several years .
the pipes were leak , in the baths were still spiders , naked necks had left their traces on all windows and believed that all of them belonged to them , and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge coal heads .
it was like the house from a children &apos;s fairy tale , both threatening and enticing , a garden full of secrets .
portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel &quot; J &quot; is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Award 2014 .
the shortlist will be announced next week .
Kevern had sat with Ailinn on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon .
your feet are too big .
due to their own aggressiveness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
not banned - nothing was really banned - simply not played .
it has been successfully obsolete , just as the word obsolete .
the general taste created what decrees and regulations would never have done , and how people choose the Vom @-@ Tellerwäscher @-@ zum @-@ Millionaire @-@ Memoiren , cookbooks and love romance for books , they chose the ballads in music .
in the euphoria of the day Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to have great feet in a grob @-@ comic serenade of Ailinns .
Ailinn did not understand that .
&quot; this was a well @-@ known song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller , &quot; he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips .
this was always done by his father to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth .
it had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had played it with his own father , so he had told .
if you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips , it costs you a penny .
it was not a very funny game at that time , and it was not very funny .
he knew that this was what he expected , that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
Ailinn had never heard them .
jazz was not played , even if it was not directly forbidden .
the staff were very friendly and helpful .
it was only space for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
people wanted to be absolutely sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end .
so is the mind .
his unpredictability made people nervous .
and jazz was musically expressive mind .
although he had become 10 years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior , Kevern knew something about jazz from his father &apos;s half @-@ secret collection of old CDs .
but at least he didn &apos;t have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black .
at their age she probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black .
again , there were no laws or constraints .
a consistent society meant that every element of this society thankfully agreed to the principle of group talent - thankfully as those discarded by fate .
people of Afro @-@ Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temperament and body building , so they sang and ranged .
people who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent , as nature did , with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning phone .
what was left of the Polish community was sewerage ; what was left of the Greeks destroyed Teller .
those from the Gulf States and the Levante , whose grandparents had not left the country quickly than WAS TOTAL WAR , WENN ES WAR - for fear of being charged with fire storms , even fearing that the flames would feed them as the next ones - labyrinth and sharks .
everyone according to their abilities .
as she had only heard ballads , Ailinn found it hard to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just told her could ever be wasted .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; these are not really offensive , &quot; said Kevern .
except for people whose feet are too large .
my father never insulted anyone , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security .
nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbon leaves .
Ailinn still did not understand .
why should your father have loved this ?
he wanted to say that it was a jux , but hesitated to put two fingers on the lips in her presence .
she already thought that he was something strange .
&quot; it seemed funny to him , &quot; he said instead .
she shaken her head unbelievably and blocked Keverns view .
there was nothing more to see around the world than her uncut rabid black hair .
there was nothing he would have liked to see .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; they mean it without conviction .
but that does not explain why you prefer me .
it seemed honest .
are my feet too big ?
he saw again .
your feet are not so direct .
maybe your ankle , a little bit ...
and you say you hate me because my ankle is too thick ?
hate you ?
of course I don &apos;t hate you .
that is just the stupid song .
he could have said &quot; I love you , &quot; but it was too early for that .
&quot; your thick ankle is precisely why you forgot me , &quot; he tried it instead .
I am a bit perverted .
that did not sound right .
it should have been funny .
when he tried to be funny , he often got into trouble because , like his father , he did not have the soothing charm that was needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes .
perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel .
perhaps he wanted to be , Kevern .
despite his kind eyes .
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose out of her deck chair , threw the console and swept the wine they had drunk .
wood flowering wine , so dryness was no excuse for him .
in her excitement she seemed to tremble like palmwedel in storm .
&quot; and your dick head is precisely why I feel perverted to you , &quot; she said ...
except that I am not .
she was sorry for both the unnecessary inconvenience of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she opposed him .
did she think he would beat them ?
she had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here .
the same huge and icy ocean erupted here as there was on the shore .
the same confused men , with even thicker skin and more dignified after THE WAS TOTAL WAR than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beaches , moved from Kneipe to Kneipe , always willing to raise their hand against a woman who refused or lamented them .
Dickkopf ?
they would have shown her a big fist if she did not leave !
they only crawl - Knutschen was the most used word for an erotic appeal between men and women , a counter @-@ gift to the loving love ballads from the console - they only crashed and then beat .
according to Keverns , this was an unnecessary refinement , since the kutter itself was an act of violence .
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign through her body .
he rose out of the deck chair like an old man .
she also felt standing , but the richness of his sorrow surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they hardly knew .
she watched him as he moved away - just like a room on the upper floor , her companion was watching him - a man complained about something he had created himself .
Adam leaves the garden , she thought .
she felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , though some had raised her hands against them .
a man turned away from her , bowed his back , ashamed , defeated , without fighting spirit - why was this a sight that she seemed to know well when she could not remember once before today ?
when she was alone again , Ailinn saw Solomon &apos;s feet .
several years before the recent events , Esme Nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32 @-@ year @-@ old researcher on behalf of Ofnow , the non @-@ legislative monitoring body for public sentiment , was working on a short talk about the continued low and middle @-@ level violence in exactly the parts of the country where it was invested , if not abolished .
&quot; much has already been done , and much still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that has waged thousands of wars and won most of them , especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been felt , despite the rarely elevated caverns .
but some features turn out to be indefinite .
the higher the church tower , it seems , the less the passion it continues to arouse .
while listening to sentimental ballads , the population is deprived of stories about overblown difficulties , claiming to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life , but still not only does the former raw age keep rural communities and our urban fabric firmly in their hands , but there are also evidence of the emergence of new fields of contention .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate , &quot; she said when he read the whole report .
I suggest that you read fewer novels .
ESME Nussbaum reduced her head .
I must also ask : are you atheist ?
&quot; I do not think I have to say that , &quot; said Esme Nussbaum .
are you lesbian ?
once again Esme talked about her right to privacy and refusal to say .
feminist ?
silence again .
&quot; I do not ask this , &quot; said Luther Rabinowitz , &quot; because I would be against atheism , literacy or feminism .
this is a free job .
we serve a society free from prejudice .
but certain types of hypersensitivity , which are acceptable and commendable in themselves , can occasionally distort results as you have presented them .
you yourself seem to have prejudices against the church , and these things , which you call &quot; embarrassing &quot; and &quot; pink , &quot; could be interpreted by others as an expression of natural power and vitality .
if you continue to ride around , WAS HAS IS , WENN IT IS like if it had happened yesterday , it means taking away its essential vitality .
ESME Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke .
behind his head , an LED font in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given to the country over the last quarter @-@ century or more .
smile to your neighbour , appreciate your partner , listen to ballads , visit Musicals , use your phone , speak , explain , listen , agree , apologize .
speaking is better than silence , the healthy word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; I fully understand what you want to do , &quot; Esme Nussbaum replied with a calm voice when she was sure that her predecessor had spoken at the end , &quot; and I say nothing other than that we have not been as effective as we can imagine ourselves .
my concern is that , without warning , we may find ourselves in the process of repeating the mistakes that led to the very first FIGHT AGAINST WAS .
this time , however , it is not the others where we leave our anger and our mistrust .
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands .
to indicate an end patient .
&quot; you go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if you call actions &quot; errors &quot; that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
they also go too far when you say that they have left their &quot; anger &quot; and their &quot; mistrust &quot; to &quot; others . &quot;
in fact , it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are talking about &quot; us &quot; and &quot; others &quot; in terms of understanding the past as well as protecting the present .
there was no &quot; us &quot; and there were no &quot; others . &quot;
it was a time of disorder , that is all we know .
&quot; if we are honest with ourselves , &quot; he dared to throw in , &quot; no part of society can claim to have behaved well .
I am not attacking anyone .
whether it was done badly or well , what happened has happened .
that was then .
nothing more needs to be said about this - we agree on that .
and just as there is no need to be blamed , there must be no guilt if such eradication is appropriate and if there is a way to eradicate it .
but what is the point of the past if we do not learn from it ?
the past serves to forget them .
if I may ,
Luther Rabinowitz brought down his pyramid .
&quot; I will consider her report , &quot; he said and dismissed her .
the next day , when she went to work as usual , she was overtaken by a motorcyclist who , as passers have described , had been driven on the footpath in a kind of &quot; brutal anger . &quot;
there are instances .
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned ; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
officials in Lesotho denied planning a coup d &apos;état to overthrow the government and said that they were going against policemen accused of arming political fanatics .
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country &apos;s army had converted its seat of office and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru .
the Prime Minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting threats of aggression .
military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is no de facto coup , but that the military is responding to the threat posed by &quot; political fanatics , &quot; whose arming was imminent by the police .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho &apos;s defense forces acted after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements within the police actually wanted to arm some of the political , party @-@ political young fanatics who were about to cause devastating damage , &quot; he said to Voice of America .
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a surge .
&quot; although no one has claimed to have torn the government through violence , all reports agree that Lesotho &apos;s defence forces have so far shown signs of a coup d &apos;état , &quot; he said .
spokesmen of the Lesotho military told us on Sunday that the soldiers were going back to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was calm .
meanwhile , Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over governance while Thabanes is absent .
Thabane announced that he believed he had been targeted because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country .
there has been great tension in Lesotho since June , after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the disputes in his unity government .
he said that his actions had not undermined the government , despite different accusations .
euro area output at a 13 @-@ month low
the rise in output in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point of the last 13 months in August , according to a carefully observed study .
the final Markit purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry ( PMI ) fell to 50.7 in August , after 51.8 in July .
an increase of 50 indicates an expansion .
new orders fell and factories experienced collapses in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
the figures arrive before the European Central Bank ( ECB ) meeting on Thursday .
markets expect the Bank to adopt a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery in the eurozone and for the threat of deflation at just 0.3 % inflation .
there is speculation that the head of the ECB , Mario Draghi , could provide further information later this week as to whether he is considering quantitative easing for the eurozone , according to those made by Britain and the US during the financial crisis .
&quot; although small growth is better than no growth , the dampening effects of rising economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers , &quot; said Rob Dobson , leading economist at Markit .
the factory PMI for Germany , Russia &apos;s largest trading partner in the EU , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4 .
meanwhile , in the second largest economy of the block , France , PMI fell to 46.9 .
France remains a sorcerer and Italy &apos;s departure from solid expansion to stagnation .
hints that growth incentives in key industries in Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer effective are not reassuring either , &quot; said Mr Dobson .
the decline in industry is likely to fuel analysts &quot; fire , who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives .
positive news came from the Republic of Ireland , where PMI rose to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
Howard Archer , Chief Economic Expert at IHS Global Insight , said : &quot; the best that one can say for the purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry in the euro area in August is that the sector continues to grow . &quot;
he added : &quot; eurozone producers seem to find life rather difficult at the moment , as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine - are increasing uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - especially , and consumer confidence - and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled , especially large orders .
he said that it would &quot; become more and more likely &quot; that the ECB would eventually have to launch a kind of QE , &quot; though we suspect that this will be limited . &quot;
the Highness Year of the survivors of Beslan : ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school , which still affects the children involved .
ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan in southern Russia .
more than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three @-@ day martyrdom that shocked the world .
we have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of the Greueltat in the classroom .
exactly a decade after the appalling siege of Beslan &apos;s school , which killed 334 people , including 186 children , the heroic survivors warned last night against a new apocalypse in Ukraine .
when fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , that seemed like the worst of evil .
the tragedy united West and East into disrepute , and surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery .
ten years later , we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the atrocities in the classroom .
we found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , even though the memory of these terrorist hell will follow them forever .
your greatest hope ?
that the war that is now afflicting Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end .
the girl photographed in an attempt to climb back into the shattered school sports hall
she was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famous when she tried only in her underwear to climb back into the shattered school sports hall after a mine had exploded .
Aida searched for her mother Larissa , now 40 years old .
both were held dead , but survived .
&quot; a woman told me I should run for my life , but I could not , &quot; Aida said .
my legs were bleak .
I stood up and climbed again to look for my mother .
a soldier brought them into safety .
after a series of operations , she considered herself completely cured , but yesterday said : &quot; three months ago the pain returned .
I am afraid that I have to do something again .
some granate splitter are still in my knees .
their aim is now to become dentist to help people , as doctors helped them .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , &quot; she said .
&quot; that has happened to me , and that cannot be changed .
once a year I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there .
my friends and I try not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
we played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career .
I am thinking of a family later .
she says that the siege will always remain part of it , even though memory becomes somewhat weaker every year .
I am glad that many people around the world remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in Britain and everywhere .
when I see the photo of me online as I climb back to school , I think that many people see it for the first time , understand our disaster and contribute to ensuring that something like this does not happen again .
the boy who fled through the bullet hail believes that his mother is dead
it was his first school day ( Russians go to school at 7 years old ) and survived the three @-@ day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara .
as a seven @-@ year @-@ old , he said , &quot; Mama said to me that if there was an explosion and keep her hand . &quot;
after an explosion , he thought she would die .
she said to him : &quot; run . &quot;
fearful that she could be dead , he flew and saw a weeping infant on the way , seized it with his hand and flew through a bullet .
his father Vladimir , who closed his son out into the arms , said : &quot; Damir told me that his mother had died .
he said : &quot; I could not save them . &quot;
in reality , Tamara was stranded out there and with leg injuries in the hospital , assuming that her son had died .
after her reunification she said : &quot; I wept with joy .
I could not believe it .
he ran in and surrounded me .
Damir was later flown to London ( by the now dissolved News of the World ) to receive the title of a Barnardo &apos;s Children &apos;s Champion from the then Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie .
&quot; this horror follows you every day , but I wish I could stop remembering , &quot; he said yesterday .
but I can say that it will be blurred in my memory .
I still know that I immediately threw away all my toy pistols .
but now I can play computer games with shoots and that is no problem for me .
&quot; I am not afraid to go back to the sports hall , but I don &apos;t think about myself .
I remember these children with whom I played in the courtyard and who did not manage to get out .
we never say that they have been killed or are dead .
we say that they have remained in the sports hall .
I remember very well my trip to London , especially the toy shop , where I was able to choose everything I wanted and the trip in an open car .
but now he is afraid of places like Ukraine , where wars cause the kind of disaster he and his friends have suffered .
this horror follows you every day , but I wish I could stop remembering .
&quot; I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities , &quot; said Damir , who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week .
I would like to help .
I want to go to the police one day and I hope they will take me to the training academy next year .
his mother Tamara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed , can you imagine that ?
I remember the terrible silence after siege , there were simply no children who could call and run around , and this silence lasted for many months .
she is vividly reminiscent of her trip to London with Damir .
the people of London walked when I told our story .
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support .
she was grateful to Cherie Blair and her Foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004 .
I wish I could call Cherie and simply tell her that 10 years have passed , but I still remember her and her husband in London , and how the Damir and me helped .
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch and call them all local Russian restaurants .
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant , Damir shot on her with his water pistole and ran away and played with him .
and that was just one month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us .
she said : &quot; I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years .
in Ukraine , the war is continuing and people die every day , and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed .
these are just children like ours .
I think that for many the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else .
I just know what these people feel , the whole horror .
and I cannot stop feeling that .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and that is so sad .
Damir became big and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not aggressive or angry .
he is not looking for revenge , for example , he is not overwhelmed by the previous atrocities .
I know he does not like to remember this , but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and ignite candles there .
when he was smaller , he suffered - I remember how he sometimes looked at the sofa , turned the face away from us for hours .
not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I also remember how he continued all his weapons and other military toys : Damir is now 17 , larger than I do , good looking , intelligent and healthy .
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again .
when I recovered after the explosion and got on my legs , I looked around and saw the hell around me , with body parts around .
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not survive in this hell .
&quot; I remember that I returned to him , &quot; Damir , run , run away , &quot; but I was so sure that he had not heard me .
but he has heard it and he has gone away .
and so life , unlike many others , continues for us .
Georgiy Ilyin , 17
the boy whose terrible image after siege became the symbol of the abomination of Beslan
Trost : the Beslan survivor Georgiy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004 , right picture of Georgiy today
his bloody face was marked by fear when he ran for his life , while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates .
his image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan &apos;s barbarity .
his mother Fatima , 54 , a doctor , had abandoned him for his first day of school before she rushed to bring her older son Vladimir to university .
&quot; I left the Court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it , and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone , &quot; she remembers .
not entirely alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
only my Georgians managed to survive .
the closer this date is , the harder it is to think about it and talk about it .
there is not a single day on which we do not remember this tragedy .
we do not think it was long ago , I think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from these days follow me forever .
no one will ever forget that , I promise you .
forceful : the image of Georgij ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was eternal as statue ( right ) .
I remember that Georgiy wanted to go to school on that day , saying that he wanted to embrace his teacher .
I knew that he was alive when I saw him on television .
and now there is even this statue of the coming Georgiy in San Marino .
Georgij does not like to see the picture and it is hidden at home in the bookshelves .
I understand that , but I also think people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image .
Georgiy says today : &quot; it is important that something like this can never happen again .
&quot; I doubt that we will ever hear the truth .
people constantly investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth .
and now they are investigating the crash of these Boeing in Ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is becoming a terrible one .
&quot; I cannot understand how this is possible , because when you ask people , nobody wants war , so how is that happening ?
ten years are nothing in such pain .
we need dozens of years to forget it a little .
it has attacked my health and I still feel it .
for about three or four years I had some nightmares because of siege , but then it became better .
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day .
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed .
that is why I always go to the sports hall when 1 September approaches .
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends .
it is difficult for me to go to the sports hall , but I have to do it .
I do not feel a victim , this story is now part of my past .
I will not forget it , but I am not suffering .
my life continues .
I completed the school this year and visited a medical college in Vladikawkaz .
I will be a heart surgeon .
my first election was training in the army .
I wanted to become a soldier , but my health did not allow that .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
Georgiy Faniyev , 20
the boy who survived despite being caught at the foot of a murderous terrorist
one miracle : Georgiy Faniyev was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege , but he managed to survive .
during the siege he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was fixed at the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it really is a miracle that he was not killed .
&quot; we feel as if it had been yesterday , &quot; said Georgij , who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer , but was unable to do so because of his health damage due to siege .
it is still with me , it is nothing I have left behind .
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with dire experiences - I have to say that this is not true .
&quot; in 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that , but I cannot forget it .
and I would like to forget .
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time that I went back to the sports hall .
I lost consciousness .
I will never return there again and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture .
survivors : Georgiy Faniyev today , with a photo of himself in hospital after loading on the laptop
my pain is immense and I wear it every day .
my friends know that I do not like to think about this or talk about it and they never asked me about school .
physically , I am doing well .
I should be careful with my injured knee , but I can run well now .
but because of my health I could not study at the FSB &apos;s secret service academy in Saint Petersburg as I wanted .
I have sent my documents , including medical documents , and they have replied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so I went to the veterinary institute .
I have been there for two years .
he learns the treatment of all animals &quot; from cats to cows . &quot;
he said : &quot; I knew I would never tell my children about my experience .
children should know nothing about this and they should not , of course , suffer it .
his mother Marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain never leaves me .
it is in my soul , worse when the anniversary approaches .
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate .
I know that Georgia will not go .
it must be much tougher for him because he was there and I do not .
I waited for him at home and could not help .
I am so grateful to God that he has been returned to me , and here in Beslan all are drawn .
it remains in us .
Georgiy is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept this when something of this kind of unfair strikes us .
he is a boy , he likes sport , but he cannot participate because of his knees .
it has been operated several times , it can run , but it cannot do sport .
I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50 % , but we can never completely overcome it and forget it .
this terrible experience will always follow us .
many friends and neighbors were killed in siege and this only exacerbates my pain .
I lost many people I knew well and who were expensive .
my son is with me , and this is the greatest gift that God could make to me , but my heart wears around the killed .
I know of families where new children were born , but also of widows who have never married again .
it is difficult to accept that life will continue , even if we do not want it .
I will never forget how my heart sprang in me when I saw him in hospital .
and now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
war is now very close to our country and I almost cannot believe that .
we used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are fighting now ?
people and children are suffering , I am sure that many children have been killed and many are still killed in Ukraine .
if we could only attack and throw out all these rebels - as far as possible .

the baby , which has been worn in safety by a special intervention commando .
saved : Aljona Tskajewa is brought into safety by a Russian special command ( left ) .
it is now ten ( right ) and does not recall the atrocities at all
the world continued its breath in 2004 , when the baby Aljona was taken out of the siege of Beslan in the arms of a Russian policeman .
the terrorists let them go , but in their cruelty kept their 30 @-@ year @-@ old mother , the 10 @-@ year @-@ old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in school sports hall .
Makhar , then three years old , escaped , but Aljona &apos;s mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter .
her father Ruslan has since married again and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana who named Kristina after his lost daughter .
Aljona , now ten years old , does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl , say neighbors .
&quot; they are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children , &quot; says a close friend .
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories of the tenth anniversary .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
if you would like to take photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the cheapest option is a waterproof point @-@ and @-@ shoot , such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition , both for about $ 300 .
I have taken these photos with a family party with several cameras , all available at a price of less than $ 350 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are sealed .
add your camera to the photos or videos you want to take .
some cameras and camcorder have scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for the humid underwater conditions .
and before you jump into it , check the depth of your equipment .
some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models in our purchasing guide .
take multiple shots - because many will not fold .
point @-@ and @-@ Shoot cameras have an LCD to compose images , Action @-@ Cams usually do not .
even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to see this under water , and the right image setting is a matter of luck .
so take many pictures .
if your camera has a series mode that takes a series of pictures with slightly changed exposure settings , use it .
stay close to the surface .
the light becomes dramatically worse , the further you move from the surface .
if possible , you will stay close to the surface if you take pictures in a pool , lake or sea .
this allows you to add more color to your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects .
this is also a good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of poor light conditions .
it is particularly important to work with an action cam : these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens , which means that you have to get closer to your objects if they are to complete the entire image frame .
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed things , even in a gigantic organization like the NHS .
as an expert anaesthesia , he devoted his career to saving patients from both the disease &apos;s agony and the pain of treatment .
among his patients , his wife recalls , was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture .
Lawson knew that doctors are important for diagnoses and diseases , while the treated are mostly concerned with something quite different : pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose path of suffering began .
he wrote in May of this year .
I had difficulty getting up .
as he struggled with flu @-@ like symptoms , he noticed that he impatiently accused his wife Juliet .
&quot; I prefer everything immediately than later , &quot; he said .
when Juliet was on a business trip for a week , Lawson felt quite unusual and uneasy .
something was in the air .
he asked a colleague to carry out an X @-@ ray examination of his breast .
only two weeks ago he was skiing in the French Alps .
the results of the X @-@ ray investigation were available .
he suffered from Mesotheliom , an incurable cancer that attacks the breast skin , that is to say the lungs .
as with most cancers , the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine .
for example , while some smokers suffer from lung cancer , not all lung cancer patients were previously smokers .
but Mesotheliom is different .
in almost all cases , the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre building material , which was once considered a &quot; miracle material , &quot; but has now been recognized as deadly .
for most of us , Mesotheliom is a disease that can easily be ignored .
asbestos is a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960 &quot; s , when industry voluntarily undertook to stop using it .
even where it was still used , only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers , construction workers , carpentry workers and shipyard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazardous material from another time , it seems to be hardly worrying today .
but this complacency is inappropriate .
Britain , it seems , is now experiencing the climax of a Mesoltheliom epidemic .
there are more deaths from Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease as in road accidents .
annual figures for measuring cancer cases since 1980 and likely future deaths in the UK
the reason why we are now experiencing the deadly effects , even though asbestos has been illegal for years ( in 1999 all types of asbestos were banned ) is that a mesothelioma only develops after decades .
and the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not confined to former construction workers .
asbestos was , and is often still present in the houses in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we buy .
so Mesotheliom knows no class barriers , financial limits , professions , or age .
the privileged bastions , from the elegant department stores in London to private schools , are not a protected area .
Parliament &apos;s buildings are contaminated by asbestos .
even in hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy , this deadly carcinogens has already been identified as the starting point .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
he was not a plumber either .
he did indeed find it hard to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos .
then he found it out .
&quot; it looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy &apos;s Hospital , where I spent six years training . &quot; he wrote .
all - students , nurses , doctors and nurses - use the tunnels .
one wonders how many of my colleagues will suffer from the same disease ?
unfortunately , he was able to answer this question in part at least .
&quot; of the four doctors trained at Guy &apos;s Hospital and who have been sick of Mesotheliom in the last five years , &quot; he wrote in a letter in 2010 , &quot; I am the last to live . &quot;
how many of us will suffer ?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed at the age of 48 .
when he died on 17 February this year , he was 55 .
this was an unusually long survival period .
fifty per cent of all Mesothelian patients die within 8 months of diagnosis .
the disease is always fatal .
so we can only repeat Lawson &apos;s question : &quot; how many of us will be sick ? &quot;
the UK &apos;s leading expert on Mesotheliom , Professor Julian Peto , assumes that , between 1870 and 2050 , when the asbestos vaccination in the UK is expected to come to an end , a total of 90,000 of the disease will have been lost .
most of them currently have no idea that they will die .

a brief look at the files of the courts , which the parties concerned often turn to for damages claims , shows how widespread the scourge of the Mesothelian is .
in June this year , Marks &amp; Spencer , for example , admitted that Janice Allen had accidentally suspended asbestos .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 , and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store at Oxford Street .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her business at M &amp; S .
now she has two children in the twenties .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; she says , &quot; I had never heard of Mesotheliom before , I didn &apos;t even know anything about asbestos .
I would never have thought that would affect me .
there are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
the fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance , but to a group of six minerals .
the name derives from the word &quot; asemic form , &quot; a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in construction .
Chrysotil , also known as white asbestos , is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings .
it was used for roofs , floor panels , pipe isolations , pit insulation , even for brake coverings in cars .
it is less deadly than other forms of asbestos , but it is still regarded by the EU and the WHO as a &quot; major health risk &quot; with possible death .
however , the brown asbestos ( Amosit ) and blue asbestos ( Krokydolith ) are more dangerous .
Britain was once the world &apos;s largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that &quot; there is clear , but indirect , evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high rate of measurement . &quot;
a Marks &amp; Spencer employee was exposed to Alamy at the flagship store in Oxford Street , London .
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical witness , but Julian Peto &apos;s work suggests that her story is by no means unusual .
he has presented a study of those affected , which shows that &quot; a significant proportion of the measuring elioma was caused by work or probably by asbestos contact in the environment without a known suspension . &quot;
most of these contacts are based on the &quot; normal use and ageing &quot; of our buildings .
it seems that no one can assume that they are safe .
a report by Goddard Consulting , which examined the palace of Westminster , shows how people could have been unwittingly exposed to the substance in the heart of the government .
in 2009 , Goddard reported that service stores and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos behind Parliament &apos;s committee rooms , whose deadly fibres could be blown up by something as harmless as &quot; strong air movements . &quot;
members of parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests , but here it seems that the opposite is true .
while the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a &quot; clean health certificate , &quot; it is now undeniable that £ 1 billion of work has to be spent over several years in order to renovate Parliament , modernize the electrical installations and remove asbestos , and that after the general elections in 2015 , MEPs will be more likely to meet .
the Goddard report also pointed out that &quot; the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions . &quot;
no one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
all we can do now is wait .
a person who has never been able to determine the contact with Asbestos is Graham Abbott , a general practitioner .
like Andrew Lawson , 50 @-@ year @-@ old Abbott suspect that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals .
&quot; I worked in a hospital where asbestos actions were taken positively , &quot; he says , &quot; but I cannot prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to remember all the places you have worked on and the data .
what he reminds us of is the day at the beginning of December 2009 when he got a kind of fever .
he was 45 , and just late in the evening carried out an operation .
suddenly I had Schüttelfrost .
suddenly .
I felt terrible .
I thought I could not make the trip home any more .
as a doctor Abbott knew that the pain was caused by the breast skin , the skin around his lungs .
but like Janice Allen , he had no reason to suspect a Mesotheliom .
he did not go to work for a month .
amazed doctors took X @-@ ray shots of his chest and started Pleurakathether to extract liquid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory .
his complaints , however , remained undiagnosed .
his health slowly improved and he returned to his job .
from time to time , however , the symptoms returned , often after sporting activity and intense breathing .
in 2011 , a patient came out with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with Mesotheliom .
but again Abbott did not associate this with his own case .
after all , his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
the connection in the case was clear .
in September 2011 , Abbott &apos;s condition deteriorated and his physician brought his CT scans and X @-@ rays to an expert group .
in December 2011 , exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time , a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rip and breast skin .
I am an optimist .
I usually just go on , &quot; he says .
frankly , I did not worry so much .
but Rachel , my wife , was worried .
the result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year : &quot; I was told that it was Mesotheliom . &quot;
Graham Abbott : diagnostic Mesotheliom
suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses , one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer .
only now did he see the scale of the epidemic .
&quot; it turned out that asbestos was very widespread , especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated from asbestos , &quot; he says .
the people exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick .
and so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions .
the most dangerous pipes with asemic insulation in hospitals were under the earth , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
but many people who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels ( like Andrew Lawson ) or in underground canteens ( as Graham Abbott often did ) were most likely in contact with toxic substances .
it turns out that over several decades after the war , hospitals may have been life @-@ saving for patients , but they are life @-@ threatening for the physicians .
it is still being removed today .
students turned their bunch burners on asbestos mats .
and it is not just about hospitals .
asbestos was often used in offices , shops , libraries and city halls because of its fabulous isolation and flame retardant properties .
schools .
indeed , many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
throughout the country , in thousands of chemical dogs , students have switched their bunker burners to asbestos mats .
the issue of asbestos in schools is frequently raised on websites .
and meanwhile , innocent items in our houses , such as floor panels or drawers , have by default included asbestos .
&quot; it is an industrial gift that is included in much of our real estate , &quot; says Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial of Guy &apos;s Hospital .
in one case , the only contact that struck an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shoe in the 1970s .
so take care of how to tear off your garden shoes .
the effects of diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
&quot; it takes a while to process it , &quot; says Graham Abbott .
I went back to work and tried to continue , but I noticed that I could not concentrate on what I did .
I was in practice for two weeks .
then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself .
well , I will not see another Christmas party .
with the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient .
like countless patients before him , he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with .
&quot; it was very difficult to include everything , &quot; he says .
&quot; I asked my doctor &quot; how long did I have ? &quot;
and I was given about 12 months .
I remember that I thought , &quot; well , I will not see another Christmas .
that was then . &quot;
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our life @-@ keeping mechanism - breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer .
most cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact .
asbestos consists of smallest fibres .
when asbestos is blown up and the fibres are inhaled , they can be fixed in the breast skin , the skin around the lungs .
asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin and can cause cell mutations .
&quot; the problem arises with infiltrated needle @-@ shaped asbestos fibres , &quot; says Professor Tom Treasure , a cardiovascular doctor who moved to Guy &apos;s Hospital in 2001 .
it is precisely the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspect has exposed him to asbestos that is now ironically a leading centre in the treatment of Mesotheliom .
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital .
as soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue , Treasure says , &quot; they are pushed from breathing to the edge where the skin is .
from the very beginning it is invasive .
the usual options for other cancers do not work well with Mesotheliom .
for example , the effectiveness of an operation is highly controversial .
some say it is worth trying .
Treasure denies this .
&quot; you cannot cut the breast skin out , &quot; he says .
they don &apos;t come around with the knife .
in the meantime , cancer &quot; does not speak very well about chemotherapy , &quot; which shows &quot; effect , &quot; but does not cure .
&quot; sometimes there are long @-@ term survivors , &quot; says Treasure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis .
two and a half years after his own diagnosis , Graham Abbott is still struggling .
after contacting Mesotheliom , Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson , who , four years after his diagnosis , had become a one @-@ man support and advisory office for people affected .
&quot; hello , Cancer Center , &quot; he happily presented himself at calls .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says Abbott .
he had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
originally , Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles , which would last four months and would likely extend his life by only one month .
&quot; I was desperate , &quot; he says .
I wanted to give up .
but Lawson managed to &quot; make things appear in a somewhat more positive light . &quot;
after consulting several doctors , Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang @-@ Lazdunski , cardio @-@ thorax specialist at Guy &apos;s .
&quot; we had an advantage by not having to be referred back , I simply called and got an appointment , &quot; Graham admitted .
a normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for authorisation of treatment .
money is crucial for Mesotheliom sufferers to see the best available therapies .
but when these treatments inevitably fail , many people are concerned by another financial concern - the future of the families they leave .
and so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP .
&quot; it has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health , &quot; says Morgan .
but what changed in the 1960 &quot; s was that it was recognized that a very low burden was also a health risk .
and here the negligence of companies began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy &apos;s Hospital eventually contributed their case , but it was not what Morgan calls &quot; full compensation , &quot; because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his Mesotheliom was due to asbestos contact at Guy &apos;s .
however , after the investigation into his death , a Guy &apos;s spokesman confirmed that &quot; asbestos fibres were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s . &quot;
that was too late for Andrew Lawson .
how to remove asbestos
indeed , for Mesotheliom sufferers who seek compensation , it is a huge problem to assign fatal asbestos contact to a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who oppose claims know that the time is for them , but certainly not with the applicants .
in response to this , there were clear new legislation this year , making it easier for Mesotheliom stakeholders to claim compensation , even if their former employers are no longer found .
the law has established a £ 350 million fund supported by the insurance industry for all those diagnosed after July 2012 , but cannot sue anyone .
in these cases , the plaintiffs receive 80 % of what a court could have given them in a normal compensation process - about £ 120,000 .
some 300 successful applications are expected each year .
like so many Mesotheliom stakeholders , Andrew Morgan thinks that £ 350 million was a &quot; very good job &quot; for the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insurers for insurers , &quot; he says , and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if time had not gone by and Mesotheliom sufferers could find companies and sue them normally .
Mike Penning , then Minister of Labour and Pensioners , also admitted that the law was &quot; not perfect . &quot;
but both Penning and Morgan admitted that rapid action is needed every day , with seven deaths .
&quot; people suffer so much and need help today , &quot; said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December last year .
at this time Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang @-@ Lazdunski for 19 months .
after her first consultations , Lang @-@ Lazdunski recommended an operation that he expected a positive effect , unlike Tom Treasure .
this was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three @-@ way therapy that allows Lang @-@ Lazdunski to present a survival rate of up to 40 % over five years .
Abbott felt strengthened .
&quot; this is , of course , the most important thing , &quot; says Abbott .
this is always seen in patients .
there is something that lets you continue .
when you give in , you get worse .
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012 .
at the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him .
after @-@ care scans showed no signs of disease .
then I had a scan in March 2014 .
there were several cancer spots around my breast .
I have just been 50 .
this is not life @-@ threatening .
that is life @-@ saving .
again Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles .
now no trace of tumors is visible anymore .
but the process is physically and psychologically very demanding .
you have to think about practical things - about the money , if I am no longer , for example , or my wife , how the boom time is working .
if you receive bad news , you will be negative .
they must look forward .
as father of Ellie , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; this is difficult for parents , &quot; he says .
it is difficult to know what to say and how much .
when I received my first diagnosis , I told my girl that I had a disease with which I would not be old .
they reacted very differently .
Tamsin is very healthy and undisturbed .
she told her friends and we soon received a lot of calls .
Ellie was more restrained .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients must pass through .
but for Mesothelian patients , such talks are not permeated by hope , not by a trail of hope for survival .
the disease ( like Stephen Jay Gould in the end ) provides a grim safety .
as Andrew Morgan says , &quot; Mesotheliom is not life @-@ threatening .

China refuses Hong Kong right to vote , protesters swear retaliation
on Sunday , despite increased calls for democratic reforms , the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election by Hong Kong electorate .
this approach is likely to fuel Hong Kong &apos;s long @-@ awaited protests , while activists set in motion planning and mobilization within a few hours of the announcement .
the Chinese People &apos;s Congress &apos;s decision basically allows Communist leaders to reject all non @-@ compliant candidates .
&quot; this is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , &quot; said legal expert Emily Lau , Chairman of the Democratic Party .
that is not what Beijing promised .
the people of Hong Kong were attracted .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
in his defense of China &apos;s decision , Li Fei , Deputy Secretary General of the Permanent Committee of the National People &apos;s Congress , said that the admission of public nominations to Hong Kong &apos;s government would be too &quot; chaotic . &quot;
since 1997 , when Britain gave back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese , Beijing has promised to have its residents elected to the government &apos;s head office from 2017 .
the Chinese leadership presented Sunday &apos;s decision as a democratic breakthrough , because Hong Kong &apos;s citizens have a direct right to vote , but the decision also shows that China &apos;s leaders are firmly in control of the process through a Beijing @-@ controlled Nomination Committee .
under a new clause , only candidates will be admitted &quot; with love for the country and love for Hong Kong . &quot;
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most popular protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for many years .
behind the pro @-@ democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement , whose organizers threatened to shut off the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine universal right to vote .
on Sunday evening , hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in rain in front of Hong Kong &apos;s government headquarters within hours of the announcement .
during the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civilian disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks .
however , they did not provide any further information to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organisers indicated that &quot; the movement considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort , an action that should only take place when all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice .
we are sorry to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and that the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
the Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing &apos;s announcement for days , and on Sunday strengthened security measures , including police forces and barricades , were taking place in front of the government building .
the unrest is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services .
there is also a growing fear that Hong Kong &apos;s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , will begin to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing .
some criticized the Occupy Central Movement demonstrations as they jeopardize Hong Kong &apos;s business operations - the lifeline .
&quot; the protests they are talking about could cause major economic damage , depending on how many people are involved and how long they last , &quot; said Lazio Ip , a legal expert who has long criticised the movement .
we do not want to fuel fears that Hong Kong will be out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
China &apos;s state @-@ controlled media recently reported on democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers .
this summer , activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral rights , in which 780,000 people participated - more than one @-@ fifth of Hong Kong voters .
in July , tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region .
the tradition of school leaving balls in the United States is now being transferred to universities , where Freshmen offers performances with the private aircraft .
we look forward to responding to this demand and offering the UK &apos;s first luxury travel service to today &apos;s students .
to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the University , the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft , Rolls @-@ Royce Phantom , Aston Marten or McLaren P1 .
Mr Stewart also stated that the service has a security division .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to chase their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country .
together with our new VIF options , we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and luxury this year .
a company spokesman said that there were no new bookings as the service had just been introduced , but added that &quot; students would book the service in the coming weeks . &quot;
the company also announced that , despite the tuition fees of £ 9,000 per year , it expects a market for this offer .
students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression , and with VIF you can do exactly that .
the National Student Union , however , criticised the service as being removed .
Megan Dunn , Vice @-@ President of the NIS for Higher Education , said : &quot; this offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students .
many students who start studying this month face a crisis of living costs , as the available grants , in the form of loans and grants , do not keep up with the sharply rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something like the arrival in the student home .
feminists criticise racial and police behaviour in Ferguson
the unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson , Mo.
the participants raised their hands into the air and sang , &quot; hands high , not shoot , &quot; while waiting for the funeral .
after two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo , because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown , the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists .
according to their experience , white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive law and income inequality .
but , while tensions in the Middle West increased and received attention throughout the country , Perez saw that white women &apos;s responses turned 100 % around the race .
compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August , personal essays with titles such as &quot; thoughts to Ferguson from a white woman &quot; and &quot; feminism is not just about suppressing women &quot; relatively late .
but for Perez , that meant an important change .
&quot; I do not believe that feminism has many people who are talking about white and privileges in such a high @-@ class way , &quot; she said .
people felt urged to express something about what happened .
it is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnical that they must express it .
for English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University , Ferguson brought to light problems faced every day by black American women who are not considered &quot; women &apos;s issues &quot; in the cultural sphere .
&quot; I can publish something fun on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 bikes from anywhere , &quot; Mitchell said .
when I talk about how farmers are under siege in their own country , silence is depressing .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about public security ? &quot; she asked .
for black women like Mitchell , who have studied race , gender , and sexuality in US history , there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems .
for them , black women have not had the luxury of cleaning up the issues ; they live every day in the combined reality .
while white women now combine race and gender in feminist mainstream circles , Angela Hattery , professor of women and gender research at George Mason University , says that their predecessors did the opposite .
&quot; between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were sampled and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , &quot; Hattery said .
white women had to be involved in history to justify Lynch &apos;s murder .
for Hattery , the split between white and black women came at the point where white clamps for women &apos;s voting rights , such as Susan B. Anthony , analyzed the country in the late nineteenth century and found that the struggle for electoral rights could only be successful for one group : women or black .
&quot; they took the decision to defend women &apos;s electoral rights , and the right to vote for black should come later , &quot; Hattery said .
if you remember such things , you will know with power why coloured women do not trust white women .
we did not do our job well .
we have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons .
even after women were given the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade for white women to organize themselves against Lynch in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching .
the group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says Mitchell .
for Mitchell , the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior , racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played &quot; catch &quot; with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations .
&quot; would it not be great for the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms to have the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception ? &quot;
second generation feminists who built up their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means are now trying to understand what that means .
the well @-@ known white feminist activist Gloria Steiner went two weeks after Michael Brown &apos;s shooting on Facebook and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll , Guardian &apos;s columnist calling for more protests from white Americans on racism .
&quot; I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about the race , which are clearly different in public polls - will lead the changes , &quot;
although Steiner stands for more intersectional feminism , which addresses racial and gender issues , some of her comments on racial issues in America are puzzled .
Christina Sommers , researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of &quot; Who stole Feminism ? &quot; said to She The People that young men in the United States , especially young coloured men , are &quot; far more vulnerable than their sisters , &quot; but Steinem &apos;s remarks about Ferguson are contrary to their earlier criticisms .
there are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
but when the White House recently set up a small program , My Brother &apos;s Keeper , to help vulnerable young black and hispanic men , there were annoying reactions from many feminists , including Gloria Steiner .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that comes to the fore of mainstream feminism .
after the US border police picked up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country &apos;s south @-@ west border this year , the issue of immigration reform is returning to the surface - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
Andrea Mercado , Co @-@ Chair of We Belong Together , an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform , said that for the issue to be considered as an essential women &apos;s issue , she only had to publish the stories of immigrant women .
&quot; these speak for themselves , &quot; Mercado said .
when the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants , the women they accompany are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; these stories are reflected in women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; pigs House &quot; in Ipswich is for sale
the image of a property for sale was removed from real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that made it comfortable in the living room .
the detached house has one bedroom , located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £ 120,000 .
one of the details was a picture of the house &apos;s living room - including a pig that had placed his head on a sofa .
real estate agent Connells said that the pig on the photo is the pet of the owner .
&quot; the photo was erroneously published and has now been removed , &quot; said a spokesperson of the company .
Connells described the former meeting house as a &quot; unique one @-@ family house with one bedroom . &quot;
although the broker has removed the image from the website , it still appears on promotional material .
home sales were of interest to the social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price .
Harvey is home to a new millionaire after lottery
a Lottoplayer from Harvey this month
the search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues , with a happy winner receiving almost $ 1.1 million from the lottery education on Saturday .
a newspaper kiosk in Harvey drew for the second time in five years the jackpot in the drawing of the first division , after $ 1 million in November 2009 .
however , the lucky winner still has to register .
the store owner Steve Forward said that the profit for talking material in the small town in the southwest of Perth .
the city speaks of nothing else , and everyone is quite excited .
we thought that such a gain could occur .
eight WA winners celebrated last month winnings in the first division , a reward for a few happy weeks for players in the state .
last week , a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August , after a couple from Belmont had won $ 7.5 million .
the winning couple had played for twenty years and said that winning allows them to travel around the world and buy a new house .
the millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in WA this year , with a total of almost $ 85 million .
Leonidas asked the Gladiatorenarena
it was not only the gladiators who stood in the matsch at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the leisure park .
however , the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday , who were wary of the rainfall and the herbal cold and were completely fascinated by the historical spectacle .
there was a colourful range of presentations , performances , games , exhibitions and information about the Roman era and its importance to the Rhineland .
the main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Martian Battleground of the &quot; Amor Mortis &quot; Gladiator School , which used every rainy season to demonstrate its robust martial arts in the arena with soft sand .
Gladiator &apos;s owner &quot; Leonidas &quot; proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent his men into the ring to fight heroic two in various gladiatorial attacks .
at first , the &quot; provocators &quot; were on the row with rectangular shield and short sword , as well as leg rail on the left and arm .
the &quot; Essedarii &quot; with chest shield , sword and sausage as well as iron gladiator helmet , leg and arm protection followed .
the performance of the &quot; RETIARIUS , &quot; which took place against the &quot; SECUTOR &quot; with sausage net , triangular and dagger , was particularly impressive .
the swords clashed metallically with each other , the shields shattered and the sausages flew throughout the arena that could become a fear and bange to the health of the gladiators .
but the imposing &quot; Summa Rudis , &quot; the muscular referee , had always a close eye on them .
&quot; we wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era a reality , &quot; said Lorenz Euskirchen , Chairman of the &quot; Friends of the Roman Canal , &quot; the intention behind the spectacle .
after two years of preparation , the leisure park became an &quot; Oppidum Romanum , &quot; a Roman city , as Vizebürgermeister Claus Wehage said in his greeting .
after all , the Romans have not only brought war and conquest to our region , but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today .
remains of this were also to be seen during the Roman Day , such as &quot; Aquädukt @-@ Marmor &quot; from the 11 meter high and 1400 metre @-@ long Roman canal bridge , which was once near Lüftelberg .
the Frontinus Society once faced water and energy supplies , and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew : &quot; we are still benefiting from the knowledge of those days . &quot;
this is also confirmed by the diploma surveyor Ralph Heiliger from the &quot; Engineering TeamTwo &quot; from Rheinbach , who presented measuring instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat , Groma or Dioptra .
the Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original Hypocrates , the hot air heater that once warmed the Roman villa .
the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of sound before they were burned .
in 2011 , the Land Monument Office had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord industrial park in Rheinbach .
they found walls of an economic building with a darre for drying grain and painting .
the building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica , an agricultural property , explained by archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser .
a series of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass veil , including a large plate , several fine glass vessels and parts of a small shell .
the villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ , until the arrival of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland , Morscheiser suspected .
the children were also involved in the Roman windmill game , similar to the present @-@ day Mühlespiel , or as Roman students once wrote their names with metal handles on Wachstafeln .
at the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich , the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves , bake glass mosaics at the stand of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach and use a heavy stone wheat mill at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim natural centre to decorate the flour for a bottle brewery or a muesli .
with the original Roman car built by two cold blossoms , visitors passed through the leisure park , passing the impressive state of the Municipal Gymnasium , which presented the results of their &quot; Römer project weeks . &quot;
with a Roman week from 13 to 21 September , the municipality of Wachtberg will also be involved in the Roman year 2014 , which is well @-@ known as the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago .
together with the national and historical associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander @-@ Verein , the Partnerverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem , thematic hikes , a talk , cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes are offered and reminiscent of the Roman past of Wachtberg .
for example , a Roman legionnaire is told about his work on the Wachtberg , about plants being presented as living monuments from the Roman era , and about a witty lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberger &apos;s &quot; Germanic &quot; and the Romans .
the Adendorfer elementary school is dedicated to the topic of the Roman during a project week .
the Roman Week is intended to make the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg visible at first glance .
in the Wachtberger Rathaus , a small presentation will remind you of the fund of the Berumuler Matronenheiligschaft in 1879 .
Ebola : the epidemic is affecting West Africa &apos;s economy
the Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
markets are orphaned - and international companies are at a distance .
the devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to West Africa &apos;s economy .
the harvest rotates in the fields , the mines are left and the markets are washed - the virus has made the region difficult to grow .
some international companies are already at a distance .
&quot; the Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; says the head of the African Development Bank , Donald Kaberuka .
Liberia is hardest hit
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says Alhaji Bamogo , who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberian capital Monrovia .
only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola will be on the market .
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus , with over 600 victims alone .
recently , the health authorities declared that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country .
the virus has also spread in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria .
in total , more than 1500 people have died and thousands more have died .
foreign companies withdraw employees
companies are starting to operate everywhere in resource @-@ rich countries .
foreign companies such as the Arcelor Mittal steel group withdraw their employees and several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions .
local traders and farmers are also reacting : few merchants are still leaving their homes to get supplies .
in some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia , which are quarantine , among other things , the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export are being destroyed in the fields .
farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest .
food is scarce
&quot; people will travel less and less , &quot; says Phillipe De Vreyer , Paris expert on West Africa &apos;s economy .
the man who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables , for example , remains at home .
the population is therefore feeling the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently : food is scarce .
in the markets , stocks of basic foodstuffs such as rice disappear .
at the same time , the region heavily dependent on international companies is threatened with an image - with far @-@ reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international companies will avoid the area for a long time , says Philippe Hugon of French Think Tank Iris .
what is crucial is how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors may have the impression that &quot; it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone , and Liberia and thus to invest , &quot; Hugon warns .
the disease also affects the Member States &apos; strained national budgets
the disease also affects the already tight national budgets of the countries concerned .
the rating agency Moody &apos;s fears that its budgets will be heavily strained by the high spending on the health system and , in addition , by the deteriorating economy .
the African Development Bank has already promised to provide $ 60 million ( € 45 million ) to the health systems of the affected countries .
the impact is already felt in Nigeria , where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed .
although the oil @-@ rich region of southern Nigerdelta has not yet been affected .
but elsewhere , many people remain at home for fear of contagion .
reservations in hotels also go down significantly .
protect your 50th anniversary
the Schützenverein &quot; Tannenwald &quot; Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September .
at the Schützenverein Tannenwald , preparations for the 50 @-@ year @-@ old foundation festival are under way .
on Friday , September 12 , a great entertainment evening with the group &quot; Dorfrocker . &quot;
on Saturday , at 6 p.m. , the big archery shooting will take place .
then there is the &quot; Stoapfalzer Spitzbuam . &quot;
brass band provides music
highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30 am in the parish church and the large fortress at 2.00 pm .
in the afternoon there is also the distribution of the price of the federal and palate .
a particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festive dams with their Dirndln .
the festival chapel is Berngau .
the patronage was taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker .
the original name &quot; Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau &quot; dates back to 1907 , when the association was founded on March 21 for &quot; social entertainment through exercise in the shooting of rooms and small California . &quot;
the NS regime in 1937 led to the dissolution of the association .
only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves again , who , on 30 April , raised the &quot; new &quot; Schützenverein &quot; Tannenwald &quot; Berngau from the baptism .
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a protector through a difficult initial period , focusing on finding a club location and installing shooting .
as early as autumn 1965 , the Schützenverein in the &quot; Leininger &quot; inn started with two teams in the race .
in the following years , the sports clubs , which were now organized in seven teams , established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga .
each year the association records were purged and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier .
just as the efficiency of active protection has increased , the number of members has also improved .
after the &quot; Leininger &quot; association ceased to meet the demands of a modern protective association , the then board , led by Johann Rinn , decided to create a future domicile in the cellars of the new &quot; Landgasthof Härteis . &quot;
after an employment of 2700 hours on 8 May 1988 , Parish Strasser awarded the church blessing for the new protected areas .
one of the great highlights of the association &apos;s history was certainly the 44th Gaushoot , combined with the festive course of the new protective flag in July 1991 .
on 23 and 24 April 1994 the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary .
a Böllergruppe was founded in 1995 .
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent .
a major challenge for the &quot; Böllerer &quot; and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böllertreffen 2005 .
in many hours of volunteer work , the members of the association last year modernized the rooms and sliding facilities in the Berngau Hof , bringing them up to date with the latest technology .
eleven teams in round competitions
you can also see the sporting achievements of the protective association .
in total , eleven teams are currently taking part in the race competitions : six air competition teams , an air pistols team , a sports pistols K1 , a youth team and two AH teams .
the first team with Lars Ellrich , Katharina Ellrich , Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann went up to the District League 1 in the 2013 / 14 round .
the second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier , Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml went from Gauliga Nord to Gauoberliga .
in addition to shooting sports , events such as bowling , carnival and royal ball , club excursion and Christmas tradition are also held .
with them , they are also at the festivals in parish and community .
Tony Stewart suffers from a return to the race track
Tony Stewart &apos;s return to the race track ended half way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway .
Stewart went against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst in round 172 and ended his evening .
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists .
his team leader , Chad Johnston , said that his 14 @-@ member team was disappointed , but is now focusing on the race next weekend in Richmond , Virginia .
said Johnston .
we go to Richmond and hope that we can do better there .
Stewart went into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to repair the right side of his car .
&quot; I have come to a good result today with very good hopes , &quot; Johnston added , &quot; It simply didn &apos;t work . &quot;
not long after the second accident Stewarts car was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed and was ready to leave .
Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car met and killed another driver at an ashes race in the north of New York State .
he decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the pursuit .
he returned to his job , during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20 @-@ year @-@ old Kevin Ward Jr. , who was on the road during a race to confront Stewart .
on Friday , the authorities announced that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks .
no decision has yet been taken as to whether Stewart will face charges .
the three @-@ man champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race .
after a start at the 12th position , Stewart was already in the first 10 and was temporarily in fourth place .
after a reboot in round 122 , Buschs
car no . 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with stewart , both cars driving against the wall .
Stewart continued , but fell to number 21 .
dancefloor
simply try : Laura , Lena , Lisa , Marie , Bettina , Emma and Head Lisa Neitzel ( from the left ) look forward to joining forces .
like many other clubs , the jazz groups in the TV Jahn make the whole day classes at secondary schools .
after the summer holidays some groups have decimated .
now more young people are looking for a sport that is healthy and fun .
in the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel , formerly dancer in jazz and modern dance formation &quot; Spirits , &quot; only nine children remain .
&quot; three in the group of eight to twelve year olds , six in the group of twelve to fifteen year olds , &quot; says the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
with more shares , the whole thing would be much more fun , &quot; you could dance completely different choreography , &quot; she says .
if you are interested in dancing , you can go on Thursdays between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. or on Fridays between 5 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. in the dance room at the former Hotel Meyer , Freistraße 9 , without obligation into the training hour .
&quot; the training starts regularly with a warm @-@ up program , &quot; says the trainer .
after that , various choreography is performed .
jazz dance has the characteristic that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles .
elements from folklore , classical to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance .
of course , the conviviality is not too short .
&quot; we are also going to eat , look at dance films and we &apos;ve stayed in the dance room , &quot; says Lisa Neitzel .
in the group you can make friendships , share a wonderful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development .
if you don &apos;t like jazz dancing , you can also use one of the other offers of TV Jahn .
children and adolescents can always attend lessons in the fields of children &apos;s dance / jazz dancing , Bambini ballet , videoclip dancing and hip @-@ hop in the classroom .
the dance trainer is Francisco Afonso .
adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday .
those who like Discofox , Langsamen Walzer , Viennese Walzer , Rumba , Cha @-@ Cha and Tango can look by and join us .
Bulgarian jail guards protest nationwide
hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria organised a nationwide protest before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia .
in the peaceful demonstration , they repeated their calls for the restoration of their old working conditions , which were recently changed .
higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov .
officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and are calling for a return to the former 24 @-@ hour classes .
despite the meetings between the union of prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice , no agreement was reached , the Bulgarian National Ratio ( BNR ) reported .
negotiations are ongoing , the Director @-@ General for the implementation of sanctions , Rosen Zhelyazkov , informed BNR .
the protest by the prison staff is likely to be supported by members of the Unification of Internal Ministry employees .
Ukrainian army abandoned Luhansk airport
in eastern Ukraine , the pro @-@ Russian fighters are still on the march .
today , Monday , the Ukrainian army abandoned Luhansk &apos;s airport , after severe battles , which allegedly included Russian tank battalions .
the army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours .
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme army leadership , without mentioning details .
prorussian separatists shot off aircraft
in the fight against Ukrainian government forces , prorussian separatists have once again shot off a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters .
some 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donezk region , according to the insurgents on Monday , Russian agencies .
coastal Guard Shipping
the insurgents also claimed that , for the first time in the Asov Sea , two boats from the Ukrainian coast guard were sinking .
the Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were attacked on Sunday near the port town of Mariupol .
seven border guards had been injured , a speaker in Kiev told the station 112.ua.
two crew members considered missing .
local media blamed Russia for the incident .
the separatists also reported that they had brought several villages in Donezk under their control .
diplomatic offensive in Minsk
the Ukraine Contact Group meets today in Minsk , Belarus .
in addition to representatives of Ukraine , Russia and the OSCE , this should include a representative of the separatists from eastern Ukraine .
in the run @-@ up , all actors used their appearances to publicise their demands .
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia as a result of the planned deployment in Eastern Europe following the Ukraine crisis .
NATO Secretary @-@ General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday that NATO is complying with the founding agreement of the NATO @-@ Russia Council of 1997 .
but the NATO leader accused Russia of &quot; a sharp break &quot; of the agreement .
&quot; today we have to face reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner , &quot; Rasmussen said .
Russian documents and opinions show that they regard us as opponents .
stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced the intention to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe .
a &quot; Readiness Action Plan &quot; to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that &quot; we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary , &quot; said Rasmussen in Brussels on Monday .
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
according to official information , Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute .
negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday , said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday .
it is still waiting for a decision by the European Union whether they are also sending a representative to the talks .
because of the gas price dispute , Ukraine has not received fuel from Russia for weeks .
last , EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger mediated between the two sides .
Ukraine warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supplies to Europe .
Europe supplies about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources , much of which flows through Ukraine .
Merkel speaks : tolls will come &quot; very clear &quot;
now the Chancellor is making a clear commitment to this .
but it is not a free letter for all complicated details .
persistent concerns from the CDU against car tolls have increasingly gripped the CSU .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke , after continuing resistance from her CDU , about introducing a car toll .
&quot; to put it bluntly , it is in the coalition treaty , and it will come , &quot; said the party chairman on Monday after meetings of the top CDU committees in Berlin .
for the time being , however , Merkel did not agree on a detailed model .
in the black and red government program , &quot; certain parameters &quot; are called .
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) has made a proposal and is now continuing to work on it . &quot;
however , NRW @-@ CDU insists on its &quot; no &quot; vote to a toll on all roads .
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) is also working constructively on a bill .
in addition to the issue , he also discussed with Dobrindt further ways to activate more private capital for infrastructure investment , including broadband expansion .
&quot; there is nothing special about it . &quot; Schäuble had uncommented on a &quot; mirror &quot; report on Sunday , his house looked at its own concept to reward motorway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election .
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the cabinet .
CDU @-@ Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections .
&quot; the coalition agreement never assumed to justify all roundabout and federal roads , &quot; said North Rhine @-@ Westphalia &apos;s CDU president .
in this respect , it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will be discussing the matter again .
opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU regional associations Baden @-@ Württemberg and Rheinland @-@ Pfalz .
the background to these concerns is that a toll affects local border traffic to neighbouring countries .
Seehofer had asked for coalitions due to the toll criticism from ranks of the CDU .
the left sees the plans as failing in the face of the dispute in the Union .
&quot; the Murks toll is dead , &quot; said Party leader Bernd Riexinger of the &quot; Neue Osnabrüer Zeitung &quot; ( Monday ) .
&quot; with the toll the Minister fails . &quot; Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignetting obligation on all German roads to start in 2016 .
however , domestic car owners may not be burdened by additional charges under the coalition agreement .
they should therefore receive full compensation for tolls via the car tax .
however , under EU law , the model must not discriminate against foreign drivers because of their nationality .
genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
a British woman says she thought as a result of misdiagnosis over many years that she would die .
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after having been diagnosed with another disease .
she actually suffered from Charcot @-@ Marie Tooth disease ( CMT ) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord .
charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnoses are a common problem for people with CMT , because so little is known about this disease .
around 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT , which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness , unsafe movement , and muddled toes .
the disease is incurable and progressive .
when Rodgers was 13 , she believed she was suffering from Friedreich @-@ Ataxie ( FA ) - a disease with very poor chances of survival .
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she would die 18 and before her 30th birthday .
the mother of two children who are 51 years old today said : &quot; as a child I knew I could not do the same as the others .
I always fell and everything took longer with me .
I could never drive with the other children wheelchair or skateboard and was often hired in school because of my way of going and running .
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 she saw her sickness records when her doctor left the room and read that she suffered from FA after several operations to relieve her Achilles and stretch her feet .
&quot; I felt guilty because I was curious , so I told nobody , but I went home , looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Society , &quot; she said .
when I received an answer , I was shocked and terribly panic .
I thought I would be with 18 in the wheelchair and die with 25 , and between them all would slowly lose my skills .
I did all this alone with me and planned my own funeral .
she said , when she became 17 , she became clear that her abilities had not decreased as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor .
he simply stood up and surrounded me and said , &quot; my love , I do not think you have , otherwise you are already in the wheelchair . &quot;
I think you have something much less life @-@ threatening .
after some genetic tests she found CMT .
&quot; when he told me what CMT was , I felt like I was a winner , &quot; she said .
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of this disease .
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former troop training site .
for almost ten years , the former military training centre in Münsingen has not been shot .
yet , every month , deadly ammunition appears at the heart of the Biosphere Area of Swabian Alb .
the grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be blown on the ground .
an ear @-@ stuffed bang echoes in the jumps over the heart of the biosphere area .
in December 2004 , the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen military training site , which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation .
since then , the 6500 hectare area is the core of the Swabian Alb biosphere area , which is open to hikers and cyclists in 13 designated paths .
tax burden on businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
economic recovery means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
government and local tax rulings for companies in the country increased slightly last year , while economic recovery accelerated , according to a newly published study last week , and firms in Washington were no exception .
companies in District , Maryland , and Virginia jointly paid $ 27.6 billion to government and local authorities in 2013 , an increase of 3.8 % compared to 2012 revenues of $ 26.6 billion .
companies &quot; government and local tax burden increased by 4.3 % last year to $ 671 billion , compared to 3.9 % a year earlier , and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining 2009 and 2010 .
government taxes rose by 4.3 % more than local taxes , according to the study carried out by the Service Agency Ernst &amp; Young with the Centre for State Taxation , a tax policy group .
more than half of the district &apos;s tax revenues , 56 % , come from corporate taxes , while 36 % of Maryland &apos;s revenues come from companies .
Virginia generates the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28 % .
much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in corporate real estate assets , researchers say , leading to an increase in real estate taxes of 3.7 % this year after the three consecutive years , with growth rates of less than 1 % .
while much of these profits came from large states such as California , New York , and Texas , the course of events seems to be true for the Washington area .
companies in the District , Maryland , and Virginia jointly paid more than $ 10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 % over a year .
but the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues , as real estate taxes account for just over one @-@ fifth of companies &quot; tax rulings .
companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
&quot; in Maryland , a large part of the real estate , especially in the tax area around D.C. , is owned either by the government or by non @-@ profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; said Douglas Lindholm , Center on State Taxation .
for example , Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other states offer .
the recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
corporate income also appears to be recovering , according to data .
companies in the region reported income taxes on state organizations of $ 2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland included $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the region &apos;s highest amount .
while the trend is in the same direction , the local tax burden on businesses is not increasing evenly in all three places .
the district growth rate was 4.3 % in line with the national average , while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher , 4.9 % .
only Virginia reported below @-@ average tax revenue of 4.1 % .
Virginia has the lowest company income tax in all three areas of office ( all three have fixed corporate tax rates ) .
the corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 % and the district at a relatively high 9.975 % .
a comparable study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia , less government and local corporate taxes are required and that overall there is a better tax climate than in Maryland .
the study did not examine the district .
despite the benefits , Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour .
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates from 6.9 % this year to 6 % , the same rate as Virginia , and the rate will fall to 5 % next year .
if the government continues to meet its income targets next year , this law could reduce the government &apos;s corporate income tax rate to 3 % by 2017 .
meanwhile , small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better , so they pay more government and local taxes , according to the latest study .
corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure for which most small businesses are organized - in the district , Maryland , and Virginia rose by 20 % last year to $ 2.4 billion , a much faster rate of growth than corporate taxes as a whole .
researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year , with a 6.2 % increase in the general tax revenue for government and local governments over the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year .
yet Washington could lag behind if the federal government &apos;s spending cut had an impact on the labor market in the region .
twin city : German beer for Guangzhou
hops and malt - also a popular combination in China .
German beer has an excellent reputation in China .
Frankfurt &apos;s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities .
German beer , brewed in Frankfurt &apos;s partner city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of officials in China .
&quot; we would be very pleased if a German brewery were to settle in our city , &quot; said Vice @-@ Secretary of the South China metropolis , Li Yiwei , when visiting a SPD delegation in his city this week .
over and over again , the Chinese ruling Communist Party &apos;s officials came back to this concern of the Twelve million metropolis during the conversation .
Guangzhou , also known as Canton in Germany , is one of China &apos;s richest cities , warb Li .
so people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer .
Hessen &apos;s SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer @-@ Gümbel , who led the German political delegation , promised the host that he would listen to the project in Germany after a possible partner .
&quot; beer doesn &apos;t need much : good water , grain , and vitality , &quot; he added at lunch with the party &apos;s head in Guangzhou .
this joy of life already radiates Mr Li , he flattened the host .
the official from Guangzhou then approached with Schäfer @-@ Gümbel - but with red wine served for food .
the Chinese brand Tsingtao is based on German brewery art .
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to German purity standards .
more business
a second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou , said Vice Party Chairman Li .
Lufthansa offered the flight earlier , but cancelled it for economic reasons in 2012 .
&quot; it would be worthwhile again , &quot; the local politicians were convinced .
&quot; business between our two cities is growing . &quot;
at the moment , travellers would have to take the route via Changsha in Hunan province .
the administration of Guangdong Province , the capital of Guangzhou , also looks forward to flights .
Chen Yunxian , vice governor of the province , placed this wish at the forefront of his conversation with the Social Democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea , &quot; Schäfer @-@ Gümbel - Chinese Vice @-@ Minister Li Jinjun , an intimate German connoisseur , said .
well @-@ maintained partnership
Guangzhou vice @-@ leader hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting .
Li Yiwei was already on the Main , but not yet in this function .
he came into office only this year after his predecessor was taken out of office for allegations of corruption .
the local leader , Wan Qinglian , also had to go .
the action taken against Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration , which is being vigorously enforced by Head of State Xi Jinping .
the new leader Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career , which is very unusual in the Chinese Communist Party .
prior to taking office in Guangzhou , he served as a top executive in Fujian , where the VW car company built a large plant .
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen town partnerships .
the connection to Guangzhou , which is 9000 kilometres away , is one of those maintained by both sides , such as student exchanges .
last year the 25th anniversary of the German @-@ Chinese connection was celebrated .
with its economic power , the South China metropolis at the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse .
next year , it wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion , according to Li .
the family of Joan Rivers
Joan Rivers has been unconscious of her illness three days ago since she was delivered to a hospital in New York City .
&quot; thank you for your ongoing love and support , &quot; said Melissa Rivers today in a communication .
we are all putting our fingers on .
her mother was sent to Mount Sinai hospital on Thursday after an emergency in a hospital at Upper East Side , Yorkville Endoscopy .
doctors deliberately keep them sealed and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition , which is still described as &quot; serious . &quot;
the reactions came from many quarters , including an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump , Montel Williams , and Kelly Ripa .
green vacuum cleaner and rising wages
more stringent environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners entering the market from today .
in the same way as refrigerators and washing machines , new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September on which the buyer can detect key data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance .
new cars are subject to stricter nitrogen oxide values in the &quot; Euro 6 &quot; pollutant class .
there is also more money for rumours : they receive a nationwide minimum wage of EUR 10.25 .
Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
Amazon just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning : the online retailer - and video producer , and a variety of other things - buys the video streamlining service Twitch for $ 1.04 billion ( $ 970 million ) .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because nobody expected Twitch to take over , but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company .
three months ago , it looked as though the sale of Twitch to Google &apos;s video service was decided for a cool billion , and the cooperation seemed natural .
twitch , founded only three years ago as Justin.tv , was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their Bravo pieces in games , a &quot; YouTube for live games , &quot; so an insider .
the Twitch interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play , &quot; a video genre in which better known ( mostly older ) games give a touch of secrecy theatre , is already very popular on YouTube .
it &apos;s the case that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch , so the message that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken up a bit , a textbook example of a well @-@ established technology company buying up a potential competitor .
it is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not come about , because the company was reported to be willing to pay as much as Amazon .
all we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear , President of Twitch : &quot; we have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community , they share our values and long @-@ term visions and they want to help us get there faster . &quot;
another secret is , frankly , the incredible success of Twitch .
for Snobs like myself , who explain that they prefer to practice sport rather than watch it , it is hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others play instead of taking the control panel in hand .
it is one thing to look over the shoulder of a friend at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , while Resident Evil is shining , and something quite different to watch a spinner watch him shot into the head 20 times in Call of Duty .
all these games could be seen right now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games , so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a good recipe for headache .
I admit that the rapid rounds in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age are playing in record time are entertaining .
but until a game or humor virtuoso is present , his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do skeptics like me know ?
twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks .
and how exactly does Amazon want to make money ?
it &apos;s hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could easily have swallowed .
but Twitch has something every company would like : thousands of young men who are recruited as advertisers .
as the chairman of Twitch , Shear , said Amazon and Twitch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium does not show signs of shrinkage , not even - shame - as a spectator sport .
on the Hüpfburg am Burggartenfest there was something wrong on Sunday evening .
the concept of the organizers agreed .
despite the heavy rainy season on Saturday evening , an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open @-@ air festival in the Burggarten .
at times the entrance had to be stopped .
&quot; this was annoying , &quot; said Ron Sem , one of the organizers .
Salzwedel l light and fun .
from two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula .
the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes from alone anyway .
this became apparent on the early Sunday when the first visitors to the Open Air .
a festival for all generations had promised the organizers .
and they did .
all around the rest of the Burggartenwiese there were saltwater men , but also guests from the nearby and more comfortable surroundings .
they followed the first live performances , walked with the foot in the rhythm , enjoyed cool drinks - in short : relaxation and enjoyment were promised .
and all through the generations .
while some were lying on ceiling on the extra @-@ carved white sand on the beach bar , others were labeled on a quarter of wine in the Vinothek , the young people on the Hüpfburg , which was a great attraction for the smaller guests .
but even at the time of the child &apos;s chest , the volunteers had to do all their hands in the truest sense of the word to get to the throne and to enchant imaginative creations into the small faces .
the larger ones took advantage of the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop organised by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel .
until the big rain came .
shortly before 5.30 p.m. he climbed to the visitors , mainly families looking for the way and dry .
but the attraction of the festival did not stop there .
&quot; there were more people than expected , &quot; said Ron Sem , who spoke of &quot; success on the whole line . &quot;
that is why there is no sign of a repeat of the big party next year .
although work still needs to be done on the content and size of the event , Sem made clear in a first review on Sunday against the popular vote .
he was angry to say that in the meantime the admission had to be stopped .
obviously the security company was booked with too little effort .
the result : some who had already paid did not come to the site .
the response was very good .
in a first cautious estimate , the Salzwedeler co @-@ organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors dressed in the Burggarten .
there were problems with sound technology .
the Salzwedeler Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Band Blocks &apos;n&apos;Rox therefore disliked her appearance .
the technicians were unable to create a reasonably reasonable sound .
the planned Shisha Lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tyre .
&quot; next year they will be there , &quot; said the organizer .
the premiere of the Amula @-@ Open @-@ Air was more than successful from the number of visitors .
and that in bad weather .
however , the organisers have committed a number of errors which will be delayed for the first time but will have to be corrected at the second edition .
on the social network Facebook , the organizers must also criticise .
&quot; sorry , but for 12 euros you just expected more , &quot; says Melanie Meier on the event page .
&quot; you have taken over a bit , &quot; says Ele Zimmermann .
others do not see the initial problems very closely .
I think it is very good that some people are not only torn stupid , but are really trying to put something on their feet .
hello , &quot; Stephanie Jenß writes to the Amula .
now the organisers have a year to put an end to these criticisms .
new Radom in Berkum : Wachtberg &apos;s landmark shrinks
this is not as expected .
instead , the ready @-@ made part is waiting to be used in the prominent building .
the action is in the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the construction of the TIRA space observation radar , the shell , the so @-@ called radar , is completely renewed .
the new radar will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 metres than the old one .
but the size remains world record .
the last step to complete the new envelope is the Kappentausch
the upper part of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane .
then the last quarter of the new envelope will be set up .
if the weather is playing , the action should go on stage early this week .
runner @-@ up to the Ice Bucket Challenge
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain wrote so much when her ice @-@ cold water was cast over her head that she violated the bone structure of her face .
this ice @-@ bucket challenge went awkward .
a woman was sent to the hospital after she had been so fond of the Ice Bucket Challenge that she would return to Kiev .
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain circulated so much as her ice @-@ cold water was cast over her head that she violated her facial structure .
&quot; the water was so cold that I scream , and while I was the act , my jaw remained simple , &quot; she told The Mirror .
ice water is fed over the 20 year old .
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth , but that did not go , the jaw was damaged , and then I understood that something was wrong .
my mother and my sister saw it too and made their laughter almost into the pants , but I had to take them to the emergency .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old from Great Britain was sent to the hospital to get the jaw back after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday .
the clip was linked to an internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter .
are the Burgundy clubs pulling back together soon ?
last but not least , there was a constant interruption between the two Wolfratshauser Burgverein .
now the boards are thinking about possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg , the late Richard Dimbath , former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde , led the project in Guédelon , France .
a year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfriends Wolfratshausen .
positions on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser Burg and possible reconstruction seemed very different .
now the two camps are moving towards each other : talks on a common approach should be held soon .
this is confirmed by Torsten Sjöberg ( Burgverein ) and Herbert Piffl ( Burgfreunde ) , on request of our newspaper .
&quot; I called Mr Piffl and proposed that we could sit down once , &quot; says Sjöberg .
in his view , all members of both clubs could once again pull together .
thus , visible successes have been achieved more quickly .
while the Burgundy friends around the suddenly dead Richard Dimbath had an eye on the reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest , the Burgverein um Sjöberg is at the forefront of the &quot; discovery and experience &quot; of the terrain .
Herbert Piffl , President of the Burgundy , was very pleased to hear the call .
since Dimbath &apos;s death , he has been standing before Burgfriends .
a new chairman is due to be found at a meeting in mid @-@ September .
currently , according to the 74 @-@ year @-@ old , the association counts about 40 members .
&quot; after the death of my friend Richard Dimbath , we first let the association activities rest out of respect . &quot; this &quot; period of thought &quot; was necessary to &quot; consider how to proceed . &quot;
according to Piffl , the new president should then enter into talks with the Burgverein .
until then , the Burgundy friends could also take a current mood picture within their group .
a candidate for the presidency does not yet exist , says Piffl .
&quot; but I am confident that someone will find themselves . &quot; he doesn &apos;t want to stand because he lives in Bad Tölz .
the new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser .
the Tölzer would like to work on the project &quot; but very much like to continue working . &quot;
the different positions on reconstruction are likely to remain in the eyes of Piffl in the near future .
he appreciates Dimbath as a &quot; missionary &quot; who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar , well @-@ advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock .
they are a tourist magnet thanks to the high participation of the population and voluntary workers from all over the world .
Piffl : &quot; I too was sceptical at the beginning .
but over time , I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward . &quot; it is possible to create a &quot; one @-@ stop shop &quot; for the river town .
there is nothing else here .
moreover , Piffl believes that the project could be financed by EU grants , visitor tickets and potential sponsors .
&quot; I personally do not want to throw away the idea of reconstruction simply . &quot;
their goal of documenting history first is &quot; important and good . &quot;
then we could go on .
smart ways to save at university textbooks
since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $ 1,000 per year , the fast @-@ second student Matt Schroeder considered a clever saving idea .
he invented a surrogacy system for higher @-@ semester students &quot; books and offered nominal compensation to delay resale .
&quot; my mathematical book usually costs $ 180 , but I got it for $ 10 for a semester and a Chick @-@ fil @-@ A @-@ Keks , &quot; said Schroeder , 19 who visited Covenant College in Georgia .
the books needed for the last semester would have cost him $ 430 , he said .
he spent $ 120 .
the collars told students that , on average , more than $ 1,200 per year spent on textbooks and study material , but there are different cost containment options for students .
online shops and creative approaches like Schroeders are increasingly the solution for students .
hiring textbooks is becoming more popular , so students can use a book for a semester , often at a much lower price than when buying .
Neebo Inc , which operates more than 250 university bookshops , announced that rent of textbooks had doubled since 2011 .
industry surveys show that about a quarter of the books were leased to college bookshops last spring , said Neebos Vice @-@ President Tevor Meyer .
according to the National Association of College Stores , less than half of all textbooks are bought in Campus bookshops .
here is the one @-@ off for the best deals .
buy online
some new books cost only one third of the price they are entitled to in the Campus bookshop .
the ninth edition of &quot; Calculus &quot; vno Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards , and Robert Hostetler costs almost $ 290 , but can be purchased from the specialist bookmaker Chegg.com for $ 239.99 .
buy used
if you don &apos;t notice the notes of other or normal usage tracks , used books are a good option .
&quot; calculus &quot; is used on Chegg.com for $ 93.49 .
Matt Casaday , 25 , graduate student at Brigham Young University , says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of &quot; Strategic Media Decisions : understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business . &quot;
the book was sold for $ 48 .
academics such as Ingrid Bracey , Head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls , recommended students to ask their professors whether past spending was permissible .
sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant .
in such cases , older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue .
besides Chegg and Amazon , Half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books .
renting
the rental of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well , remember to return them and do not want to keep the books after completing the course .
you can save more than 80 % of the cost of a newly purchased book .
a student could , for example , rent &quot; Calculus &quot; for the duration of a semester for about $ 20 .
find out about the terms and conditions of the business where you rent , including the penalty fees that may apply for the writing of notes , subtitles or utility papers .
if you do not return the book , the fees may even exceed the price of a new book .
e @-@ books
e @-@ books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option .
sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic licence for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com , Chegg and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc. .
at Chegg you can rent &quot; Calculus &quot; for 6 months for about 61 $ .
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers , since many classics can be downloaded free of charge nowadays , while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive .
look around .
Joe Gault , 29 , who will shortly be attending the Pepperdine Law School , recommends the ISBN number for determining the price of books , as you can be sure to find the right textbook .
and before ordering online you should check whether the book is actually available .
he learned this lesson on the hard tour .
he bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price at the College bookshop .
why &quot; Guardians of the Galaxy &quot; did not become a casesman
&quot; the Expendables 3 &quot; by Sylvester Stallone played less than $ 30 million of his $ 90 million budget in the US , while &quot; Sin City : a Dame to Kill For &quot; played only $ 12 million of his budget of $ 70 million .
Cameron Diaz &apos;s film &quot; Sex Tape &quot; played only $ 14.6 million at the opening weekend , while children &apos;s films such as &quot; Dragon &apos;s Light 2 &quot; also disappoint revenue .
an article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in films could be the reason for this .
Collin described 2014 as &quot; the worst year &quot; until now for children &apos;s films and described &quot; Dragons made easy 2 &quot; as a purely &quot; functional &quot; fantasy continuation .
for films for a slightly older target group , however , it seems that the quality of films is not necessarily the problem .
in July , Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and metacritic evaluation for each summer film start shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20 , 2013 and the current year at least 2000 screens .
the results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year &apos;s film hits are equivalent to last year &apos;s .
some commentators believe that development is due to changing vision habits and growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix .
director Jon Favreau , who is currently working on Disney &apos;s upcoming jungle book film , said to Hollywood Reporter : &quot; I think the times are changing . &quot;
we must accept this and not try to follow the past .
in contrast to the current weak cash results of Hollywoodproductions , Netflix has recently generated revenues of $ 1.2 billion in streaming content , almost twice as much as last year , when sales amounted to $ 837 million .
last summer , director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comics films and predicted a &quot; core meltdown &quot; of Hollywood .
in the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a real core .
however , other film industry representatives are more optimistic because of the potential cash fraudsters to be expected in the summer of 2015 , including Avengers : age of Ultron , Minions and Jurassic World :
the producer of X @-@ Men , Simon Kinberg , recently described the decline in cash results as simply &quot; cyclical &quot; and said to Hollywood Reporters : &quot; next summer will be the biggest summer in the cinema , and no one will worry more about business . &quot;
when the 2nd table tennis district class was removed a few years ago to streamline the leagues division , this was a step in the right direction .
now the German Tischtennisbund has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga .
as a result , those who have not risen have gone down .
for example , Göttingen &apos;s top @-@ class team Torpedo avoided the downhill in the Oberliga release , but in the coming season only plays five @-@ tier .
four @-@ legged Torpedos ladies remain in the regional league despite their grandiose march .
the boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League , as well as the boys of the SC Weende .
the SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve are joining the new Verbandsliga , while the Landesliga no longer represent Göttingen clubs .
for the ladies , TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga , the Torpedo branch in the Landesliga .
what looks like a better district class is now the new district league South .
this is where TSV Seulingen , VfB Lödingsen , Torpedo III , Geismar , Einbeck , Hammenstedt , Bovender SV , Langenholtensen , FC Weser and TTC meet .
in the district league there are regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Weende , in the district class of TTC II , red @-@ white , the Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III .
Güntersen , TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the game .
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen will start in the district league .
with nine teams each
the SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league .
also the district league relay of the SCW boys - there &apos;s still starting Torpedo II - is not complete .
in a district class Geismar , Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV go to the season .
in the first season of the newly founded regional association , the two Göttingen districts start with nine teams each .
in the West Season are the Red @-@ White II , Bovender SV III , Laubach II , Torpedo IV and V , MTV Grone , Dransfelder SC II , Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II .
Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen , Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the East @-@ Staffel .
the Ladies &apos; League consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II , Bilshausen , Hemeln , Seulingen II , Tuspo Weende and SG rhume .
this is still better than in the Osterode circle , where there are no more women teams at the circle level .
what is striking is that none of the six 2 @-@ circle classes reaches the target force , here the innovative and close @-@ up chair will have to worry about .
NATO Summit : first protests in Newport and Cardiff
at the weekend there were protests from opponents of the Nato Summit in Newport .
on Saturday , hundreds of people gathered in the centre of Newport for an anti @-@ NATO march .
on Sunday , some 150 people met in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so @-@ called counter @-@ summit .
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments on the weekend and talking to demonstrators from Bridgend to Belgium .
blue Mountains teenagers flown
two young bushers were brought into safety with the rope winch after being caught overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl and the 19 @-@ year @-@ old man broke on their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govett Leap in Blackheath .
worried relatives called the police at about 20 o &apos;clock when the two had not returned home .
a conspiracy of local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found around 23 : 00 near the Bridal Veil waterfalls .
the girl had wounded at her knees and the man had fallen and raised his head .
rescue forces remained with the couple overnight and they were flown out on Monday morning .
they were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable state with an ambulance .
anti @-@ government protests in Pakistan escalate
some 1000 demonstrators were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers , said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid .
after about half an hour the transmitter recorded the broadcast again .
PTV Director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editor .
dead or injured have not been reported .
the demonstrators are demanding the resignation of the prime minister , who is accused of electoral fraud .
the police told us that about a kilometre from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif &apos;s residence , there was another clash of some 3000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday .
according to hospital information , a policeman was injured .
at the weekend , at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured when demonstrators tried to enter Sharif &apos;s residence .
they call for the resignation of the Prime Minister .
on Sunday evening , after a meeting in the army headquarters , the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict , &quot; waste without time and without violence . &quot;
the Communication also said : &quot; the army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state . &quot;
escalating violence has aroused concern for intervention by the military , which has already spread more frequently in the past .
the protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri continue since the independence day on 14 August .
Sharif refuses to resign .
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to stand out on Sunday .
&quot; we will not go back without having forced Sharif to resign , &quot; Khan said .
Qadri expressed similar views .
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election last May through fraud .
Qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments .
then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call for new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are deployed to protect the government quarter .
the demonstrators were initially peacefully hiding before Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to enter Sharif &apos;s residence at the weekend .
Hütteldorfer after second season victory on place three of the table .
with the 2 : 0 over Grödig , Rapid has completed a bitter week on Sunday .
&quot; victory is very liberating , &quot; said Trainer Zoran Barisic , whose team had reached a staging point in the European League on Thursday .
&quot; the experience of success was incredibly important , &quot; confirmed Captain Steffen Hofmann , who entered third place with green white .
with the second season victory , Rapid on Siegerstraße Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment of Helsinki and goes into the national game break with a successful experience .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive reaction , &quot; said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel , who set the course for victory with his magnificent leadership volley from the sixteenth @-@ minute sixteenth @-@ minute .
&quot; I thought I hail all the frustration of Thursday and swore it under the bar , &quot; said the 26 @-@ year @-@ old smiling .
when Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesligapartie on November 13 , 2010 , it was still for Ried .
the first championship hit in the Rapid @-@ Dress will therefore remain in special memory .
&quot; for me this is something very special , I &apos;m out of the rapid growth , &quot; said Schrammel .
because of Mario Pavelic &apos;s short @-@ term pool blessings , snapshots from the left to the right of the defensive side and made his case very good .
he has enough experience to be able to carry out this position in a mirror way .
he deserved the gate , he did some assists this year , &quot; praised Barisic .
team shows character Schrammte also supplied the flank to 2 : 0 by Hofmann after about an hour that finally made the decision .
the staff were very friendly and helpful .
&quot; thank God we have had some luck today , &quot; said Schrammel , who referred to the breakup of performance and result in recent weeks : &quot; the results did not vote , but the playful was always good compared to last year . &quot;
Barisic even found that &quot; in many games before it was &quot; better than today &quot; - against &quot; the strongest team that played in this stadium this season . &quot;
the first triad since 26 July has thus proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks : &quot; today my team has shown that it is character . &quot;
no less gratifying for him : &quot; that we have finally returned to zero . &quot;
a lot of work during the period of the country , The fact that several failures have to be lamented with Brian Behrendt , Mario Pavelic , Christopher Dibon , Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger , and Srdjan Grahovac , Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger , make the victory even more valuable .
&quot; we must not forget this , &quot; Barisic , who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players , &quot; who have been very stable recently . &quot;
the period of national play must therefore be used to &quot; lick wounds and add a little more to the body , &quot; said Barisic , who has five U21 selection agents in his ranks .
one of those who is probably particularly interested in the break is Captain Hofmann .
he breaks up for the team , passes through pain .
especially in this difficult phase he showed that he is a very important player for us , &quot; said Barisic .
Hofmann not only gave Rapids the structure , but also obtained the second gate before his modification in the 68th minute .
for the 33 @-@ year @-@ old , who completed his 350 @-@ th Bundesliga game , it was the first hit from the game since 2 November 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the Admira ) .
Hofmann : &quot; may not believe that everything is good now &quot; &quot; We have certainly also been a little lucky , but at some point the happiness must come back to us .
now it was high time , &quot; said Hofmann .
but he called for concentrated work : &quot; you cannot always see it black and white .
we have not played as badly over the last few weeks as has been pointed out .
nor must we believe that everything is good now .
he could not deny the importance of his role for the team .
it is a very young team that I can help very much at the moment .
that is what Hofmann said .
Grödig @-@ Coach Michael Baur had little to accuse himself and his team .
he regretted the quick counterbeat &quot; from the sorcerer &apos;s category , &quot; as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40minute that had been wrongly dismissed by referee colleagues .
the only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not specific enough in some phases of Tor .
we have had too few conclusions .
interior defender Maximilian Karner saw the same thing : &quot; it started equally badly , but then we found it and even made a gate .
by and large , more would have been included .
the Ruh
we showed a mighty tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series &quot; My piece of the Rhöner Glück &quot; last Friday .
several of these trees still exist in the district , the depicted copy is the &quot; Scourge Ruk &quot; above Unterweißenbrunn .
a hollow footpath leads up to the oak , which is 600 years old .
it &apos;s over Koppeln , Basaltsteinhaufen and Basaltsteinmeeren .
a piece below the quarry of Bauersberg , one kilometre north of the road to Weisbach , there is it .
Vital looks like the natural monument , it rises beyond the other trees in the area and reminds us of an American mammoth tree with an amount of more than eight metres .
a small Buddha on a tree grove suggests that this is a spiritual or mystical place .
but , despite intensive research , there were only indications of the name &apos;s future .
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and asked older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what Bewandtnis has with the Scourge .
the result of his investigations remained the rather sober explanation for the name .
thus , until about 80 years ago , the goat &apos;s brains were supposed to have driven their animals from Unterweißerbrunn to the laboriously roasted meadows freed from stones .
at the foot of the tree , the animal breeders exhausted by the ascent are said to have taken off .
in the meantime , the area has regained its importance , because goat herds actually grow again in the meadows .
the area has also been declared the core area of the biosphere reserve , Schneider has further identified .
you should be careful when entering the stone collections , because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place for cross @-@ country skiers .
a hiking path leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree , but it lies a little hidden .
further paths are signposted , descending towards Hochrhön and inviting you to an extensive hike .
where is the watershed ?
however , it is rare to find a watershed in our next task .
the mirroring in the tomb gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historical buildings in the district to which the building counter could fit .
where is our &quot; piece of Rhöner Glück &quot; ?
my Rise
as with previous series of the Main @-@ Post in recent years , there will be prizes again this year if they have the right solution .
if you like photography yourself , you can also participate .
at the email address red.neustadt @ mainpost.de you can send us the solution and also your very personal &quot; piece of the Rhöner Glück &quot; under this keyword .
the most beautiful photos are published .
after weeks of diving , Italy &apos;s prime minister and acting EU president , Matteo Renzi , won the nomination of his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy , replacing Britin Catherine Ashton .
Renzi considers how the government @-@ run La Repubblica newspaper reflects , the appointment of his Mogherini , also considered a favorite in the government team , as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU .
he also expects a boost to his &quot; reform package &quot; in Italy .
last but not least , Renzi hopes to calm down the left @-@ wing party base , which is constantly coming up against him , because Mogherini is assigned - albeit moderately - to it .
the dominant opinion in Rome is that of conservative representatives with President Jean @-@ Claude Juncker and Poland nominated as President of the Council , Donald Tusk .
the EU &apos;s chief diplomat will also represent President Juncker .
the pending approval of the European Parliament is considered certain .
otherwise , President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41st @-@ year politician of the ruling Democratic Party ( PD ) an &quot; important recognition &quot; of Italy &apos;s role in the EU .
la Repubblica spreads optimism that Mogherini , who has been leading party offices for almost two decades , will rise to the &quot; enormous challenges . &quot;
the native Roman is married and has two daughters .
her party career began in 1996 with the doctorate in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra ( Left Democrats ) , which joined the Catholic Center Party of Margherita in 2008 with today &apos;s Social Democratic PD .
in 1999 , Mogherini became Vice @-@ President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth ( European Young Socialists ) for three years .
with the election in 2001 in the Party Council of the Left Democrats , she joined the high party politics , working in the foreign policy department of which she soon became head .
she has held traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy , such as the Middle East , with studies of NATO deployment in Afghanistan , in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops , has maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States .
she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2008 , where she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs .
when Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014 , he met Mogherini as his Foreign Minister .
if the PD again has a better relationship today with the country &apos;s strong peace movement , which contributed to the party &apos;s more than 40 % vote in the EU elections in May , then Federica Mogherini , as it is noted in PD circles , will have a share in it .
the premises in Brussels that the new EU External Relations Officer has too little diplomatic experience , in other words , there is a lack of substance in the PD .
in Brussels , modestly realistic accents of Mogherini are being persecuted to the crisis in Ukraine , particularly by Poland and the Baltic members .
it supports the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom , which is intended to transport Russian gas directly to southern Europe , bypassing Ukraine , which also serves Italy &apos;s energy security .
after Renzi took office as EU president in July , Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit .
photos they showed with Putin at the Shake hands were taken in Brussels with indignation , as well as inviting the Kremlin leader to a Milan economic summit in October .
a total of nine young people started their training at EMZ @-@ Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday .
this includes an Azubi which has already completed another training in the company .
the new employees will be employed in four training occupations : electro @-@ engineers ( three trainees ) , mechatronics ( two ) , tool mechanics ( two ) and process mechanics ( two ) .
all Azubis come from the county of Schwandorf : Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach , Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden , Johannes Beer from Neunburg Vorm Wald , Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach , Daniel sorgenfrez and Sebastian Zahfrener from Pimner .
the new trainees previously visited primary and middle schools and real schools .
from Wednesday to Friday , the trainees of all seasons as well as the instructors will take part in a team training event to Oberammergau , where , among other things , there will be a full day hike and rafting on the Inn .
the company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 worldwide .
the number of trainees spread over all seasons is 27 .
the socialists in France should &quot; keep their mouths in order , &quot; said Francois Hollande &apos;s most important ally .
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show &quot; their love &quot; for the controversial socialist president , whose cabinet reformation has met with disapproval from the vast majority of French .
the President deserves everyone &apos;s respect , he deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
&quot; it is our duty to stay with him , &quot; he said .
as a reassuring gesture , the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not call into question the controversial 35 @-@ hour week in France , despite strong calls for a loosening of the regime by Emmanuel Macrons , the new economic minister .
on Saturday , Mr Hollande urged his fellow socialists to &quot; unite &quot; with the government .
but Christiane Taubira , the Minister for Justice , pushed sand into the barracks in which she appeared at a meeting of dissident socialist members and criticised the Socialist Party for &quot; taking the French faith in their future . &quot;
Marine Le Pen , the far @-@ right leader of the National Front , mocked the Socialist &apos;s ongoing engraving struggles and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months .
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes , but Prince Manuel Valls has no , they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer .
&quot; and the new one will not survive autumn or winter , &quot; said Fräulein Le Pen to supporters .
she repeated her party &apos;s call for the dissolution of Parliament and said she was confident that she would win early elections and be ready for government .
the French ruling party suffered defeat in the local elections in March , and the right @-@ wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May .
according to a poll in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche , 76 % of French think that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival factions before the end of Hollande &apos;s 2017 term .
Pascal Perrineau , a political scientist at Sciences Po University , warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment .
&quot; there is a small window for possibilities , but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing , &quot; he warned .
otherwise , the situation may deteriorate further .
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $ 3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O , the third largest cruise operator in the world , is conducting advanced negotiations for the acquisition of rival Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $ 3 billion .
a deal would give Norwegian Cruise , a company worth $ 6.8 billion , access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy clientele , while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd ( RCL.N ) and Carnival Corp ( CCL.N ) .
an agreement could already be announced this week , said the sources on Sunday and warned that the talks could end without results .
the owner of Prestige Cruises , the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC ( APO.N ) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise .
the sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public .
representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments , while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment .
Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America , the Mediterranean , the Baltic Sea , Central America and the Caribbean .
its revenues amounted to $ 2.57 billion in 2013 , an increase of 13 % compared to 2012 .
Prestige Cruises , also located in Miami , operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent , which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia , Russia , the Mediterranean , North America , Asia , Africa and South America .
it reported revenues for 2013 of $ 1.2 billion , an increase of 6 % compared to the previous year .
the cruise industry is around $ 29 billion overall and is expected to strengthen its middle class in emerging economies like China and India over the next few years .
the companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers .
Prestige Cruises applied to US regulators in January 2014 .
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $ 850 million deal in 2007 .
Norwegian Cruise was formed in 2000 by a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd ( GENT.KL ) , a leisure and casino company controlled by the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay .
Apollo invested $ 1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008 .
Norwegian Cruise entered the stock exchange in January 2013 .
Genting , according to the approval authorities , held 28 % of the shares , Apollo 20 % of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP a share of 8 % of the company .
Carnival , Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together have 82 % of passenger capacity on American cruise ships according to the original application documents for the Prestige Cruises stock exchange .
pro @-@ Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision .
a pekingtreue group turned near the Chinese flag .
on Sunday , the Standing Committee of the National People &apos;s Congress adopted a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for leadership in Hong Kong in 2017 .
all candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nominating committee that is likely to be filled with peking members .
this decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and induced pro @-@ democracy activists to perceive their threat and to paralyse Hong Kong &apos;s financial center with &quot; Occupy Central &quot; protests .
political reform has long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong ; and China &apos;s party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities .
after the publication of a Beijing White Paper , which set out China &apos;s dominance of Hong Kong in June , democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region , where hundreds of thousands of people marched in the city &apos;s business district and organized a sit @-@ in .
Lis survey is organised by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong .
the Vice @-@ Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee , Zhang Rongshun , and the Vice @-@ Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Office of the State Council , Feng Wei , should be consulted during the day .
student activists announced that they would meet in the afternoon before the Hong Kong leadership office .
Britain did not provide any democratic elements until the end of the 150 @-@ year colonial government in Hong Kong .
Putin calls on Kiev to start &quot; state talks &quot; with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin , according to Russian media reports , called on Sunday for the Ukrainian government to stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and to start negotiations directly on the &quot; statehood &quot; of the breakaway region .
his spokesman , Dimitri Peskov , later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia , but that his status with Ukraine should be redefined in order to give the Russian @-@ speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests .
Putin &apos;s call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with pro @-@ Russian insurgents , however , fits in with the strategy that he seems to have pursued since the start of the riots five months ago : helping the separatists to capture territories and pressure the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossija region to become de facto independent of Russia .
in an interview with the state television channel One , Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the territories held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk , which were taken in March and April , after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula on 18 March .
the Kremlin and the separatists have recently described the area as &quot; Novorossija &quot; or &quot; Neurussland , &quot; a term reminiscent of the pre @-@ revolutionary glory of the Russian empire .
Putin pointed out that all those who , as part of Ukrainian politicians &quot; campaigns for the elections on 26 October and , while government groups in the areas held by separatists , are attacking civilian communities for early peace talks &quot; caught in their illusions , &quot; Itar Tass said .
&quot; we need to start detailed talks immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of South @-@ East Ukraine in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
Peskov said that Putin &apos;s reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that Kiev &apos;s leaders have been discussing for months to dispel fears in Russian @-@ speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk .
only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern territories the necessary autonomy , said Peskov .
this is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , Peskov said , &quot; because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but about an internal conflict in Ukraine . &quot;
clarifying the Kremlin &apos;s &quot; misinterpretation &quot; of Putin &apos;s remarks underscored Russia &apos;s leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East , unlike the direct annexation of Crimea , where the majority of the two million inhabitants are ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the Donezk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine , as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians , and pre @-@ conflict surveys provided a broad majority for remaining in Ukraine .
the autonomy raised by Russian diplomats in international fora would give Ukraine &apos;s regional governments power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations , giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that links Russia &apos;s territory with Crimea .
the Black Sea peninsula , annexed five months ago , is the home port for most of the Russian navy , as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region .
the regions between the Rostov area in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines , factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military .
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his speech on the inauguration of office on 7 June that Ukrainian legislation , following new elections , should take into account the addition to the Constitution to give the respective territories greater control over their finances and languages .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels , who are accused of arming and inciting Moscow .
Putin &apos;s last call to Kyiv to negotiate with separatist leaders on an equal footing followed a further push by the rebels last week , after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Asov Sea .
the separatists supported by Russia took over the hands of Ukrainian security officials , who , according to fears of Ukrainian security officials , is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea , control of Nowoasowsk .
this is why massive civil and military preparations have begun to secure Mariupol , a steel industry with 500,000 inhabitants , between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to Crimea Peninsula .
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years .
&quot; we are close to a point where there is no return , &quot; said Poroshenko .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukraine &apos;s territory .
the EU summit did not take any concrete action , the leadership called for the draft of further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists , said Colonel Andrij Lysenko , Speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council Reimports in Kiev on Saturday .
on Sunday , the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers arrested by Russian incursion in Ilowajsk were replaced with 10 Russian parachutes captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago .
Nacktfotoscare about Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger about hackers who probably stolen naked images of his comrades Gabi Grecko and a Who is the A @-@ Promis from Hollywood .
the film city is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the Internet in a hacking scandal about Promis .
the responsible hacker probably has 60 nude photos from Lawrence , Star from &quot; The Tribute of Panem &quot; and Superstars , including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne , the singer Rihanna , Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle , as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst .
by Australian actors Teresa Palmer , Emily Browning , Yvonne Strahovski , and Grecko from Melbourne , private photos were allegedly also published due to an icloud gap .
there are 101 promis on the list .
noble , who had lodged with Grecko last month , said to Confidential : &quot; it is reprehensible . &quot;
all private letters and images should remain private .
it is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others .
Grecko , currently in New York , reports that the hack is &quot; shameful &quot; and that those affected felt &quot; injured . &quot;
the hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex @-@ friend Scott Speedman , including two pictures in which she is above without a pool .
Palmer &apos;s films include &quot; love is unbelievable &quot; with Liam Hemsworth .
Palmer , Chuck @-@ Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked images .
one representative of Lawrence said to TMZ : &quot; it is an abominable violation of privacy . &quot;
actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet : &quot; to post hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing other than selling Hehlerware . &quot;
from a purely legal point of view , the propagation of stolen images should not be tolerated .
cyclists , joggers and hikers were present at the 8th wheel on the Great Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the association &quot; Help for Cancer Children . &quot;
the tour , for which one was a torture , was a light exercise for the other .
but everyone agreed on one thing : it was fun .
Thomas Studanski should have slept well last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus was driven to the Feldberg by bicycle yesterday .
for the good purpose .
he can easily put away the little muscle crater , especially since the participation on the 8th wheel on the Great Feldberg in favour of the association &quot; Help for Cancer Children &quot; ( Frankfurt ) also gave him a personal insight .
a great thing .
&quot; I now know that I can - fine ! &quot;
small bags on the road in the Applauskurve ?
Nee , if I had stopped , war &apos;s out ...
like Thomas Studanski , who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler StadtParliament , many of the 718 participants struck mountains yesterday in early tau and came close to exhaustion but happily on the plateau .
on the other hand , it was easier to cross the more than 11 kilometres long stretch between Hohemark and Feldberg .
Norman Dießner , for example .
the Green politician who appears in red out of the Kreistag - red Dress , red bike - made something understatement at the start ( &quot; Any lot of professionals , there &apos;s the goal ! &quot; ) , but then on the mountain turned out to be half a professional and went through 45 minutes without breathing .
he , too , went through the route in a slide , as did Nina Kuhn , press officer of the town of Oberursel , who , together with Frank Grüneisen , had embarked on the way .
for the two triathletes , the &quot; Feldberg Cycling &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; this is about Charity , we are happy to participate - an exit we would have done today anyway , &quot; Kuhn said .
on the way , they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg .
the boy ( 12 ) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to get up again .
the Frankfurt Florian Zierz had jumped into the saddle in the morning at 9 a.m. , &quot; made the Feldberg two times to roll home with fun .
also had fun &quot; Fritt @-@ Toni . &quot;
for the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosks , cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply included .
he had taken 40 minutes with his 6.5 kilo racing bike .
a crazy event .
for this purpose - I am happy to be there , &quot; said Andreas Balzke .
the trained Mainzer says that he is an &quot; ambitious racer . &quot;
he must be , because he was on the road with the &quot; Fixie wheel , &quot; these are racing bikes , but without circuit ...
not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz up to the summit , but also a jogger who left behind a cork with weights .
mountain guard doctor Professor Volker Lischke , who worked with his team , equipped with Allrad @-@ Bully and Quad , for safety , said : &quot; the kenn &quot; I from Frankfurt , who trained for a special skating rail , only that he pulls the sleigh himself . &quot;
the 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - were sent to groups in the morning .
the hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
the first cyclists and runners followed at 10 am .
five minutes later , the first mountain bikers kicked off .
bent Hansen , chairman of the association &quot; Radeln auf den GroßFeldberg , &quot; gave the start commandos and wished the participants a nice excursion .
for next year he hopes that he will succeed in blocking the route to Feldberg to the safety of the participants .
