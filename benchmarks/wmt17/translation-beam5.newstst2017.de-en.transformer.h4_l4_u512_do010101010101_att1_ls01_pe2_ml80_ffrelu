28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
the victim &apos;s brother said that he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm him , &quot; Finally , he went uphill . &quot;
the Leichnam , found on Wednesday morning in Westfield Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Galicia from San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and that the investigation is ongoing .
the brother of the victim , Louis Galicia , told the ABS channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank , who worked as a cook in Boston , had raised his dream job six months ago as a cook in the Sons &amp; Daughters restaurant in San Francisco .
a spokesman for the Sons &amp; Daughters said that they were &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss it painfully , &quot; said the speaker .
our thoughts and condolences are with Franks family and friends at this difficult time .
Louis Galicia indicated that Frank first lived in hostels , but that &quot; things finally went up for him . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; said Louis Garcia KGO .
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a great heart .
his way to connect with his family was to always cook us something , prepare us for dinner , &quot; said Louis Galicia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who swam with the current .
&quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this unveiled diamond that lit brightly every day , &quot; he said .
anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD reference phone at 415 @-@ 575 @-@ 4444 .
Jennifer Aniston : I am always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now made this clear in an interview .
&quot; I am always put in drawers or glued from outside labels , which usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not want to be always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; frankly , these things are rather bad for me . &quot;
Jennifer Aniston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as she says in the current &quot; Cosmopolitan . &quot;
after all , the actress likes to spend her time at home , on the front television with a light dutt and Mexican food , says the magazine .
as far as white glut is concerned , they ask the question of the child &apos;s desire : &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says Hollywood star .
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs from 25 August .
Golfer Langer receives sports pyramid
his experience on the horse is manageable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Langer was looking with some colleagues for a bit of variety with an excursion on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
Chio : &quot; golden pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Langer
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays , they hunted home to the fodder drums in the fast gallop .
a kilometre at this rate , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Langer says .
and then the riding cart ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best golfer of all times - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses .
he was guided with his family over the facility of the ALRV , and he did not even jump to a horse for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid gave the man from Anhausen the Golden Sports Pyramid as part of a small gala .
there is no shortage of awards for the friendly athlete .
Bundesverarbeitskreuz , Silbernes Lorbeerblatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen loved him .
the eighteenth winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first winner Hans GÃ¼nter Winkler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; Langer says , &quot; because it is awarded not only for sporting successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
Langer has been promoting young people for decades .
and so he gave the prize money of EUR 25,000 .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ fold US master saver was admitted to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday .
these include the Leichtathleten Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt , the Turner Eberhard Gienger , the Fechel Cornelia Hanisch , Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt , the Ruderer Peter @-@ Michael Kolbe , Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer , the Judoka Frank Wienka .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustrious society moved to the Springstadion where the Lavazza Prize ran .
Bernhard Langer kept away from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Trump &apos;s Economic Policy Settlement : it &apos;s All about the Money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want that .
however , the two US presidential candidates are divided on tax and energy policy and on a fundamental issue .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical , difference .
the , about the role of the state .
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself would be quite different , Trump claims .
he would greatly reduce regulations , and he would argue for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses .
Clinton , on the other hand , says that the state has certain tasks to perform , that it has disadvantaged opportunities and that it needs money .
that is why taxes on the rich would be increased , she says .
interestingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
they need to be invested , Trump and Clinton say almost exactly the same .
the democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II .
government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies , and are strongly opposed , say , by Republicans &quot; statesmanship wing .
so Trump could have internal party discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policy are clearer .
Trump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and get coal back into the US .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas and the Paris climate agreement will be terminated .
Clinton , on the other hand , explicitly wants to expand renewable energies with her investment program and demands that &quot; a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
but not only in terms of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
TPP , the Trans @-@ Pacific Trade Agreement , do not want to sign either .
at the same time , they do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they simply want to protect American jobs better .
for example , Clinton is calling for them to be paid better .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.25 was a hunger wage .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , he says that he must not be changed .
but the major debate over the coming months is likely to be more about the fiscal policies of the two camps .
on the one hand , there is Trump , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth .
his critics claim that this would only add to the budget deficit .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least to ask the rich to pay more taxes , and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every fleeing woman has experience of sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is almost everyday for women fleeing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumatised .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
everyone has a baby with a maximum age of one year .
one has put her little son in the arm .
he looks with great eyes curious into the room .
his mother sticks on the table .
until she notices that she is observed .
she smiles briefly and kisses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Katrin Bahr .
she is Managing Director of Condrobs , a provider of social assistance in Bavaria , and deals , among other things , with women fleeing .
the four women in the kitchen have fled .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodation facilities for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Condrobs set up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich women &apos;s assistance .
it was recently officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exaggerated to say that every woman who comes here has had experience of sexual violence on her flight , &quot; says Bahr .
&quot; men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically , because they are threatened with torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a source of hope , &quot; she says .
for women , there are other reasons for escaping : &quot; many steal secretly because they see no other way out . &quot;
in their homeland they have experienced sexual violence , forced marriages , honour killings , slavery or forced prostitution .
it is continuing .
this is continuing to escape .
&quot; that smugglers , for example , demand sexual action for a bottle of water is not rare , &quot; says Bahr .
and women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believes that when they arrive in Germany , the end tells Bahr .
here , too , single women in refugee accommodation would often be considered inferior and , at worst , abused .
as a result , about 90 % of women living in accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized , she estimates .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big . &quot;
because they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodation only for them , calls Bahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for accommodating refugees .
some say no to the question of whether they know about a project similar to that in Munich .
in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken , for example , there is no such thing in government accommodation .
even in Schwaben , women who are alone are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokesman of the government .
in Oberbayern , Unter- und Mittelfranken there are floors or own houses for single women and their children .
the exception is Niederbayern , where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be kept separately from men .
in a study published for the committee , it says : &apos; it is very important that men and women are kept separately &apos; .
&quot; if there is a lack of privacy or if men and women are accommodated together , violence against women can occur - continuously . &quot;
in particular , the washing rooms should be separate and easily accessible to women , the study states .
the extent to which women feel this need for protection can be read in the sense that there is in Munich .
&quot; we have had a long waiting list , &quot; says Bahr .
you could easily open a second house .
assistant doctors strike : calls for new industrial action
deputies of assistant doctors have called on their trade union to approve new industrial action in their disputes over a new treaty .
the Junior Doctors Committee ( JDC ) of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) has called for the full advice of the Council to approve more work @-@ fighting measures from the beginning of September .
the JDC said that ministers had failed to respond to concerns about the Treaty .
assistant doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , JDC Chairman Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained &quot; persistent calm &quot; on issues , which led to the Treaty being rejected .
she said : &quot; in view of this , the JDC Board voted to completely reject the proposed new treaty and called for official renegotiations on all your concerns . &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating industrial action , which begins in early September .
the disputes led to the six @-@ fold strike by assists this year , the first total shortfalls in the history of the NHS .
Dr. Johann Malawana , head of the BMA assistant physician , resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of contract recommended by the BMA .
he informed BMA members during the meetings held before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted .
after the vote , Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of outsiders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated St. Petersburg Palace Hall , I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
there was a handshake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile had a shabby effect , and he had little warmth , even for his restrained circumstances .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - five times , according to a report .
I could not count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre @-@ crisis level , but would even improve .
the next day , a newspaper said that Erdogan would have behaved as if nothing had happened .
his enthusiasm seemed to me to suggest the opposite .
but a strong , sustained cooling that Putin sparked showed that Russia &apos;s leader had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks : Turkey &apos;s closure of a Russian fighter gun on the Syrian border .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was cloudy .
Putin shared out , accusing Ankara of falling back on Russia .
the crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend .
rebuilding the veto will be difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , unfettered attack on Ankara .
at one time , it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he vehemently denied this .
but in St.Petersburg , the official message was that it is time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan .
Russia could claim some sort of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a ceasefire are clear .
Erdogan needs , first and foremost , all the friends he can get after he was abducted in a failed coup d &apos;Ã©tat last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has fallen by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be made easier if flights are resumed .
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed .
a report in Vedemosti put it as follows : &apos; tourists there long , tomatoes here long &apos; .
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West , considering its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response .
what is more , the persistent resentment of the snail &apos;s pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship with the West .
the Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray , as an analyst once described , an &quot; alliance of outsiders &quot; : two countries that feel offended and badly treated by the West and are now allied .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still major differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it may be significant that , after almost three hours of initial talks , both presidents declared at the press conference that they had not even drawn up the issue .
Turkey &apos;s president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria .
but , after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot down Russia &apos;s combat jet - it is certainly better for the two leaders to talk to each other at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s Chief Executive Officer , RBS will be reduced to a backoffice role .
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that RBS was linked to the Bank &apos;s global ambitions .
since then , the Bank has distanced itself when it had to be almost collapsed and saved eight years ago .
during this period , trademark strategists &quot; RBS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ user financial brands .
she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
but now it has decided to focus more national brands .
Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initialized .
in England and Wales , all RSB references , decentralised headquarters and stock exchange listing will change to NatWest .
Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the retail business that will become more important - Coutts , Adam &amp; Co , Drummond and Holt &apos;s Military Bank .
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness @-@ shire .
he told BBC Scotland : &quot; the RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , RBS became a global brand .
I say now that we are not pursuing global objectives but local objectives .
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands .
RBS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to become the bank of brands , because how do we focus on making it a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO .
it would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes .
we can re @-@ launch these brands , so I think the time has come .
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th win at Newmarket
Dettori spends Champagner after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000t profit
the Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday .
he put on predilection , trained by John Gosden , a milestone on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Richards , Doug Smith , Lester Piggott , Pat Eddry and Willie Carson .
the three @-@ man winner , Dettori , who won on Ghayar before , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too .
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal Ascot - it is a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am relieved and very modest .
Dettori takes up the rebuke when he wins on predilection
two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ man Sir Anthony McCoy , who won more than 4,300 wins in a record @-@ breaking career .
Lester Piggott , the nine @-@ man Derbysieger had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it is no surprise that he has achieved this milestone , which few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charisma has been a fan of this sport for years .
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already earned 6,000 profits if he were not just a weekend and big tournament jockey !
Frankie has won almost 30 years in GB , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but he is also an incredible jockey .
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
from Flying finishes to Flying Dismounts , Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British Flying Port for two decades .
it was nervous .
a whole series of large @-@ scale tournaments , including his famous &quot; goblins &quot; in Ascot in 1996 , but he also survived an aircraft crash and received a drug ban .
three years ago , he had difficulty at the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month blockade , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to resist his doubts and return to his best form .
and he is far from the end - Dettori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his 50.th year of life .
Russia &apos;s Putin Fights Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff , Sergei Ivanov .
Ivanov was part of Putin &apos;s closest circle of trust for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport .
in a Kremlin opinion , Putin has ordered , without giving reasons , &quot; Ivanov &apos;s dismissal from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
Anton Vaino , who was Ivanov &apos;s deputy since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
Vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
born in 1972 in Tallinn , Estonia , he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations ( MGIMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Kremlin &apos;s website , it is said ( in Russian ) that he was later Chief of the Registry and Chief of Staff .
when he was appointed , he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as Head of State on draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin informed the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this move has mysteriously upset Moscow .
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Putin &apos;s closest confidants and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the KGB .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broadcast on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at their own request .
but , despite the smile for the cameras , few are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is there a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows .
but the official claim - that a man who was once acclaimed as a potential president would want to steer Russian environmental policy at once - met with great skepticism .
in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Kremlin &apos;s website , Ivanov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you , in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to entrust me with this very complicated post - one might almost say - for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivanov took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , a former member of the KGB State Security Service .
in the late 1990 &quot; s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , replacing the KGB , Ivanov was appointed deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most .
it was previously assumed that , after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivanov could become President of Russia , as Putin &apos;s third term would have violated the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another close ally of Putin , Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin became prime minister before becoming president three and a half years later .
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation with the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced its dismissal in a joint opinion .
Gibson , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner , publicly apologized on Thursday before announcing his termination .
the set resulted in artistic differences and a difference of opinion .
I regret the incident , &quot; he said in a communication .
details of how Gibson &apos;s character is written out of the series followed by a team of FBI agents are expected to be published at a later date , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who previously played in Sitcom Dharma &amp; Greg has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart blood in the last 12 years , &quot; said Gibson in a communication published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there by the end , but that will no longer be possible .
I would simply like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and above all the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzle for fish landed in the garden in Banff
a resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff .
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be Sandaale , spun by a fountain .
Mr Bain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two @-@ inch fish .
Queensferry Crossing : bridge now connected to Fife
the Â£ 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected Queensferry Crossings &quot; northern deck to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife .
it is the first of four closures of the &quot; coverings &quot; approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 milling ropes .
the Â£ 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry crossings .
we are all witnesses to an engineering scandal of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used solely for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge bridge is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the entire bridge is in their place and the last section of the deck is now given a concrete shot for the deck in Rosyth , which means that the whole deck is ready to be raised on the bridge .
Michael Martin , Project Leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project .
in this fantastic project , the closure represents future @-@ oriented high and low @-@ rise construction .
following the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North Tower deck , we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or south side .
this was achieved by dragging the northern bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive but very delicate activity .
massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be moved up at an elevation of about 3 % .
delicate because the tolerances on which the team is working were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres .
fortunately , everything went very well .
rescue in Moelfre Bay : three men are lucky enough to be alive
three men are lucky enough to be alive after being thrown by their fishing boat before Anglesey .
the Moelfre RNLI rescue station beat 13 : 20 BST alarm on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on their own .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around in their vicinity and presented us with the worst , &quot; said Moelfre Vince Jones rescue station manager .
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat beyond their reach until we left to water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a boje hanging without a rescue path .
they all came on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
Mr Jones said : &apos; the three men who have been thrown into the water are lucky and still alive .
while the boat engine had an emergency stop , it was unlocked when the boat was chased off from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .

who builds Braunschweig &apos;s cheap apartments ?
the SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be made much more responsible in future .
how do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap homes in the next few years ?
at the next Council meeting , the SPD proposes a &quot; Living Towards &quot; approach .
but controversy is programmed .
first of all , the question is : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
there has been no regulation .
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says : &quot; we are in agreement with the Greens : anyone who wants to build on urban areas will have to designate 20 % of all housing as social housing in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost apartments can also be built in stock .
but the big point of contention in the town hall is , Bratmann said : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors in such areas to build at least 10 % , but as much as 20 % of housing as social housing . &quot;
a new urban housing support programme , which will cost millions and will have to be financed , will provide incentives .
the problem , Bratmann said , &quot; There is no agreement between the political groups at the moment . &quot;
CDU wants to make as few rules as possible for investors .
the left wants even tougher conditions for investors .
despite this , Bratmann said , the situation in the housing market is intensifying .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will create additional tasks for the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled .
but the programme is not complete : the 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway .
but how do we offset the loss of another 1300 low @-@ cost housing , which will expire over the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning spokesperson Nicole Palm said , the city should now buy outgoing bonds .
in addition , consideration should be given to bringing housing back into fixed prices .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved in one fell swoop .
in the West City , deadlines expire at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price fixing for cheap apartments .
but that is what the owners , the housing companies , do not want .
in fact , if the number of social housing in the West City is increased dramatically , you are moving away from the so @-@ called mixing target .
there should be no more concentration of vulnerable people in just a few districts .
the Greens expect there to be movement in the discussion .
group Chairman Holger Herlitschke says : &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU must be on board . &quot;
they concentrated on more buildings for single @-@ family houses .
but what does not mean is that a compromise cannot be found .
PokÃ©mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see the world changing .
many people have complained that teenagers and children no longer go out to play , but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens .
Pokemon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then to video games and most recently to smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer , of course , to the PokÃ©mon Go @-@ Wahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , game cards and other spin @-@ offs were created ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture sank interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
market entry in other countries has been delayed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded .
within days PokÃ©mon Go had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go out with their smartphones and look for pokÃ©mons that are followed with a GPS and can be &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; once they have been found .
a generation that played the game when it was younger joined the ballot and jumped out of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a significant increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person departs every day .
Cardiogram , an app for Apple Watch , which follows 35,000 users , recently informed Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 % .
the company does not know who is playing PokÃ©mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
many public health awareness campaigns that people want to &quot; take 30 minutes , &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; be active every day &quot; came to deaf ears because many public messages on health are boring and come from people who look elastic .
however , the importance of sport cannot be overestimated .
those who regularly drive sport reduce their chances of cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the miracle of PokÃ©mon Go is that it causes people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
so three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friendships in hunting .
as always , there are also Muslim players who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what is to be done ?
there has been a breakthrough .
even if Smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sport , as this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and use will decline over time .
however , due to Pokemon &apos;s success , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with action in the real world , helping many people to be more active , more fit and healthier .

Simone Biles creates gold in women &apos;s tournaments
forget the pressure .
forget the hype .
Simone Biles is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumper .
effortlessly on the bar .
breathtaking on the ground .
the hotel was very clean and comfortable .
and now , finally , Olympic champion .
on Thursday , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymnastics tossed the gap between themselves and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and Final Five team cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina .
the American woman Simone Biles is touring on the Swedish bar during the single women &apos;s multi @-@ campaign event at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi @-@ combat title and , overall , the fifth , while consolidating her reputation for being the best of her generation , or even the best of her generation .
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at this moment .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Biles has dominated her sport over the last three years , won 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Baton said of her that she was &quot; the best gymnastics I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it expected a final test in Brazil , a competition that did not go so much between the picture and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations .
not returning to the Spring family in Texas with a handful of gold would be a disappointment .
the Americans Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the women &apos;s single multi @-@ campaign event at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell ceremony she served as an exclamation mark for the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi .
although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during her long journey to the top , this is not really true .
some of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - are tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
that is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman &apos;s mother during a school flight to the gymnasium where Boorman trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost a multi @-@ fight competition , a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes .
although Mustafina led easily through two turns , the picture was deceptive .
Swebebebebebalken und Bodenturnen - in which Biles holds the World Cup title - lauded .
she rebounded with 15.433 on the Sweet Bar - setting up a 15.933 on the ground .
Raisman gently impoverished her when she expected her final glow - a pure formality - and tears flown on Biles shining red , white and blue elders when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
Raisman &apos;s performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; Oma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her ground practice she threw KusshÃ¤nde to the audience , overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious .
as far as the picture is concerned , the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning :
police : 3 victims shot by car in series murderous situations
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , killed in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix &apos;s first series murderer , while they were in the car and listening to music .
the authorities said : &quot;
the perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the front @-@ passenger side of the car and then flew with another vehicle , is to be read in the report .
the police announced that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a robbery , as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $ 2.900 held by one of the adult victims .
Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard , the police spokesman , said that the shooting led the investigators to see if it was associated with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two injured in nine attacks within four months , mainly in Hispanic residential areas .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard informed KHPO , a subsidiary of CBS , earlier this month .
it is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown nissan from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later .
Liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Maleah died there .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on shooting , aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the threefold murder , assuming that it was the work of the serial murderer .
investigators found cartridges and secured a ball from the seat and ball fragments from the engine room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with microreceptacle : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Picciuto loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but , like the few of his elderly , Edmund Mikrozephalie , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was that I won &apos;t .
I cannot do that .
I did not agree with that .
what is wrong at all -- of course , you have accepted it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I did not know that people are still doing &apos; said Picciuto .
Edmund can run with a salary .
Edmund could not sit or crab until his third year of life , and he still cannot speak .
but it is making slow progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also likes to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the character language Edmund used for &quot; Please sing me a little before &quot; .
&quot; we bring him a sign language , &quot; Picciuto CBS News said .
but it is not a typical character language -- she says , Edmund invented some characters alone .
microcephalia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Edmund and infections with viruses such as measles or Zikavirus during pregnancy .
symptoms and predictions may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zikavirus .
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
she still does not really know .
I have not asked about the forecast for a long time , because I do not expect anyone to tell me .
but Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by Zikavirus .
it will be better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainfall , flooding causes rescue in Louisiana , Mississippi
heavy rainfall and large @-@ scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday .
many rivers in the south @-@ east of Louisiana and the south of Mississippis flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale flooding following extreme rainfall , reported to the National Weather Service .
Louisiana John Bel Edwards , Governor of Louisiana , announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to helping the communities concerned .
Mike Steele , a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sand sacks .
a flood warning system is used for large parts of Louisiana &apos;s south until Saturday .
the weather service indicated that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in southern Alabama , a flood warning system was set up on Friday , while it continued to regulate in the Mobile area .
the Comite River near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs , both located in Louisiana , is likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge .
he also said that an outward @-@ facing flood in Ascension Parish is a danger , because these rivers will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas .
the river Tickfaw , south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00 .
rescue teams still attracted people from river water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi .
Leroy Hansford , his wife and stepson were among those saved on Friday near Gloster .
Hansford , 62 , says that water from Beaver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose sharply overnight .
he said that another bull living near him would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water was flowing and flowing in , &quot; Hansford said .
it reached my waist .
his wife , Hansford , said that in the 48 years she lived there she had never seen such a height of the river .
Hansford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who could swim .
Hansford said that all three would have saved Nothelfer in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster , where they were housed until Friday .
Krautmann said that the flood spread &quot; rapidly , &quot; as severe rainfall continued and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions .
according to Krautmann , an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inch rain .
Krautmann said that since Wednesday , the soil has been considerably depleted by rain .
the authorities indicated that severe rainfall and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the failure to teach in five school districts .
the CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa gave 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacuated into two churches , both of which have now been flooded .
the leader of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets fed by the floods .
in the cities of Amite and Hammond , emergency accommodation was set up to accommodate the evacuated .
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; he said .
in the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa , almost two dozens of roads have been closed due to the flood and sand bags provided for the inhabitants who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
&quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; said Lacy Landrum of the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Mississipp the Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countys said that it continued to regulate on the Gulf coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday , but no reports were made on Friday .
Keith Townson , manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; said Townson , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
Mahaj Brown , 6 , &quot; released by bullets , &quot; survives shooting in Philadelphia
the police tell us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child has been shot up this week .
the grandparents of the boy identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia .
the grandparents indicated that Brown suffered several shooting injuries , including in the lungs , legs , arms and belly , but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital .
&quot; he has made a lot of progress , his small body was shattered by bullets , &quot; said his grandmother Delores Melendez .
I simply cannot believe that .
the state of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he was expected to be raised again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people shot up in Germantown .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and one 32 .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in a critical state ; the other two victims are in a stable state , according to CBS Philadelphia .
the boy was shot on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , in a critical state , reported the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men of the perpetrators could be .
investigators informed CBS Philadelphia that there seems to have been a cross @-@ fire between several guards .
cartridges for storm rifles traced back to various storm rifles crossed the scene .
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the walk , there were sleeves .
so there seem to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; said Anthony Ginaldi , police officer in Philadelphia .
several houses and vehicles have also been hit in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently reporting the monitoring video .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a butcher at her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane .
she is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gabby and Laurie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympic campaign in the Turne , for more than one reason .
first , since 1984 I have been present at every summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly , this team has three gymnastics , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Lauren &quot; Laurie &quot; Hernandez , who inspired many young girls of different skin colours .
the structure of this team , the Aly Raisman , which is JÃ¼din and Madison Kocian , which is a Catholic , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has strengthened the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one female turner was an Afro @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic runner and America .
now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Champion Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez , as they provided unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines .
on Thursday Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi @-@ fight event for women .
team member Aly Raisman won silver .
we see the tip of this sport , but that is not the way to look like classes throughout the country .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; last five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four athletes in the team , and last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer .
however , the reality is that Turnen is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gymnasium clubs , maintained by parents who pay for the training , setup , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , Turner will receive all their training and this is a costly and long @-@ term commitment for families .
Aimee Boorman , trainer of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , trainer of Laurie Hernandez , both have trained their athletes ever since they started with the Turn .
we need to allow the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone , Gabby and Laurie to train more efficiently and easily .
I founded my service foundation of 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable turnouts in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and hispanic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home city ) to offer young people high @-@ quality gyms who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Turnen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health , education and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , which makes thousands of young girls interested in the Turning and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks to Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the wood of the Olympic team gold and thank you for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistants would like to organise further strikes after rejecting Jeremy hunt &apos;s proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials , but 58 % of the 37,000 assistants who voted in an election rejected it .
in July , Hunt revealed plans to force the contract and said that the NHS would be in a &quot; no @-@ man country &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients .
the first assistants will receive a new contract , which will include changes to night and weekend afternoons to improve care at unpleasant times .
Dr Ellen McCourt , Chairman of the BMA Assistant Assistant Committee , said last night in a Communication : &quot; assistenzÃ¤rnten still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will fuel the current evidence crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly . &quot;
progress must be made with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new Treaty , and time is running out .
efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes through talks have met with reluctance from the government to take part and sometimes to frustrate silence .
this was the promise made by Jeremy Hunt only last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must act now , lift the pressure and address the concerns of assists . &quot;
should he not do so , the assistants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work @-@ fighting activities .
the last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nurses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strike chain .
Ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54.000 assistants who will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mortimer , Director General of NHS staff , called on the assistants to end the strike .
Mortimer said : &quot; work @-@ fighting measures do not achieve anything of little but burden already overburdened teams and service providers , and only worry , need and interruption for patients , investors and their families . &quot;
over the last two months , we have spoken to the Assistant doctor &apos;s committee and responded positively to concerns about the guardianship and wound bonding with the Ministry of Health and other ministries .
employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from a vocational training period , training kits , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training leave , and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers , health education , and the German Ministry of Health were in February .
the Â£ 2 per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of cardiovascular patients will benefit from a Â£ 2 @-@ per @-@ day medicine after the authorities have recommended that they receive more people for a longer period of time .
the inflammatory drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or heart attack .
NICE of the NHS has recommended a four @-@ year approach to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
NICE of the NHS has recommended a four @-@ year approach to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year , and one quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls that make up coverings .
when Belag breaks apart , it can cause a blood spine that clogs the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood spine dissolves , it can flow through the blood stream and block the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk .
Ticagrelor , produced by the British company AstraZeneca , which is marketed under the trade name Brilique , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood root islands less likely .
NICE &apos;s draft guide published today recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor , followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years .
Professor Carole Longson , Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences . &quot;
fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that Ticagrelor , combined with Aspirin , is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of political correctness blows up electoral fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report on corruption
a culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being knowingly ignored , as a damning government report today revealed .
former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles interrupts the police , election observers , and town hall buildings to ignore evidence of electoral abuse on account of &quot; oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption madness , said that intimidation of religious @-@ motives voters would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up lock @-@ up outside electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters .
he recommends that voters carry a card to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment , a voter only has to name and address .
the report proposes to put non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger when they vote to prevent someone from voting twice .
Whistleblower should be given more protection , says Sir Eric .
it calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this not only serves to prevent electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud associated with it , &quot; he said .
the report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet &apos;s electoral scandal in East London .
last year , a special election court ruled that the current mayor , Lutfur Rahman , should be dismissed following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices in his office .
the court found that Rahman had &quot; cynically perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and that he had silenced his critics with racist and Islamic accusations .
Rahman is said to have &quot; conducted his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which one person votes as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there is evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed particular alarm at the fraudulent ballot - with older members of the Muslim community pressuring people to vote for a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including the management of identity cards .
his report states : &quot; it was appropriate to exert pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly , especially communities with a Pakistani or bangladiatorial background .
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior because of &quot; politically correct &quot; hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion . &quot;
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including a ban on political activists processing letter voting documents to stop &quot; election killings . &quot;
the report under consideration by Theresa May also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters for your card before the election .
use non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as it has cast its vote to prevent someone from voting twice .
carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible for election .
a three @-@ year limitation on requests for automatic correspondence .
ban political activists from processing full letter elections and envelopes .
give the police the power to set up ballot stations .
a change of law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 .
ban on shooting in polling stations .
requirement that only English may be used in polling stations ( except Wales ) .
intensifying training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the ballot box alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Hamlet case no penalty was shown .
&quot; the electoral court declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy incompetent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said .
for a number of reasons , he was found guilty of being sufficiently guilty , in accordance with the high requirements of the criminal procedure .
he also criticizes the ineffective &quot; check @-@ out checks &quot; of the electoral registers of the town halls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; last year &apos;s Court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a warning signal .
our country , as the mother of parliaments , has a proud legacy , but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities are threatening this good reputation .
crazy after Kates Radler and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio came out this week about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand @-@ Prevot , who has proved to be an impressive double runner of Cambridge &apos;s Duchess .
but this summer &apos;s 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympionikin is far from the only athlete fighting gold , which has its own famous double runner - at least not if you can believe the social media .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flying on our screens , FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympic Games with more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood &apos;s most famous .
the JÃ¤ger and Wolf : team member of the US team in the archery Brady Ellison , left , has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood .
in addition to Kate &apos;s double runner on the cycle track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archery of A @-@ Promi Leonardo DiCaprio might be .
the team member of the US team in the archery Brady Ellison caused an attack on Twitter after images on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star uncanny .
indeed , the archery received the madness in the social media and admitted that he had been hearing from his childhood that he looked like Leo .
&quot; I do not see much resemblance , except for facial comfort , &quot; Brady told Huffington Post .
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I would like to compliment him . &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly focus even more this year : the striking similarity between Britain &apos;s Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian singer Aliya Mustafina , with her large , expressive eyes , is supposed to be able to pass through as a double @-@ edged singer for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gloria Estefan .
and in the swimming pool , South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years .
a walk higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the Inception Actress .
another lasting comparison was made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett , who has similarly heavy eyes and lips .
the Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun @-@ blown skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord , while the American Nathan Adrian was acclaimed by fans to resemble an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes .
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities .
theory put into space : according to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple .
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical . &quot;
indeed , the US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes .
other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh @-@ Jennings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney , as well as the gold medal in Gabby Douglas &apos;s Turn , which has its own beautiful , wide smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .

the commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle squadron .
Macdonald , who had been brought to the CBS commentator team to give more &quot; color , &quot; was told : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited went down like rent , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan , 14 , sweeps the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ruck , allowing Canadians to fill the gap with China .
viewers across Canada responded quickly online after shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweete , &quot; Have the CBC commentator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swimmer &quot; has died like a pig &quot; ? ? ?
the Idiot did not break that they were still on show . &quot;
ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle squadron for women as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard , in which many spoke to him .
Twitter users did not stand back when they heard how unsensitive Byron MacDonald was .
another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote : &quot; WoW , # ByronMacDonald .
you represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists .
shortly afterwards , Scott Russel , who moderated the CBC show , apologized live for the comment of MacDonald and said : &quot; we apologize that the comment about a swimming performance was broadcast . &quot;
it was an unfortunate formulation , we are sorry it happened . &quot;
CBC apologized more than 90 times to the people who responded to the noticed on Twitter .
the commentator Scott Russel had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users complaining about MacDonald &apos;s comments
the network also apologized quickly and issued a message .
we sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been possible to broadcast them .
yesterday night we quickly apologized to our viewers on show and to our followers in the social media .
to clarify one thing , Byrons comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person .
however , they were inappropriate and unhappy , and Byron is very sorry for what he said .
on Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to apologise for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the CBC Olympic Games , he said .
&quot; I have referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person . &quot;
of course , no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Primark outraged at women who are shamelessly trying underwear in the middle of the shop
buyers did not know where to look when a woman left her clothes in the middle of a prix to try underwear .
to exacerbate the situation , she mustered as she looked in it , pulling her back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of underwear in a shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone .
the Primark shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone , where the woman tried the Unterhosen before putting them back into the shelf .
a mother of two children , Jenny Davidson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear , &quot; she moved back and left business without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales area she took a couple of underwear out of the outlay , pulled her own stockings and trousers out and tried them .
&quot; she did not even try to find a rather more discreet place to do it - she was just there , cheerful like Oskar . &quot;
&quot; everyone starred when she pulled out the underwear , which she apparently did not like because she put her back on the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three more underwear before she finally decided that she did not like anything , moved back and left .
&quot; she seemed not to disturb that she watched someone - or think about the person who might buy the underwear she had tried . &quot;
Mrs Davidson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : &apos; how repugnant to think that someone would take subhoses home with another person who had not been washed &apos; .
the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon .
Mrs Davidson added : &quot; as I heard , the staff tried to pull the clothes out of sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of underwear and to find out that another woman had to leave and were not washed . &quot;
a spokesman from Primark said : &quot; Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9 August in our branch in Folkstone . &quot;
all products in question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect against weapons attacks with Krav Maga
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rhon Mizrachi , a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance .
whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the mirror around for your robber .
if you are approaching you from the back , you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and &quot; get out of the shooting line , &quot; says Mizrachi .
then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before beating it with your free elbow .
then hit him with his knees and turn away while the attacker cracks down from pain , throwing the gun out of his hands , throwing him in the face and moving backwards while turning the gun on him .
for attackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shutter line , take the weapon and turn it away so that the attacker cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and turn the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi imagines .
but remember that it is the safest way to hand over your money to a robbery - unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master .
travellers Ian Wright shuffles his tongue in Europe &apos;s dirty places for a guide
a British traveller underwent a serious test of his immune system and sausages &quot; eflex - leaking some of Europe &apos;s most dirty and despicable places .
the moderator and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Suffolk , shot his course on a euro ticket , a yellow belt at Piccadilly Circus , a folding button of a train toilet , and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system .
before emptying each object , he used a Luminometer to show himself and us what he will get involved .
but the experiment filmed under the title &quot; The Lickhiker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength &quot; brought some surprising results to light .
the idea of leaking a pull toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely repellent , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen bag .
during his visit to Europe , Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health .
fortunately , nothing he leaked left more than a bad taste in his mouth .
Mr Wright has become known for testing the resilience of his intestine by passing through the world and doing strange and wonderful things .
from public spaces at railway stations to toilets , the task was definitely to test his immune system .
in the film , he said , &quot; I was already relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he certainly lived up to his reputation .
the only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample sample showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak after its luminosity was more than 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film &quot; The Lickhiker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom .
in the film , he says : &quot; this comes close to the worst I have rocked in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I am not going to lick anything here , because it is quite appalling in this House .
&quot; the Lickhiker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio .
the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus , which contains both mite acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal and immune systems .
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says : &quot; we really wanted to offer something new to consumers .
something fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of probiotics .
we carried out crazy brainstorming that ended up saying &quot; Lass to us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in colorectal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about products , we wanted to put them in a broader context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of colorectal health and how they are linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in colorectal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom HAKALA , who led the film &apos;s direction , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had aroused some of the things I have instructed him to lick , just as the eclectic Russian toilet shown in the film . &quot;
of course , there were things that made it easier to get Ian to eat them and others where it was quite difficult .
I am glad we have taken some of these dirty treats on film . &quot;
in a survey carried out by Valio in 2015 , 84 % of respondents associated with mite acid bacteria , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intestines , and 58 % said that they use at least occasionally products containing added mite acid bacteria .
asocial family destroyed before Delogization social housing in Saltash , Cornwall
an asocial family left their social housing after a delocalization with a loss of Â£ 50,000 for terrorising their neighbors .
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash , Cornwall .
after being forcibly removed from their homes , shocked housing workers found property in an irreparable state .
the walls were bursting holes , wooden diels were burned , rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was screwed to the walls .
the family has been resettled and it is believed that she now lives in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy , who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing , said that she was afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired .
she said : &quot; it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people do not have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , since this property will probably be regarded as not so beautiful part of Cornwall .
the family is notorious and their reputation is also great .
the couple had three sons who in the meantime lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted involved street battles with baseball sleeves , intimidation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive shooting , fighting and flight .
Skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the rental contract , received an order for antisocial behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house that may be demolished , old waste has been found
in the land in which drugs were traded in the past , the wooden diels were burned .
neighbours said that they saw them fighting on the streets and had to be called regularly by the police
Cornwall Housing hired her and her partner this week violently from the property after giving them an extended 11 @-@ week period to withdraw voluntarily .
Delogization was hailed by facilitated neighbors , who said that their lives were made hell .
one said : &quot; they did not care for anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say to the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fitzpatrick , Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing , said that it had failed to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived for 20 years in the house to which the police were regularly called .
garbage and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the municipal house
he added : &quot; it is a disgrace that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of her family , since delocation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into account .
this was a very difficult case , because behavior was extreme and their actions had to be viewed terribly for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work done by my team , the police of Devon and Cornwall , and members of the community who have courageously gone to us and sent us the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and send the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress left on the ground in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delocation .
domestic workers will now have to weave waste mountains surrounding the house .
in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis and orphanages , paraphernals and cash worth Â£ 1,700 .
Skeldon received a fine after being guilty of owning a class B drug in commercial terms .
she claimed that the money was a tomb of her son Lee Skeldon , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being without obstruction , Tanya and her partner are now expected to live in private accommodation in Plymouth .
the staff were very friendly and helpful .
the police say that they will delocate tenants who do not comply with the house order
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police told us that delocation is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the house order .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without accusations , and to those who have been damaged by such behaviour , &quot; she said .
the Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour , which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal panic after a public military jet overflying beach
sun worshippers in Aveiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a Portuguese P @-@ 3C Orion airplane of the Air Force set an incredible storm flight .
the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no security risk .
this was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a titanium jet plunging over a full beach .
dramatic video shots showed how the military aircraft flew almost within reach over the sun on the beach in Aveiro , northern Portugal .
holidaymakers began understandably to worry about the noise of the nozzle works without first seeing what happened to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Aveiro .
Daniel Fernandes , one of the many holidaymakers who broadcast videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
Nuno Arroja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and fled incredibly deep
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deep that this was the only way to detect them .
the speaker said that due to poor visibility , the jet flew a little deeper than usual , but the air forces insisted that safety was never threatened at any time .
land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , with four people killed on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly so deep because of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - limiting his view .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup : Barca with worries about Seville
Seville - On Sunday , FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step towards the first title win in the new football season .
the Catalans enter the duel around the Spanish Supercup out against the FC Sevilla , and the return game rises three days later at Camp Nou .
the Doublewinner must give up on Neymar with the understated cupfinalist and ruling European League champion , among others , who denies Brazil the Olympic football tournament .
Goalie Marc @-@ Andre ter Stegen is also missing .
the German experienced a change in the knee during the training , which at least for the time being clarified in favour of Claudio Bravo .
the Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for number one status in Barcelona for two years .
Coach Luis Enrique so far renounced a clear decision in this regard and made Bravo stand in the league , but Ter Stegen performed in most other competitions .
before the first mandatory game of the new game , the Spanish Champion has doubts about the fitness condition of the team , which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
even at 3 : 2 in the trial against Sampdoria on Wednesday , Lionel Messi and Co didn &apos;t really convince .
Seville , for its part , has the 2 @-@ 3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and is seeking the second triumph in the &quot; Supercopa de Espana . &quot;
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition , with eleven successes so far .
ma Long in a separate league on table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his compatriot and &quot; title defender &quot; Zhang Jike 4 : 0 ( 12.5.4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
the World Cup , World Tour Final Tournament and Olympia .
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game , as expected , and made the title among themselves .
this made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the character of the five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympia stair was the former SVS NÃ Legion Ryu Seung @-@ min from South Korea .
ma and Zhang were left alone on the plate , they had no coaches between the sentences and time @-@ outs .
they had withdrawn from the gallery and left their guards alone in a fair competition .
&quot; I played the matches here for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Zhang had consistently said .
after the match , gold and silver medal winners ranked with the China flag .
the match itself was unexpectedly one @-@ sided .
ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Zhang only 13 points .
due to the superiority of Ma , the expected compelling match did not develop .
nevertheless , there were enough breathtaking changes in the ball .
Mizutani won the match for bronze against 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Samsonov 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov , the Belarussian had suffered a rib injury , after which he was treated as a doctor , had to &quot; finish &quot; with sheet metal .
by the way , Sweden Jan @-@ Ove Waldner ( 38 / 2004 ) and JÃ¶rgen Persson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become fourth in the same high table tennis age .
Donald Trump \ u0027s Election Problem
the US Republicans &quot; leaders are plagued by massive worries about losing a majority in traditionally conservative states .
President Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah .
a rare moment when the multimillion , usually large @-@ scale and self @-@ confident , expressed something like concerns , as correspondents reported .
after throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp , doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are growing .
&quot; we have huge problems in Utah , &quot; Trump said to evangelical Christians who asked for support in key states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia .
he was blamed for false reports of his candidacy , and he resumed his well @-@ known media sneakers .
crackling republican strongholds
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans .
according to a June SurveyUS poll , Trump and his opponent were the Democrats &quot; Hillary Clinton .
other institutions are ahead of Trump , but not with the distance customary for Republican candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk .
in an interview by CNBC , Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
and , finally , this will be &quot; successful , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he does nothing but &quot; tell the truth . &quot;
if , in the end , it is not enough for reasons of political correctness , Trump continued .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Trump party was threatened with withdrawing funds to support its campaign , should it not be able to present better survey values .
instead , Republicans &quot; candidates for Congress would be given more power .
Olympia : triple fraud in doping test
the IOC intends to set up a disciplinary commission on the case .
Kenias Leichtathleten is threatened by the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics .
after a fraud attempt at doping control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee announced that a disciplinary commission would be set up immediately to investigate the case .
a Kenyan official said that the former Sprinter and today &apos;s Coach , John Anzrah , gave a test of uranium in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre runner Ferguson Rotich .
this was reported to Kenya &apos;s team management by doping inspectors .
the IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to carry out its own investigations , with an IAAF spokesman .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC , the IAAF will carry out an assessment , &quot; he said .
&quot; he ( Anzrah ) has gone to the doping control station and has spent himself as Ferguson Rotich , delivered the sample and signed it , &quot; said Kenias Chief Mission Stephan Arap Soi .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency .
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in 2015 in Beijing .
four days earlier , the Kenyan Head of Mission Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about upcoming doping tests against cash payments by athletes in his country .
according to media reports , he was arrested when he returned to Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after many doping offences for some time .
when announcing the more than 2000 Doping target controls launched by the IOC before the Rio Games , it was unusually pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia are particularly targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games to create an anti @-@ doping law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic Games began .
as a result , WADA has withdrawn Kenya from the list of countries whose anti @-@ doping measures comply with WADA rules .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the country &apos;s key figures won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of ARD television reports , allegations have been made that drugs are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a considerable mentality in sports fraud .
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had done in Russian athletics .
it has been demonstrated that this sport has been extensively and systematically dopt .
Russia &apos;s passageways were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bartoli
in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic song , similar to Romeo and Julia .
a surprising Cecilia Bartoli .
a musical conquers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Leornard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and met with the role of Maria a youth dream .
the SimÃ³n BolÃ­var Orchestra , led by the Venetian conductor Gustavo Dudamel , is buried in the Orchestergraben : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he warms .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this stage Bartoli plays an older Maria .
she remembers her favourite with Tony while younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Maria has always fascinated me .
first because it is unique in music !
then there is Marias &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and witty and bright . &quot;
it is therefore wise , of course naive , and very passionate .
&quot; she very much resembles me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bartoli .
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is an honour for us to work with her .
she is an incredibly generous man .
and Bartoli returns the compliment : &quot; Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you can see it in each of its movements , in its eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temperament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important !
for American director Philip Wm . McKinley , the &quot; West Side Story &quot; is highly topical : &quot; this piece is about prejudices and fanaticism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Puertorians went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
these are the same issues and they are as meaningful today as they were then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girls joining ISIS killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana , one of three British schoolgirls left London last year to join ISIS , has been reported to have died in Syria .
Tasnime Akunjee , a lawyer , said that her family learned a few weeks ago about her death in Raqqqa , Syria .
it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa , the group &apos;s bulwark in the country , reported ITV News on Thursday .
sultana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she intended to leave the war @-@ torn land and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - preventing people from ever taking that decision , &quot; said Akunjee .
in February 2015 Sultana and two other schoolmates from the East of London climbed into an aircraft to Turkey , followed by a bus to the Syrian border .
Sultana &apos;s family was informed that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of a victory in Garland
Harry Reid , leader of Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate , Hillary Clinton , will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court .
the Senate Republicans have blocked Garland &apos;s confirmation since Barack Obama &apos;s nomination in March .
the majority leader of the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge to the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia .
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland &quot; with some certainty . &quot;
a spokesperson from Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he would speculate .
he praised Garland and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about a new candidate .
Garland is the chief judge of the US Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia .
RAID said that Republicans blocked the Garland nomination , be Lakaien and Helfer of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump .
he also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency .
treats wants Nacktkalendar for &quot; Women and Men &quot;
the Treats magazine works with the photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s Pirelli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine differs from Oldschool playboys , since &quot; Playboy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
he seems to think that the calendar is doing the same .
&quot; we need to return to the depiction of timeless and classic nudity , where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Shaw said in a press release on the publication of the calendars .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed caffeine , &quot; says Ercan Karakoyun , Chairman of the GÃ¼len @-@ close Foundation Dialogue and World .
the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing Turkey to Germany in the short term .
in the medium term , it could even become &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; says Ambassador Ali Toprak .
due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I expect tens of thousands , in the medium term , of thousands of people seeking protection from Turkey in Germany if the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says Ali Toprak of the &quot; World &quot; on Friday .
because the government had already overrun Kurdish strongholds with sanctions months ago , 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were fleeing .
after the failed coup , secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added .
many people in Europe will want to start again if they are further suppressed in Turkey .
said Toprak .
the Head of Mission deplored the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Algerian cities .
this is what Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or expelled in the last hundred years , &quot; said Toprak , who is also a CDU member .
the Head of Mission called for the Federal Government to &quot; position itself as strongly as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters . &quot;
in Germany , too , there is a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdogan critics .
I don &apos;t feel safe for the first time in Germany in recent months .
the German branch of the GÃ¼len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
fire marking as a GÃ¼len trailer destroys teachers and other academics &quot; professional existence .
said Ercan Karakoyun , Chairman of the GÃ¼len Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports with reference to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , even before the coup , the Turks constituted the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany .
by the deadline of 30 June , this was 11.386 people , representing almost 29 % of all asylum seekers ( 39.625 ) .
this survey does not cover the pre @-@ war , poverty or lack of prospects .

Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pomerania : &quot; go where it hurts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : local people are not allowed to vote for the summer election campaign - and holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 , the country elections will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwerin Parliament decided earlier this year .
this is not enough : summer holidays , heat and country elections - that is clear .
the locals , who are to be persuaded by the election fighters , are on holiday .
most of the country &apos;s holidaymakers on Usedom , RÃ¼gen or Hiddensee are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose Landtag .
there are practical problems with this : during the holidays , helpers who hang up posters , blow up balloons , distribute flyers and end up counting votes are just tired .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern will have to go through the popular campaign .
the hot phase , if you can say so at all , has just begun .
it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sellering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear for his post .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys .
it is exciting to see how much Neuling AfD cuts and what remains at the end of the coalitions .
Sellering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , is holding an almost inconspicuous election campaign , is seen from his large plaques .
he travels through the country , distributes roses and chat a little with people , just as his legendary vocalist predecessor Harald Ringstorff did .
otherwise , Seelering got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the bloom of the AfD .
their refugee policy , their &quot; We create it , &quot; has accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing populists , which is likely to cost him the beautiful job now .
the CDU , with its top candidate , the Minister for Home Affairs Lorenz Caffier , has already seen how it is when you campaign in the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale presentations ; Merkel is a federal constituency in the northeast .
but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority from other LÃ¤nder , &quot; Vincent Kokert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pomerania , recently indicted in NDR .
but it is also a pity not to hear Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany .
otherwise , the North @-@ East CDU largely renounces the usual election campaigns in marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons .
according to Kokert , this only plays a &quot; minor role . &quot;
the Union , too , has noted that , on the land , it is destroying the basis that it must make great efforts to find a link with the people .
you like the left , the SPD , the Greens : hardly any of the country &apos;s corners .
however , the Council of CDU campaigners , Kokert , is also self @-@ defeating : &quot; they must go where they are , namely where people are : thorns , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys , the Social Democrats last stood behind CDU ( 25 ) with 22 percent and just before AfD ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD won a clear 35.6 percent stake before the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Greens , a small party of seven per cent in the surveys , are likely to make a leap into the country &apos;s day .
they turn holiday distress into a modern virtue and spend much of their campaign on the Internet .
&quot; online campaign , &quot; it is called the country &apos;s president Claudia MÃ¼ller .
otherwise , green campaigners will be looking for local voters among holidaymakers .
Silke Gajek , the top candidate , is walking through the Mecklenburgische Lakes and finding it beautiful .
her impression : &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pomerania is not a punishment . &quot;
B27 rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from closure
the speed with which the B 27 is restored has nothing to mow .
there is widespread praise for those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends at 8 p.m.
&quot; they have made everything rather shaky , &quot; says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet petrol station .
that is a superteam .
there is no delay either .
the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week and everything should be ready by the end of October .
it also praises the accommodation of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the installation of container entrance .
since the construction site migrated to the south on Monday and the closure of the AspergstraÃe in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg is resumed , the traffic situation within the town has relaxed .
the citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen on both sides .
the traffic through the place seems to be falling .
&quot; there were some serious complaints , &quot; says Florian King , Deputy Chief Executive Officer responsible for transport management of rehabilitation .
the residents of BachsstraÃe , SteinlachstraÃe , HafnerstraÃe and Weiherrain had to contend with more traffic noise , because many narrow paths were looking for and more trusted with their Navi than with signage .
as a result , a number of lorries were framed in residential areas .
due to the fact that the speed limits were not adhered to , the municipality increased its demand for the measuring vehicle from MÃ¶ssingen .
&quot; there were significant exceedances , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation on the ground .
two to three per minute has already been cut .
the quickest way was by 77 km in the speed 30 zone .
since the construction site has continued , it has become more calm .
for business people on the B 27 , it is only a small consolation that the street is open again for Rottenburg customers .
business people are not welcome to look at the maps .
but the fact that the B 27 reorganisation has led to sales declines leaves everyone who is asked to look through .
however , some are more affected and some are less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; that is to say , produced for other companies , have little impact on the rehabilitation .
Thomas Sulz also talks about a &quot; at most slight decline &quot; in the car manufacturer Maier , but also acknowledges that , of course , the &quot; lack of circulation . &quot;
the most crowded are the restaurants along the street .
J. Albert GÃ¶hner , owner of the Steakhouse , formerly crown , is very clear .
this is already threatening existence .
not only him , but all restaurants &quot; hit hard . &quot;
customers from Hechingen , Balingen and Rottweil were missing .
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
it is estimated that sales fell by more than 50 percent .
road rehabilitation had &quot; thrown back two years . &quot;
half of his staff had to be made redundant .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been made redundant , politics would have reacted differently .
instead , President JÃ¶rg Schmidt responded to a question from GÃ¶hner as to whether there could be financial compensation by saying that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the B 27 situation .
GÃ¶hner knows of other counties where such a thing was handled more generously .
in all cases , GÃ¶hner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been here since 1715 , pointing to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests are less likely to miss because of the complex traffic management .
if you can &apos;t get there , it &apos;s also beautiful elsewhere .
GÃ¶hner has no doubt that his regular clients will return after the restoration work has finished .
despite the BSE and avian influenza crises , GÃ¶hner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clients to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history .
six months of construction work is already brutal .
laws are constantly being curtailed in the name of combating terrorism .
following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de MaiziÃ¨re is now presenting a thick security package .
but what is tolerance of terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de MaiziÃ¨re gives the reconciliation .
all his proposals are &quot; politically reasonable &quot; to the coalition partner , says the Federal Minister of the Interior in presenting his new security package .
they are not over @-@ demanding .
other more far @-@ reaching issues would initially be discussed within the parties .
I am also involved in this .
as Minister of the Interior , however , he wanted results and a &quot; achievable consensus &quot; within the coalition .
after the recent attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ansbach , de MaiziÃ¨re left a little time to present his conclusions on security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things are already known , proclaimed , inquired : that a new security authority should take care of breaking encrypted communications is not new .
nor is the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and arms law .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is no surprise either .
in part , de MaiziÃ¨re is launching a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to punish pro @-@ terrorist campaigns and to punish jihadists with double citizenship to remove the German passport .
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CDU man .
however , he feels that this is reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner has no chance of doing anyway .
de MaiziÃ¨re also presents some new ideas .
some of them have it in themselves : he is planning fast @-@ track procedures for deportation and more opportunities to arrest people before deportation .
refugees targeted to the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of tolerance for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to put some in a worse position than before - for example , those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity .
some of this is politically and legally sensitive .
some things are still unexplored and leave open questions .
and on some points - in the case of the unequal treatment of the patient , for example - the question arises : what is this really about security and terror ?
yes , says de MaiziÃ¨re that it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror .
but it cannot be denied that the attackers of Ansbach and WÃ¼rzburg were refugees .
moreover , many people were worried about security , given the high numbers of refugees .
and things that deeply employed people could not be excluded in election campaigns .
internal security has focused enormously .
only the attacks in the neighbourhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ansbach .
there is great uncertainty .
and yes , there are election campaigns .
the Union and the SPD are therefore becoming increasingly involved in internal security .
over the past few days , the two parties have been highly involved .
it is only a flagrant dispute over the provision of the Federal Police , then about a collection of security @-@ policy ideas by some Unions Interior Ministers , in which the heads of portfolios also demand a ban on burka and a departure from dual citizenship .
de MaiziÃ¨re , too , is tired of merry tones .
he does not think of a change from a double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
it makes no sense to reopen them .
and he has constitutional concerns about a ban on burka .
whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner has yet to show itself .
there is a lot in it that could cause controversy .
but the SPD is also trying to make a difference on internal security .
leader Sigmar Gabriel cautiously signals willingness to talk and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still glittering .
despite diesel scandals , deliveries worldwide are increasing .
but not all markets are involved .
in the case of revocation , there is a term for a term .
Volkswagen starts more restrained deliveries in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer , despite its many brands and some well @-@ underway markets , can continue to show an added value over the past year .
however , in July , the VW core brand weakened mainly in Western Europe , thereby again weighing up the total sales , as the company listed in the Dax reported .
the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less cars worldwide in July with 449100 cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China &apos;s second most important market , sales were 14 percent lower than last year .
at home market Germany , deliveries fell by almost a sixth .
brand leader JÃ¼rgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe .
moreover , in some core markets , &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; had reduced purchasing .
in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote to leave the EU also weighed down , a spokesperson explained .
in the United States , where exhaust gases initially escalated , there is also a minus to beech .
the strong support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is still glittering with the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only an export minus of 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles is due .
group Sales Head Fred Kappler continued to show a sales slogan from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period , worldwide 5.904 million .
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars to be converted to workshops .
as a result of the conversion VW confirmed that the conversion of cars had no negative impact .
there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after the vehicle has been upgraded .
after the conversion , the bus terminal provides the customer with a &quot; guarantee @-@ equal &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was said on Friday in business trips .
these are legal antagonisms .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now provides its German customers with a guarantee for converted diesel models .
this would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW must comply fully with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA . &quot;
&quot; deviations from this will not be accepted , &quot;
VW has taken the guarantee that after the conversion , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power will not deteriorate and that all typical vehicle values will remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was used in corporate travel .
in the broad term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , can get half a year after the conversion , with a motor damage to a workshop - and this could be attributed to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
in the interests of the customer , it is also important to prevent any other damage that has nothing to do with the dumping scandal from causing uncertainty as to possible warranty regulations , as it has been said .
that is why VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will require rich savers to pay interest - the second institute in Germany .
banker Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily cash accounts . &quot;
the Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an isolated case and sees no sign : ordinary savers &quot; do not have to fear paying for their austerity punitive duties . &quot;
camps banks pay money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 % penalty .
this fee will be charged by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September onwards by private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros into giro or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
said Paul .
he has been a guard against EUR 40 million for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he cannot exploit .
&quot; these are in my central bank account and are responsible for 0.4 % of the costs , &quot; said the banker .
&quot; I cannot spend every million EUR 4000 . &quot;
the costs are now passed on according to the polluter pays principle .
simply leaving the cash in the vaults of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t want to be the fifth ! &quot; said the Bank Board .
most customers would understand and switch to other types of investment .
few emigrated to other banks .
&quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy stance causes significant costs for all banks . &quot;
it is not possible to carry them alone .
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land , with its Skatbank branch , had made headlines in 2014 .
Michael Kemmer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association , said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to have to pay for deposits across the board , but competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong . &quot;
a banker said that on Lake Tegernsee there is &quot; a clientele that is somewhat more abundant in assets . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; if it cares for money free .
founded in 1911 , Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee , Rottach @-@ Egern , Kroth and Tegernsee .
famous actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
the Bavarian Association of Cooperative Societies &quot; does not currently know any other banks that charge a levy on private customers &apos; deposits , &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken ( BVR ) , Uwe FrÃ¶hlich , stated at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative towards the private customer is very , very , very high . &quot;
the competition was tough , and investor migration threatened to compete .
customers in Germany will not be satisfied with this in the breadth .
Destination plates : who actually buys records ?
lonely middle @-@ aged men love plates .
before you rush to the comment part to overrule it under the pseudonym Non @-@ Anglo @-@ Saxon Middle Ages with harsh insults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to YouGov , the much @-@ talked resurrection of records is not due to a boom in Millennium , which wants to welcome the novelty of physical objects , but to midlife nostalgia .
those who have recently bought a record are likely to be between 45 and 54 .
indeed , the 18 @-@ 24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group .
it is also not a hordes of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of YouGov ?
if this blog were a news report on television , the camera would follow me , while walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho , wearing a modest grey suit and stuffing wild before standing , holding my hands and saying something more decisive like : &quot; so let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let us look at it .
even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill up the buildings where once independent sellers were established - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I am close to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood by observing .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I followed by Sister Ray ( data count : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Reckless Records ( data count : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when she appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and embarrassed .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 1960s , early 1970s , when I was 11 or 12 .
he agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
that is my shop .
WEZ , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , also believes that many customers who meet him will be on the YouGov profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the Medienhpe , people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again .
of the conversations I have had , people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of record revival supporters of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like @-@ minded people .
according to Wez , some of the older customers took inspiration from the contactless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers , objects that wake up happily .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says Wez .
that is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people .
it is an easy way to deal with it mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; an employee flees from a stack .
a survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a disk do not have a record player .
at this point in the news report , I would probably be very concerned , while leafing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations .
Jonny , 42 , who works on Sounds of the Universe ( data count : three middle @-@ aged men ) , noticed a &quot; trophy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone came here recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it in the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a large percentage , but it is definitely happening .
more product @-@ oriented , less musical .
we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older people , who are only slowly arriving .
Fopp , which devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a colorful audience when I go .
there are couples around 70 , tourists taking photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Beasts of the latest synthesizer and sexpacked pop instead of experimental jazz , it is good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks rather unique , but needing mental trauma is difficult to detect if you are next to someone for 30 seconds .
Elanora , 27 , has been running in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it is more like a showcase than a big purchase .
she does not deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives with a beloved sigh .
I do not know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : URBAN Outfitters .
while I seem to be simulating jeans hotpants , I observe a group of young teenagers who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and daughter think about buying a Crosley record player .
to the left is a staircase , a wall full of noble , Jeff Buckley , Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorative , some so high that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but , given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items like plates .
even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are correct , they do not take into account , at least in record stores in Soho , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people probably work hard in school or in offices .
they certainly do not spend their Thursday morning with the butterflies through Berwick Street &apos;s record shops and leaves through plates , while avoiding the stubborn gaze of an implacable 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moderator who rises above the shoulders of unsuspecting middle @-@ aged men .
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report

French Court rejects offer to demolish shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to bring down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live .
in a trial this week , the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to dismantle 72 temporary shops where people sell goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offer hairdressing services , or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 pence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
Calais &apos;s prefecture argued that these places should be demolished , because they would be a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which would risk fire and sanity .
humanitarian groups informed the Court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also pointed out that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who operate the 72 provisional shops , but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot;
judge Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois Molla said that food shops , cafÃ©s , and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who &quot; live in extremely precarious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the low tide was the Jungle Book Kids &apos; CafÃ© of the camp , which is run by the public and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes and advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable , unaccompanied minors in the camp .
more than 170,000 people signed the petition to keep the Kids &apos; CafÃ© .
in a letter to the Guardian , it said that the closure &quot; would be a disaster for these children , of which the last eight years are old . &quot;
the two relief organizations Help Refugees and L &apos;Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a sharp increase in newcomers over the summer .
despite Olympia disappointment : Martin remains fierce

here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s Raser has to adapt to the next generation of speed meters : in various federal states , including Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which are intended to be particularly effective in transmitting packets .
Vitronic &apos;s futuristic Enforcement Trailer from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used at accident points where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , there is often no infrastructure needed to ensure that the speed limit is met with a stationary flash .
however , permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or burdensome .
the Enforcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology can also be used to track all vehicles across several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits and transit bans after time , driving tyres and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in high @-@ speed mode , the trailer can be moved with any car with a coupling .
so that it is not easy to clamp , it is lowered in the measuring operation so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and , incidentally , shaky outer case .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is designed to protect the flash from vandalism .
since 2015 Vitronic &apos;s trailer has been tested and used in various federal states .
foreign authorities are also glittering with the new technology : France recently ordered 100 pieces , after ordering 150 pieces last year .
Britain gets silver in 7 @-@ Series Rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ Series Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis , when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at Deodoro Stadium .
Fiji gave a master class in handling , side @-@ step , backward , line run and raw force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was swept away by the not @-@ so @-@ bad silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina , and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the boks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but , regardless of this , Fiji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in the best form .
it may be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Brite will have a gold medal tomorrow around his neck : Fiji &apos;s chief coach Ben Ryan , former head of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way to go .
eight years ago , Ryan lost every game at Adelaide Sevens .
here they lost only one .
this sleep will blow , but progress is astonishing .
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks crash out of fun .
it felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co .
Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner with four minutes of play .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a noble torch of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa reaching a third gate , but it stopped Fiji .
in the seventh minute JASA Veremalua leased a touch down in the right corner and it stood at 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nakarawa added a new one since the reanpfiff and there was still more than a minute game time ... in the first half .
Vatemo Ravouvou spoke with other weak Tacklings from the GB team and stormed to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the pause .
it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still learns .
that is the case .
GB made fundamental changes at half @-@ time and closed the fijian gap ... for a total of four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Josua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant play by Fiji .
dan Norton started an attempt for GB , made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South Sea explorer , whose fans sang , jumped flags and danced in the gallery .
it was not difficult to admire Fiji &apos;s playful approach .
Mata Viliame set the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
the pfiff wept , the fijis wrapped themselves and GB kicked in the lawn .
previously , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 , and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a narrow semi @-@ finals match - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footprint and reached a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ aside team , secured the profit - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the Blood of the Trainer
there will be no emotinal gold other than those games , and that &apos;s what it means .
from the first rudder to the last 220 hard hieve , which go into history , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa .
although it was only the two who sat at the helm , there were three votes in the boat .
their dominance was absolute , at least their 39.th unchallenged effort , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans , which does not fully reflect the type of triumph .
behind every gold in the run , there is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more helpful than the trainer , who , 30 months ago , did not know whether he would survive that day at all when cancer was diagnosed .
as he said , he was risky .
I had bubble cancer , which is operational and they did .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was fortunate that he could begin treatment in early 2014 , outside the season , which kept interruption to a minimum , if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice .
that is how it begins .
rowing itself is a challenge , but it makes it an even bigger one .
in the unemployability of the victory , her first thoughts were with Williams , who spent a nervous morning talking more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
Stanning , who was the head of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a mission in Afghanistan , said , &quot; I was an emotional wreck this week .
it only repeats how much this means to me , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him , he is the best coach in the world .
I could not have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer .
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be trapped .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not trying to do something great .
we did not want a firework today , we simply wanted to achieve a good result , we wanted to go further and win what we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before taking decisions about his future .
Glover must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I did not want to say that this was my last race .
that would have put too much pressure on us .
it took about six months in London to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was so new for me and I was so stretched .
it took about four minutes .
that feels much better , &quot; she said .
clarity for 31 years
the Managing Director of the &quot; Veitensteingruppe , &quot; Ruppert GÃ¶ller , is retiring .
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide exemplary . &quot;
a small Frenchman drinking water association as a model for large water producers .
this is what the original sound said some time ago in a speech by the Bavarian Radio .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Franks appreciated the purpose association .
the work of the Veitensteingruppe was regarded as exemplary throughout Bavaria .
behind all this is Rupert GÃ¶ller , who was a 31 @-@ year @-@ old member of the special purpose association , of which 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water association of the Veitensteingruppe , based in Kottendorf , municipality of Breitbrunn , promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with a population of about 5500 .
the municipalities of Kirchlauter , Breitbrunn , Lauter , Ebelsbach and Baunach are member communities .
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud BÃ¼hl ( FW ) , recalled that Rupert GÃ¶ller was hired as a water coach in 1985 and was already appointed Managing Director of the Object Association in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse , ranging from water management and maintenance work to office and organization activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends , &quot; said the Chairman .
she mentioned the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , the purchase of land in the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the restoration of the high reservoirs ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipelines .
there has been no standstill and there has been constant innovation , because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her Laudatio she praised GÃ¶llers for loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
just a few weeks ago , he was able to present the success concept of the Veitensteingruppe for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district .
he has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this .
Rupert GÃ¶ller , for his part , praised Alfons Griebel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best waterguard and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbeatable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he described the Brunnenbau and the restructuring of the purpose @-@ band .
however , the greatest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3 .
here , at minus 17 degrees , the whole night will have to work so that the villages can be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neubrunn could only have been maintained once , because the high container from Pettstadt was filled with hoses .
the management of the drinking water intended association was handed over to Daniel StÃ¼rmer from Lauter , who took over the succession of Rupert GÃ¶ller .
soprano Anna Netrebko deals openly with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Corriere della Sera . &quot;
when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed she had to die .
the now eight @-@ year @-@ old Tiago was well on the way and is now privately in New York , where the best therapists are .
&quot; to give an example : if I ask him something that was two years ago , when I sang at the Milan Scala , he remembers nothing , &quot; said Netrebko .
but he is the happiest man on earth .
Tiago comes from Netrek &apos;s connection with the Bassbariton Erwin Schrott .
she is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov .
marriage in Bargteheide - Man shoots for life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bargteheide ( District Stormarn ) on Friday at 10.45 a.m. and killed them .
&quot; the man himself called us and indicated that he had shot his companion , &quot; said a police spokesperson .
the perpetrator was fleeing , after which he was publicly punished .
now nationwide , because Sven S. could travel by car .
the man is about 1.80 meters in size , muscular , brown and has a leaf .
meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him .
but it is a few years old .
in the meantime the man wears a leaf .
the man should not be mentioned directly .
he could carry the weapon , says the police .
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police are talking about a &apos; relationship &apos; .
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetrator in 1981 .
the competent police in LÃ¼beck initially did not want to provide information on the course of the day or the relationship between the perpetrators and the victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; this is a crime of killing . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at the moment , &quot; said a police spokesperson in LÃ¼beck .
according to eye witnesses , a special mission ( SEC ) was at the scene .
steel - Light vision for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ stricken and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is being spared additional costs in millions .
financial burdens on the industry from green electricity production are on the table .
according to the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WAZ , Fridays ) , the German General Newspaper ( WAZ ) .
&quot; I am really pleased that we have finally achieved this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot;
the European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gas from the furnace to produce electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said to the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants will an EEG charge of 20 percent .
but this is not the case in the steel industry either .
the IG Metals welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the EU Commission on the production of electricity .
the status quo of the current regime would thus be broadly established .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry were particularly important .
&quot; with regard to our &quot; Steel is Future &quot; campaign , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot;
&quot; climate and employment targets also need to be weighed up in the reform of the emissions trading scheme , &quot; says IG Metal CEO JÃ¶rg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis .
last year , the situation continued to deteriorate as China &apos;s world &apos;s largest producer country , faced with weak domestic demand , threw steel on the world market .
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping .
during this spring , the situation has relaxed somewhat .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on imports have an effect on imports , and on the other , the economic outlook in China has deteriorated .
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German branch primary Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday .
finally , prices would have stagnated again .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain cautious , despite rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced just six per cent less crude steel than in the previous month , as reported by the Steel Association on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the amount produced has now returned to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent lower than the previous year .
the association expects an increase in output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : good singing for seniors
the Singen has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in Lehramt studies she taught music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a sample she feels balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says .
by the way , she is doing her health and spirit a good job .
for Singen is a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League .
most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describes Hackler .
regular interaction allows seniors to establish and maintain social contacts .
because social and family structures often emerge at age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir : &quot; to deny and organize , to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of unity . &quot;
singing can be tough in a positive sense , says Hackler .
seniors train deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly ask for their lungs do not get out of the purest so quickly in everyday life .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at age , Singen is an ideal hobby .
Singen often has a very special effect on elderly people , says Ursula Lenz of the German Association of Senior Citizens &apos; Organisations .
in the older generations , common singing was much more important ; it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , explains it .
Lenz often observed that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories , often combined with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and melodies in particular , self @-@ dementia @-@ sufferers escape from long @-@ standing events .
in addition , when singing , a special performance is required for the head , explains Lenz .
at the same time , focus on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm , adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
older people who live alone practice not only focusing on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition of singing in the choir , says Hackler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ esteem also grows through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I long for something , I will be better and more vigilant beyond me - this experience will be strengthened .
so there are good reasons to start singing .
if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if you think you have little talent , let Lenz know .
you do not sing alone - 50 singing people , who is listening when a sound goes by ?
in search of the suitable offer senior citizens have different possibilities , says Hackler .
if someone sings from the audience in a senior choir , you can easily join .
many cities also offer views of the villages surrounding them .
if you want to sing in a church choir , you can contact the parish or church leader directly .
many senior citizens can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the Internet search .
if you want to sing , please join a choir , Hackler .
singing does well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages .
cats respond more sensitively than kittens to the horrors of young animals
biologists in Hanover have studied the effect of crying cat babies on adult animals .
to their surprise , the men were not cold either - but , unlike the females , they were always the same .
female cats can see the level of fatigue of cat babies when they mix the little ones .
they react 10 % faster to the sounds of kittens who are in great need , as scientists from the veterinary college and the Medical University of Hanover ( MHH ) found .
Kater also responds to kittens &quot; calls - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between miking less and heavily stimulated young animals are either unperceptible or not important for men , &quot; said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of MHH .
she is a dentist of the study published this Friday in the magazine &quot; BMC Evolutionary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kittens &apos; shrines are different from the urgency of their need for assistance .
a total of nine adult kittens and eight female kittens from MHH were observed .
they were played on the one hand by small boys who were taken out of the sausage box for three minutes and were separated by mother and siblings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cries of more intense kittens , which were also raised .
researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample .
&quot; all females , even those who have not yet had their own young people , reacted differently to the horror , &quot; said Konerding .
they turned around faster to the loudspeaker when this call was played by the very rugged kittens .
this ability may be inclined or developed with gender maturity .
&quot; one surprise was that the men reacted at all , &quot; said the biologist .
in the past , scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noise on several occasions in humans .
some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants , whether they were mothers or not , reported the biologist Marina Scheumann .
Podolski enters Supercup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hakan SÃ¼kÃ¼r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan SÃ¼kÃ¼r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match is taking place in Turkey .
before the duel of the archrival between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski &apos;s Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
even when the state of emergency was imposed after the storm attempt in July , the government estimated that the daily lives of ordinary citizens should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah GÃ¼len , who is blamed for the coup attempt .
nor will it stop before football .
the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against former Starkicker Hakan SÃ¼kÃ¼r .
so the South Coast now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
SÃ¼kÃ¼r is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah GÃ¼len , who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt .
although the state of emergency for 90 days is still in force until October , in fact , it has virtually no impact on the lives of most Turks .
Erdogan declared his nocturnal &quot; democracy guards &quot; in public places throughout the country on Wednesday .
sport , like the whole country , is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan .
fans of the Besiktas Workers Club in particular are traditionally not friends of the president .
but what unites the majority of Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups .
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats Galatasaray or Besiktas .
&quot; Gala &quot; Cup winner will see Lukas Podolski again .
in the past season , Cologne proved its sporting value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first time as a top scorer of his club .
in the final match against Fenerbahce , he scored 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; Fanatik &quot; applauded him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he has completed the season in an excellent way and secured the Cup for his team .
thanks to &quot; Poldi , &quot; the disappointing season for the record champion was a reconciling one .
after the round @-@ table K.o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also varied early in the European League .
in the SÃ¼per Lig it was only six .
the season was not good .
the Pokal was the only way to win something .
&quot; that is what we have achieved and that is the most important thing , &quot; Podolski said .
for Master Besiktas the year went better .
especially thanks to Mario Gomez , who set the foundation for the 14th title with 26 martyrs as SÃ¼per @-@ Lig @-@ goers .
this is also why fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the same time , the Gomez Treaty Treaty and Besiktas only announced after the coup attempt not to return due to the political situation in the country after its EM holiday .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; Kicker &quot; Clubchef Fikret Orman .
to this end , however , the stormer would have to be prepared to give up around a third of its annual salary , estimated at EUR 7.5 million , Orman made it clear : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite doping : these athletes still have medals in Rio Olympia
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gatlin was already locked twice for doping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa must not start in Rio .
other committed paschtathletic sins can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio .
the issue of doping continues to determine the headlines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa , who , after a doping blockade , had indicted her start right shortly before the games , was unscrupulously shot and burned out at her start ( 100 meters breast ) .
it was a bizarre scene : she was still staged into the hall with her appearance .
when it was established that she would not bring gold , the audience broke into a jubilee storm .
but there are many other athletes who , despite the doping past , are starting at the Rio Olympics .
an overview :
Justin Gatlin ( 100 , 200 , 4x100 @-@ m @-@ Staffel / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics .
he was already locked twice for doping ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its inception , the 2004 Olympic champion and former World Champion have been running even faster than before , being the number one in the world in more than 100 m in 9.80 seconds , and is considered to be the biggest challenge for Usain Bolt .
Shelly @-@ Ann Fraser @-@ Pryce ( 100 , 4x100 @-@ m @-@ Staffel / Jamaika ) : the two @-@ man Olympic champion and seven @-@ fold World Champion had to sit down a six @-@ month @-@ long lock in 2010 after she was proven to take the pain agent Oxycodon .
she had strong toothache after an operation , defending her 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Perkovic ( Diskus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , World Champion from 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 , was positively tested for the banned stimulants methyl hexanamine .
Perkovic denied the wisdom and was imprisoned for six months .
the four widest sausages this year go to the account of the great gold favorite .
LaShawn Merritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x400 @-@ m @-@ Staffel / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ man World Champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and was suspended for 21 months .
a method of penis enlargement was responsible , expensive merging .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world .
Iwan Tichon ( Hammerschlag , WeiÃrussland ) : hardly any athlete has been discarded afterwards .
for example , Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later , after he discovered testosterone doping .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to surrender Olympic silver in 2004 for steroid doping and the EM title 2006 for testing osterone abuse .
he was awarded the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games following a judgment of the International Sports Court CAS .
at 80.04 m , he ranks two of the world &apos;s top ranking .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record writer and gold favorite was only tested positively in May , but is still allowed to start in Rio .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old World Champion found indications of the use of a banned food supplement , the ban on the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency WADA was mild and expired on July 13 .
bombings in Thailand - Austrian injured - multiple deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said Thomas SchnÃ¶ll , Speaker of the Foreign Ministry .
she had suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital , but had already been able to leave .
her home trip was scheduled for early September .
whether the further explosions on Phuket and Surat Thani , Phang Nga , Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens remains unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard ,
in Hua Hin , approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital city , two bombs were exploded at first on Thursday evening in an outlet .
according to the police , a Thai woman had been killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrians , three Germans , three Dutch and three Italians .
on Friday morning two jumps went up again , with another man killed , according to the authorities .
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured at the Detonation near the Patong beach , which is popular with holidaymakers .
in Surat Thani , on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb killed an urban worker .
according to the authorities , the springboard had gone into the air in front of the revolt of the coastal police .
finally , detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south @-@ west coast and Chumphon on the south @-@ east coast claimed several injuries .
one assumes a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin , it was said .
&quot; the bombings carry the same handwriting , &quot; Armeegeneral Danai Kritmethavee told journalists on Friday morning .
&quot; we expect this to be a coordinated attack . &quot;
it is too early to comment on possible motives - but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or to international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sabotage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok .
instead , they assume that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta .
over the past few days , the authorities have received intelligence about upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact timing and location .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas .
in Thailand there are always smaller bombings , but most of them are not directed against tourists .
Hua Hin is a palace used by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej for years .
following the current bombings , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that it should follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high safety risk ( safety level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat , Yala , Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings .
after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , unnecessary journeys to these provinces will be lost .
increased security risk ( safety level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta .
this will give the military great influence in the coming years .
junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , improving the economic situation and tourism .
the military unta , which took power after a period of bloody unrest in 2014 , benefits itself from restoring stability and order to the Kingdom .
but the military has not managed to control the revolt of Muslim rebels that has been raging in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
more than a year ago , an attack on a popular Hindu shrine killed 20 people in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloodiest attack on the country &apos;s recent history .
the right &quot; Identity Movement &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
after several provincial offices , the constitutional defenders in the federal government also observed the group .
&quot; we see evidence in the &apos; Identitarian Movement &apos; of efforts against the liberal democratic order &apos; , said Constitutional Protection Chairman Hans @-@ Georg MaaÃen of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are being discriminated against in an extremist way .
that is why we are now seeing the movement .
the &quot; Identity Movement &quot; is a group of French roots which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it opposes &quot; multiculturalism , &quot; &quot; uncontrolled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity by exaggeration . &quot;
constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ WÃ¼rttemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the &quot; identities . &quot;
Mr MaaÃen said that his authority had been closely associated with the national authorities in the decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Identity Movement &apos; are trying to collect their target group where they stand , &quot; said the head of the Constitution .
in general , extremists try to address them with youth @-@ oriented language , often with poppies .
Islamists and right @-@ wing extremists alike .
this is not a shameful advertisement for your own cause .
propaganda should address people emotionally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
that is dangerous .
most recently , there have been reports from several federal states about contacts between &quot; identities &quot; and AfD politicians .
he said that he had no knowledge of this .
for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view .
it is important that the party concerned - in this case the AfD - changes its direction by certain people who are extremist , and becomes so extremist .
it is therefore crucial whether such people have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not evident .
in view of the significant increase in lawfully motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation , Mr MaaÃen said that he was not yet talking about new right @-@ wing terrorism .
however , we have seen in recent years that there can be legal terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Freitaler Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or micro @-@ groups are being formed , which are planning attacks on asylum seekers , on refugee homes or attacks from other far @-@ right extremist motives .
but there is no sign of a German or European @-@ wide control of legal terrorism .
the previous groups were created at regional level or in social networks .
worried about many attacks on the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
that is the worrying thing .
many suspects in attacks on asylum @-@ seekers had not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or right @-@ wing supporters .
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extreme right @-@ wing extremists who may have been politically indifferent or , for example , elected CDU , SPD or left , but who have radicalized themselves by right @-@ wing extremist sentiments . &quot;
Rio 2016 : ROBEL Kiros Habte becomes Internet hub
the Olympic Games or World Records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games .
this shows ROBEL Kiros Habte &apos;s courageous performance at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aquatics Center , the slightly overweight swimming pool from Ethiopia flowed so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV images .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
in the social networks , Habte subsequently became a viral Internet thite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old , with a delay of 48 seconds , ended his lead and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters .
however , it was his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why is the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participating in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiopian got special start rights from the International Swimming Federation .
this is distributed to promote swimming in underrepresented countries .
since most athletes are running in orthopia , Habte simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race .
the first nicknames quickly made the round .
some media called him &quot; ROBEL der Wal . &quot;
the English tabloid &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; Dad Bod &quot; made fun of him .
his time , he beat only with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freistil , played no role .
comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , Eric Moussambani took media attention .
the performance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was an unforgettable experience , when he had to go on his own in a run @-@ up of more than 100 metres of Freistil .
Moussambani was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Geretsried - The owner of a shop in the New Square has been stolen .
according to the police , 67 @-@ year @-@ old Geretsriederin left their shop on Monday at 5.30 p.m. , forgetting to close a window on the ground floor .
when she came back at 8.15 a.m. the next morning , about 250 euros had disappeared .
traces of the perpetrator could not be found .
there is no video surveillance either .
Trump does not see the impending electoral defeat so narrowly
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if it does not become a US president , Donald Trump already has an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November , that would not matter to him : &quot; ultimately , it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said Republican candidate in a telephone interview with CNBC .
if , for reasons of political correctness , it is not enough for him , Trump said .
he described US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founder of the Islamic State &apos;s terrorist militia ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance emerged .
post enters the trade in electric transport
an electronic delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action .
there seems to be a great deal of interest in vapour for other companies .
the Post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter .
shortly the Group will start trading with the transporter .
the post office plans to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year .
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post spokesman on Friday .
the company has been investigating for months whether to sell to other companies their own developed StreetScooter , which supplies letters and packs .
post @-@ CEO JÃ¼rgen Gerdes had said that there were constant questions , for example from craftsmen .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonner Group intends to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly .
in the post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Gerdes had announced that the Group would significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and , in the long term , would like to see a complete switch to environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; we will take a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July .
I can imagine that we are changing the entire fleet .
the StreetScooter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
CSF leadership defaults after disappointing business figures
the consumer research firm GfK will replace its head Matthias Hartmann .
the resignation came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the longer the success he promised , the more the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes less secure .
turmoil at the head of Nuremberg &apos;s market research company GfK : after again disappointing business figures and the company &apos;s resignation , the industry &apos;s worldwide number five is facing a new start .
GFK CEO wants to leave the company by the end of the year .
the Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahert already leaves the Supervisory Board as of 12 September .
as early as September 1 , the Executive Board member Gerhard Hausruckinger informed the company .
he will officially assume the role of a &quot; CEO &quot; until a successor to Hartmann is found .
as a reason for the withdrawals , the company called &quot; different views &quot; on the long @-@ term business orientation .
details a company spokesman did not want to mention on Friday .
those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear .
in investor circles , it was said on Friday that shareholders were last disappointed with the continued success of the restructuring that began years ago .
Mr. Hartmann has been the GfK leader since 2011 .
&quot; however , the fruits of restructuring cannot be seen after 5 years , &quot; he said .
in view of the most recent bad GfK business figures , each shareholder will eventually become unsettled .
&quot; if this were the case with BMW , the quandts would do so , &quot; he said .
in the second quarter of 2016 , the company had not been able to stop its loss path following setbacks in the previous quarter .
at EUR 361.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent lower than in the comparable quarter of the previous year .
in terms of the first half of the year , sales fell by 3.4 percent , at EUR 721.2 million .
profit in the second quarter has been particularly affected by the company &apos;s declining value in view of its difficult economic situation .
the company depreciation of EUR 139 million , which has become necessary in the Consumer Experience business , resulted in a loss of EUR 148.2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , GfK generated consolidated profits of 19.7 million .
accidents - Bus slips into Krummhorn in Graben : eight injured
in the event of an accident involving 43 seniors as passengers , eight people were injured in KrummHÃ¶rn ( Aurich district ) on Thursday .
two of the inmates suffered serious injuries , informed the police .
according to her , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to evade a shop that was partly on the opposite track .
the bus came to the right of the street and slipped into a grave , as a spokesperson of the police Aurich / Wittmund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said .
the fire brigade freed the occupants .
six rescue vehicles and one emergency medical vehicle arrived at the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the remaining travelers were brought back to Krummton &apos;s Pewsum district by a bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
the investigators asked the lorry driver and possible witnesses to report to the police .
charges per cubic metre of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros ; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros ( up to 2.26 euros ) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros ( up to now 2.18 euros ) .
at the Azendorf plant , the waste water charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvements are necessary .
after a surplus calculation , the waste water price in Azendorf will be EUR 4.37 per cubic metre .
as Mayor Bernd SteinhÃ¤user ( CSU ) reported , when approving the household by the Councillor Kulmbach , undercover was found for these wastewater plants .
on the basis of legal bases , the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants at a cost @-@ effective price .
as of 1 October 2016 , citizens and businesses from Welschenkahl , Neudorf , Reuth , Azendorf , Lopp , Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse .
the fee increases range from 48 % to 67 % .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel , a recalculation of charges for the waste water treatment facilities of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over- or undercover from the previous calendar period should also be compensated .
the serious increase in charges led Schmidt to the fact that all three waste water plants are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water treatment rate ranging from 6800 to 12000 cubic metres per year .
for example , due to the low distribution base , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
furthermore , wastewater supply in all three plants has been slightly reduced .
in addition , during the last calendar period , all three plants have suffered a considerable amount , not least because of their age of rehabilitation and repair .
the facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for Welschenkahl , Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg , Lindenberg and Lopp are nearly 20 years old .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf sewage plant due to damage .
in the Welschenkahl pump plant , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor plants had to be overhauled from scratch , and after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be disposed of , sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to meet water requirements .
Schmidt : &quot; these exceptional expenses have been met by the advanced maintenance and care costs which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still well below current levels in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
SteinhÃ¤user made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants , the costs of operation and maintenance will be &quot; fully realised . &quot;
Schmidt added : &quot;
in the view of SteinhÃ¤user , the situation for these plants will continue to be precarious in the long term , especially as the Friesenbachtal wastewater treatment area cannot be extended by these plants because they are deficient facilities .
Bulgaria recorded inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first above zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
annual average inflation over the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) was -0.8 % compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared with June 2016 was 101.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
inflation has been -0.2 % since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared with December 2015 ) and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
in July 2016 , compared with the previous month , prices rose among the following groups of consumer goods : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell for clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained unchanged as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication and education .
snapchat &quot; Anime &quot; effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is anime @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is unsensitive to races .
with its filter tool , Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a pineapple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting .
the filters are unveiled , proprietary tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies a day .
all misdeeds come to the public .
snapchat filters have in the past attracted criticism , alleging that the App Blackface would promote or promote white skin as a beauty solution .
this week , when some users proposed a filter that gave them snake eyes , false teeth , and darkened cheeks , some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - &quot; Yellow Sight . &quot;
they wondered whether these repeated controversies highlighted a major problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indignation were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Verge and Motherboard , one day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature .
the company offered an apology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians .
but outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of vulnerable clichÃ©s .
others firmly rejected the Anime comparison .
in an email Grace Sparapani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and , to say the least , unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reprehensible Asian cartoon and filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ transparent , but that the yellow view has been pulled into the decreasing extreme .
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling blocks .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless campaign of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold .
and Snapchats &quot; large audience of young people - who are different in terms of race than their older opponents - could rather expect sensitivity .
if one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is offensive to a user , &quot; so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than they used to be , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Zhu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snapchat account called on others to do the same .
in a paper for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believed that race @-@ related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices at Snapchat .
Zhu criticized the largely white , male leader and ended her performance with a hashtag : # DeleteSnapchat .
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so that they can make such choices , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American zhu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors working there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable , to say what about it . &quot;
others share their views , a complaint that Snapchat has largely failed to answer .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokesperson , the company recently recruited a personnel officer who focused on underrepresented communities and on internal integration efforts .
Zhu , for his part , said that she will close her Snapchat account and added , &quot; I wonder if she needs more users like us to say that this is not O.K. &quot;
military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence , says Congress Committee
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed a Congress committee of inquiry to report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee , secret service committees , and the Wehrmacht , reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of America &apos;s efforts to fight the Islamic State .
the Central Command ( Cencom ) is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence @-@ related information typically obtained by high @-@ level CENTCOM commanders was regularly more positive than other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; what happened at CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Calvert , Republican member of the House of Representatives .
the leadership errors in CENTCOM range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi forces .
though it does not provide direct evidence that Obama &apos;s leaders have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts have been exposed to pressure from their prerogatives to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions , and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts , &quot;
for example , a CENTCOM member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mossul , Iraq &apos;s second largest city , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
said Mike Pompeo , Republican Congressman from Kansas .
from mid @-@ 2014 to mid @-@ 2015 , central command leaders changed intelligence reports to downplay ISIS &apos;s risk in Iraq .
Republicans launched the Task Force after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about manipulating reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed information while the investigation will continue .
in addition , further CENTCOM reports are under way by the General Inspector of Defence .
democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , CENTCOM created an excessively restricted process for the production of intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services , &quot; said the High @-@ Level Democrat in the Committee , Member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Ship .
this process , Mr. Ship said , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; damaged morality among analysts and &quot; gave too little room for dissenting opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Ship and the Democrats indicated that they had not found any evidence of intervention by the White House by CENTCOM analysts regarding a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress &apos;s investigation were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspector , which were received after complaints from CENTCOM analysts .
Cmdr. Patrick Evans , a Pentagon press officer , stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congressional reports , while the investigation of the general inspector was still under way .
but he also said that &quot; experts sometimes have very divergent views on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . &quot;
the investigation has repercussions beyond the issue of a successful US @-@ led air campaign in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of defense officials ) .
but last year &apos;s accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and other crisis regions .
the criticism of secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of incidents of more than ten years ago , when a CENTCOM analyst , Gregory Hooker , wrote a document about how the then George W. Bush administration , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , saw only a small occupying force in Iraq and left little time to think about the invasion in 2003 .
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team around Mr. Hooker , according to government officials , found that , contrary to the government &apos;s statements , aerial strikes against refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refineries would have started operating to sell oil on the black market .
this insight was not published , however , reported to the Times in September .
Centcoms then commander Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessively positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command .
the US wins fourth match in women &apos;s field hockey , and a showdown with Britain is imminent
one day after having shot three gates over Japan during a 6 @-@ 1 victory , Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American women &apos;s field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement , but Bam ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever did .
she said .
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory .
but she knows that : the American women are in the Olympic race at 4 @-@ 0 and are on the same footing in their group with the British in the first place after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter finals , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place in their group .
the first place will be a little longer for the strong Dutch women who lead the other group .
whatever the game starts on Saturday , the American women have sparked a surprising bloom through their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 places in London .
BAM was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time at the age of three had a hockey sleeper in her hands ( her two older sisters played sport at Drexel University ) , she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the Kader .
then came 2012 , when everything went wrong for them and their team .
in the following year , Craig Parnham , an Englishman , coach of the national team , started to turn to better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said Bam .
we did not have the workload in London that we now have .
we have been able to throw away the rudder completely .
on Thursday evening Bam opened the door rigging in the first half of the game with a back hand from the nearby area .
India had gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly hesitant and held the match from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands .
she completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank , then moved to the center and lured the ball to give the American women a 2 @-@ 0 leadership .
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US Torkeeper , Jackie Briggs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous matches .
it has a course .
like Bam .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Parnham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the midst of the era of the Olympic Games , the Zen des Trampolins
wherever you are , however late it is , there are the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable , a fast track between competition and ambition .
it is as if the Olympic torch was itself a burning stack , stretching from the bracelet to the swimmer to the triathlete .
you cannot turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles , Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
and then there is Logan Dooley .
Dooley , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s swarm with horror , could well have been among these well @-@ known names that are sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and good @-@ health TV advertising if he were a swimmer , turner or even a fan .
but Dooley , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline .
the Olympic flame does not illuminate every event .
further from the centre , in some shadows there are sports that are not generally recognised : aerial pistol shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
we will always have the chest swimming and may it prevail for a long time .
but if I may make modest arguments for my particular favorite , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of Trampolin .
although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it has been perceived so sparingly over the past 16 years that many people who I had asked did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the US sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping , and by 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final .
the Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women .
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain outside charm , partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but just an earth @-@ bound enthusiasm .
it has humoristic potential - the cartoonical quotation of its never @-@ ending cloudy impact - but also the grace of the turtle and diving , the two sports it essentially unites .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Trampolin , which means &quot; jumping board . &quot;
rising winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air , and must have a series of falling movements ( turning , lifting and saltos ) before they land on their feet .
according to the official Olympic programme , they are evaluated according to the performance , difficulty level and flight time .
two @-@ way athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic vector is straight .
medal @-@ hungry must go up and down in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down in the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall , but also another cave @-@ like goal in television broadcasting : that of the world or the Olympic record .
the purposeful pursuit is noble , admirable , even fanatical - and it is enough to even throw a spectator into tears .
but it is also what I find somewhat arduous when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a respite .
the vector of the trampoline jumper is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she jumps up , seemingly heavy as an astronaut , then down , then effortlessly upwards .
here too there is competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal , no wolves into the distance , only the dreamy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is just as tough as competition can be at the Olympic Games .
women &apos;s qualifications and endings will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 1.00 Eastern Time ; men &apos;s training sessions will also take place on Saturday at 1.00 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the endings as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
amid the Olympia mania , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general .
if the raising of awareness can only be achieved through the creation and objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turners recently proposed , according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his air @-@ going new fan community .
&quot; one generation protested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with violent opposition from the government .
witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during shooting .
is Ethiopia in the process of collapsing ?
over the past decade , it has been one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West , with a rapidly growing economy .
but , in recent months , protests against the government have shocked the country and expanded to more and more areas .
last week , thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was unmerciful .
witnesses indicated that policemen shot and killed on tens of unarmed demonstrators .
videos circulating about the protests that are likely to be from last year or beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to take a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in @-@ depth investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future , &quot; said Rashid Abdi , Project Leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if any , receive so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
although Ethiopia was far from a model of democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the government &apos;s repression - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissidents effectively silenced .
many have been sent to exile or prison , killed or driven to the foothills of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you suppress people and have no other options but to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Seyoum Teshome , a lecturer in central Ethiopia .
all young people are protesting .
a generation is protesting .
there are many complaints that cover everything from land use to sword about the power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely criticised election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 % of Parliament .
at the same time , tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea ; a battle for this tortuous , controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front , which have been more or less enforced in recent years , could exploit turbulence and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years of adrenaline .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate via social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more common and Internet services have improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially during protests , many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiopians said they had gathered for protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies .
for the time being , Amharas , who come from orthopedic predominantly Christian highlands , have prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos , many of whom are Muslims and live in lowlands .
but that too is changing .
&quot; we are coordinating under a umbrella , &quot; said Mulatu Gemechu , leader of Oromos .
the biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos .
many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by Tigray ethnic groups , which account for around 6 % of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence , trade , and politics .
the third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi .
Mr Meles , a former rebel leader , was Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister for 17 years until he died from an unpublished disease in 2012 .
he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly confident in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special envoys to treat opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; Mr Abdi said .
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , Hailemariam Desalegn , was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles .
unlike Mr Meles , who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr Hailemariam comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray @-@ controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more bloodshed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such an uprising in 2005 , after thousands of protests against elections that , according to analysts , appear to have been consumed by the government and then stolen .
during the subsequent raids , many protesters were killed , even though it was less than in recent months , and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new shuttle train , and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this did not prevent the Ethiopian Government from intensifying its internal maladministration .
and it is taking a dangerous ethnic form .
last month protesters attacked in Gondar , an amusing city , run by Tigray , and hatred of Tigray is becoming increasingly common in social media .
analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights across neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it had closed that base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area .
&quot; this , &quot; Mr Abdi said , &quot; is a very thin grass @-@ roots hike . &quot;
Donald Trump explains Obama &apos;s claim to have founded ISIS &quot; sarcasm &quot;
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by suggesting that his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were not meant seriously .
this clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate &apos;s ability to communicate with the American public whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligently .
it also brings his fellow combatants , who are trying to protect him during an eventful period , into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant .
after making the suggestion at an election campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Trump reverted to the claim on Thursday , insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr Trump said that he was simply sarcastic .
the tweet was the contrast to the previous day , when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he was absolutely serious about the accusation .
when the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt sought to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism has slowed down on Mr. Trump , while trying to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling demand levels .
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton made speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr Trump tried to return to this issue .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring .
Mr Trump has already raised sarcasm for his defense .
at the end of July , he drew strong criticism when he said that Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he said &quot; Of course I meant the sarcastic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Trump to shift language boundaries in politics and then to roll back as necessary .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans , how they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the response is . &quot; said Ruth Sherman , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates .
I also believe , however , that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Trump has taken an even more noble tone , as his survey numbers have fallen further .
a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist , published on Friday , showed a leadership with a great advantage in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr Trump generally tries not to apologise for his provocative remarks , he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour .
but , while he focuses more attention in recent months on his presidential campaign , Mr. Trump &apos;s henchmen have put his loyal supporters in the uncomfortable situation of standing with him , no matter how provocative his statements may be .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , a former mayor of New York and one of Trump &apos;s most prominent advocates , has worked hard to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuliani on the accuracy of Mr. Trump &apos;s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
in this sense , it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown small organization , he called it backbenders , completely wrong , and it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Republicans try to argue that Obama &apos;s administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed ISIS to spread by refusing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East .
before Friday &apos;s election campaigns in Pennsylvania , Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being biased against each of his words .
he mocked the &quot; poor , distressing &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can not ! . &quot;
some of the Democrats mocked Mr Trump &apos;s apology as yet another demonstration that he was unsuitable for the presidency .
once squeezed out of the market , CafÃ© in Greenpoint returns
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafÃ© in Williamsburg , where you could only pay for bar , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices of his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront were squeezed out .
the Soap Cherie business , which replaced Verb in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cupcakes .
it was the last loss in a city in which the population of the country was estimated .
the artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is a change , it is also a rediscovery .
a revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafÃ© , who is the owner and manager of the new cafÃ© .
he started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him money for a new outsider , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , maintained a lot .
Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodriguez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese , and there are garnishes such as capers and acidic onions .
there are nature tours .
the cafÃ© no longer serves beer , for which there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodriguez said that he had noticed a constant stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer .
Oliveira , 34 , used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verse regularly .
even after moving to Greenpoint , it would take the path .
after the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee rings for a while , she said .
&quot; it became clear to me that it was because of coffee and culture that I liked , &quot; she said .
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced coffees , which is another new addition .
Tom Rosenthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verse in 2003 .
he went to work there and inevitably ordered the same thing .
&quot; I arrived quarter after seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Rosenthal still receives his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything Bagel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said that he was not concerned that the soap business took over the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold @-@ baked coffee of the cafÃ© as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go into her offer , &quot; said Rodriguez .
and the traditional Polish residents Greenpoints also accepted the cafÃ© .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to issue it soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold baked coffee in the bottle .
there is a chance that the cafÃ© will expand to a neighbouring building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the cafÃ© closed .
when the new cafÃ© opened , Whitt said that entering the place and ordering felt like returning home .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the depressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise as president , Franklin Delano Roosevelt began his lunch at the Oval Office .
as a gourmet , President Roosevelt had a faible for sophisticated Fifth Avenue delicacies such as PÃ¢te de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup .
his menu this day was slightly more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potatoes and dessert a plum pudding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegelman .
her husband Andrew Coe added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans about how to eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Coes &quot; last book &quot; Chop Suey &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the US , while in her book &quot; 97 Orchard , &quot; Ziegelman tells about life in a housing house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear at Harper Verlag on Tuesday , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter in the Eisenberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small snack in the Flatiron District , which has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash .
Ziegelman , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese orchard with olive pieces , while Coe , 57 , Truthahn with potatoes and vegetables .
when the reporter ordered hackbrates , this found the couple appropriate for a discussion about eating in the Great Depression era .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; Ziegelman said .
there were geese bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pears that they serve as dinner .
Coe grinded .
he said .
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat buffet in an American household , especially in rural areas .
women &apos;s teams cook for male fellows and freshly baked pasta is served for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Meal &quot; points to the ways in which the country was no longer a closed country .
&quot; it was a time when food became a central , tense topic for Americans , &quot; Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
just as eagerly awaited was the new budget diet : mysterious dishes such as bread and casserolls became basic foods , the casserolle as &quot; wonderful way to recycle food remains , &quot; Ziegelman noted , as cooks could hide unappetite ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which has been the focus of American cuisine for years , has become a rare luxury .
strange mixtures were tried out because a calorie @-@ rich and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy cuisine .
during her research into the book , which includes recipes , Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with peanut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch , &quot; says Coe .
Ziegelmann continues : &quot; it was surreal . &quot;
soil butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical of many of the home economics concepts .
as never before or since , household economists - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - driven the country &apos;s eating habits so much .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians &quot; and meet the challenge of turning pamping like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Meal &quot; is a festival of historical delicacies .
in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to starving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoovers &apos;s Lass @-@ me @-@ cake meal , are palatable .
while publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he fed like the millionaire man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce , &quot; Coe said .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and carried a smoking .
he was wonderfully alien to reality .
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the arrival of a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs Roosevelt led the White House to produce the boring food in Washington , but also one of the hardest prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the Great Depression era to deal with food was discarded as soon as the country was back on its feet .
the legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food , Ziegelman said , and how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of Ziegelman &apos;s mother &apos;s eating habits when writing the book - for example , how she could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; Coe said .
Ziegelman remembered : &quot; she really made people sick . &quot;
there was the windsurfing incident .
after the plates had been cleared at Eisenberg &apos;s , they and Coe produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had lunch .
&quot; it is called Prune Whip , &quot; Ziegelman said , and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a send name .
there was no cracked cream , only plum , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone appeared a little reluctantly a spoon in the tame , brown glibber .
surprisingly , it did not taste badly .
Coe made a supplementary three times .
like a Can @-@ Do Budgetiger , he said to his wife , &quot; A few hacked walnuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Aleppo
he put his own life at risk to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Aleppo : Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he risked everything to save others lives .
now even the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a Assad regime @-@ bomb attack .
Omar was a member of the White Helmets , a civil protection group that , according to the picture newspaper , has saved almost 60,000 lives .
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed houses and provide first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil protector , showing him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the rubble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of war .
as a hero , however , he never saw himself , according to the picture : &quot; for me this is the real jihad . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a martyr . &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the latest bomb attacks in Syria .
the helicopters have discarded four fassbombs over the Alzadia district , one of which was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respiratory problems .
&quot; we now eliminate the poisonous remnants of the bomb , so that children do not play with it , &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died .
the Assad regime &apos;s deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists .
Greenland shark : the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland sharks are mostly used only in winter .
this Hai was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship .
he was born in 1624 and swim with about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland sharks are only given 150 years of age .
the Greenland shark sweeps along the bottom of the North Atlantic , reaching an average of just 1,220 metres .
only when it arrives , the 5 @-@ meter long animal accelerates to a saturated 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal at this maximum speed .
however , this slow lifestyle seems to be a recipe for a long @-@ term age .
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old .
&quot; madness , &quot; comments Alexander Scheulein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life span , which represents a world record for vertebrates .
although the evolutionary biologist had long believed that Greenland haired .
there was no evidence .
Greenland sharks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitsbergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear on the surface in winter .
researchers know little about Greenland &apos;s lifestyle .
they saw their temporal speed when they placed six animals in front of Spitsbergen with a transmitter .
prey still do this sharks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had lured the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt slaughtering animals or patrol on the bottom of the icefall and seek carcasses that fall down from higher water layers .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now investigated 28 Greenland sharks , which caught fishermen off Greenland between 2010 and 2013 or Spitsbergen as by @-@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest hair was just 81 centimetres long , while the largest 502 centimetres were measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of the hair using the carbon 14 method .
this center of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the hair , the proteins contained therein are not renewed later .
the two smallest sharks had remarkably large carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
their birth was supposed to be after the early 1960 &quot; s , when nuclear weapons attempts drove larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
on the other hand , the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons tests in the 220 centimetres length of third @-@ smallest animal , so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in its 2012 investigation .
on the other hand , all major Greenland sharks had normal quantities of carbon @-@ 14 in their linchpin , resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
indeed , for a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark , the carbon footprint showed an age of 335 years , while the record shark with 502 centimetres is likely to be 392 years old .
it was known that Greenland @-@ shark females will only be raised when they are longer than four metres .
now the researchers could assign an age to the length .
as one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland &apos;s hair can obviously be reproduced at least one and a half centuries .
that , too , is likely to be a world record for vertebral animals .
it is no coincidence that such methusal systems live mainly in icy waters .
the record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland whale , in whose bacon stood at the neck of a 120 @-@ year @-@ old Harpunenspitze , was also caught in Alaska .
due to low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus .
so they mature later - and older .
in addition , in order to keep warm in the cold water , animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , which causes the animal to lose heat .
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary biologist Scheulein .
a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life .
construction ground in double pack
the Council focused on building issues at the recent meeting .
with relief , the panel welcomed the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that &quot; the marketing of recently identified residential areas can finally begin . &quot;
after the land , parcellization and construction issues have been resolved and the applications for surveying have been made , the sale of land in the residential areas of &quot; StraÃlweg &quot; and &quot; SchÃ¶nau @-@ West &quot; ( BinderstraÃe area - section 1 ) does not stand in the way of the sale to interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the farmland in the rural and quiet residential community of SchÃ¶nau addresses young families and young seniors alike .
as has been said , developers can now register in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to discuss the allocation of the parcels at its September meeting .
in order to be able to respond to requests for the establishment of other businesses , linked to job creation , the Municipal Council decided to amend the land use plan , which was drawn up only in the spring of this year .
for example , in the sub @-@ timeline area the already designated business area is extended by two parcels towards state road 2112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
as a result , competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg is the best way to attract jobs and firms relocated from London .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote , &quot; says Michael VoigtlÃ¤nder , Head of Competence for Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets at the IW .
after the Brexit referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have so far been granted authorisation in the UK .
large US banks are making use of this .
several banks have already announced the relocation of jobs .
the lobby association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , according to the IW , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which unites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the eurozone &apos;s largest banks , as well as other key authorities such as the European Insurance Supervision EIOPA and the ESRB risk correlation , is the case .
although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters in Paris , it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with supervision , &quot; says IW Professor VoigtlÃ¤nder .
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry but , like Dublin , it is worse in terms of infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to its large airport .
the city also has easy access to commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Voigtland .
on the Seine , renting first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 % higher than on the Main .
Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good health care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the Mercer management consultancy , the city ranks seven , Luxembourg ranked number 19 , Dublin ranked 33 and Paris 37 .
although quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the IW concludes .
but , despite the Brexit vote , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , the economists say .
the balance of power also speaks for this : in London , according to the figures from the Landesbank Helaba , around 144000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015 , compared to 62500 in Frankfurt .
Gilead receives legal costs from Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
a US judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by the Hepatits C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exempted from a $ 200 million compensation payment for the infringement of two patents by Merck , which related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead , after a US judge exposed a pattern of misconduct on the part of merchants , including opinion and other unethical acts .
in bringing proceedings on Thursday , US Attorney Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to deduct the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Merck tries to equate with Gilead , which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 % of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Merck complained to each other and claimed ownership of laboratory works to which Sofosbuvir is the active ingredient in Gilead &apos;s drugs .
US @-@ backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij by the Islamic State
troops supported by the US have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters left the city , said a group spokesman on Friday .
the Democratic forces of Syria ( DKS ) are now breaking through the city after the outburst of the remaining group of fighters buried inside the city .
they liberated more than 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters , and Sharfan Darwish informed Reuters of Manbij Reuters , allied with the DKS .
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are in the process of cleaning up , &quot; he told Reuters .
Clinton earns 10.75 million in 2015 and pays 34.2 % federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax declaration on Friday , which showed a $ 10.75 million income for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 % .
in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s $ 1 million donated for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $ 5.3 million in speech fees ; former Secretary of State gave $ 3 million from Simon &amp; Schuster for her book on her term in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s nominee for Vice @-@ President Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia , together with his wife Anne Holton , has published his tax declarations of the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion .
in a stark contrast , Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backtracking over his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Trump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers have indicated a tax test by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; you are on the train , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter about the publication of the Democratic presidential candidate .
on Thursday , Michael Cohen , Trump &apos;s Special Adviser , said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax audits have been completed .
Trump &apos;s critics , including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney , have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about assets , his donations to charitable organizations , his business practices , and various other ties , especially Russia .
Clinton has already grasped the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in which senior Republicans are calling on Trump to publish his tax declaration .
on Thursday she also raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; she said .
politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax during the 1990 &quot; s , and an economic journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday , saying that this may still be the case .
federal taxes have become an issue in the campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha , Nebraska , Buffett , whose home country is Berkshire Hathaway , called for Trump to meet to exchange tax returns .
Buffett said that he was also subject to an IRS tax test , and Trump was afraid of voters , not tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign published tax returns back until 2007 .
the Clintons now living in Chappaqua , New York , paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 % .
the 2015 Clinton tax declaration showed that it received only USD 100 of its income as a reward , unlike most Americans .
their main asset was a low @-@ cost index fund , from which the Clinton dividends and earnings of USD 109,000 were taxed .

condoms with Chilipuder , fireworks promote Tanzania &apos;s elephant protection
nature defenders in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into human @-@ inhabited settlements - they are throwing condoms on them filled with chilipuder .
the method has proved effective , and the Honeyguide Foundation , which had the idea of doing so years ago , has stepped up its support along with US nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvesting without infringing animals .
previously , many spears used to defend themselves .
Friday is World Telephone Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we developed the ... Toolkit , we have seen a change in attitudes within these communities , with much more confidence that they can dissuade the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants , &quot; Honeyguide Damian Bell said in a communication .
the first two steps include the illumination of the elephant with a torch and the bladder into a horn .
if he is not deterred , a so @-@ called &quot; chilicloud &quot; is thrown .
chilipuder mixes with earth together with a fireworks basket into a condom whose end is turned to the ignition .
when it is ignited , the condom bursts with a bang and spends fine dust on Chilipuder into the air .
a hat usually already out to hunt the elephant .
one last possibility is a shipyard that shoots a gold fire plant into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
municipal Council decides unanimously : no new kiosk construction at St. Goary Rheinufer
normally , the St. Goary investment projects of traders with Kusshand are accepted - after all , retailers in the core city are considered to be well developed .
however , the city council has now unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a sales centre on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine .
&quot; in principle we welcome new traders , but at this location on the banks of the Rhine , this kiosk does not fit in , &quot; said Michael Hubrath on behalf of the CDU Group .
Jewish director crushes Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uprising after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre @-@ election because it &quot; requested &quot; Arab guests according to an employee .
Claude Lanzmann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Shoah , &quot; left his anger at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ .
during his last stay Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of country selections of the hotel .
the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel rooms .
how is it possible for Israel to be eliminated and deleted in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany ?
wrote Lanzmann .
instead , Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own Call Center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received was &quot; shocked him , &quot; as Lanzmann wrote .
the hotel worker said that the measure was a &quot; deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind this caused even more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they asked for the preselection to be deleted , &quot; has been quoted by Lanzmann .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas @-@ Handelsman called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reported the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung .
we were appalled and dismayed by this event .
that is really very shameful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more disgraceful .
that does not require any explanation .
we expect the hotel to draw &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; said the official .
the incident caused quite a lot of resonance on the Internet , where people called it a scandal .
some told the Kempinski Hotel that it had &quot; succumbed &quot; to the alleged calls of Arab guests .
&quot; shame on you , &quot; it was said in another speech that pointed out that the hotel located on the prestigious KurfÃ¼rstendamm is close to a synagogue .
the hotel quickly dismissed all charges and called the incident a &quot; oversight &quot; and &quot; apologized &quot; to Lanzmann , reported The Mirror .
&quot; there has never been a direct instruction not to include Israel in the quick @-@ selection list , &quot; the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman of the Kempinski Hotel .
it adds that the country preference has now been added .
police uses tears &amp; rubber bulbs against protesting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo to demonstrate against government reforms of the public education system .
the police used tears and rubber floors against the demonstrators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart , causing the police to use rubber floors and tears .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans .
according to the proposals of the Governor of the State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin , slightly less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money .
some of the protesters saw Graffitits screwing at walls against provisional President Michel Temer .
the recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets in masses to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff , who had been abducted by a Senate vote to dismiss her .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador Levan Dzhagaryan , trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 % annually .
since international sanctions against Iran were lifted , interest on the part of Russian companies in domestic operations has grown strongly , the ambassador has told .
Russian companies take on existing links with Iran , while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
of course , further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 % in the first five months of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 and was $ 856 million .
in particular , Russian imports into Iran rose by 91.5 % and amounted to $ 697 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 % to $ 158 million .
the trade recovery was achieved through deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said Ambassador .
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , Russian representation issued some 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens , primarily travel visas .
moreover , Iran reached the top 20 in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
one might say that last year &apos;s record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time , relatively few Russians visit Iran , something the ambassador hopes will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan , Shiraz and Yazd , who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses sought : beverage market in forest fires
a predatory attack was carried out on Thursday evening on Rewe XXL &apos;s beverage market on the GerberstraÃe forest fire .
under the guise of a firearm , three dark @-@ hanged people who had mummed their faces demanded the release of cash from the beverage market &apos;s employees , and then flew first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf .
how much money has been exploited does not tell the police .
the perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters large , i.e. relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is not visible .
the perpetrators must be cleared after the attack in the direction of GerberstraÃe , Friedrich @-@ Engelbert @-@ Weg and flew from the Schotterparkplatz with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schladernring ) .
anyone who has made observations on the crime period ( at 7.45 p.m. ) related to the robbery should contact the police as a matter of urgency .
Nagold : play and Fun at Summer Free Time
eight beautiful and happy days were spent by children and adolescents of the social pedagogical daily group / social group work of the Nagold Children &apos;s Conservation League with their carers during their summer free time in Nussdorf , near MÃ¼hlacker .
in the quiet Hardtwldle recreational area , the liveliness group was quartered during the first week of school holidays .
several full day excursions were on the programme .
on the one hand it went to Bretten with the visit of the Streichelzoos .
on the other hand , after Maulbronn , where there was a special guided tour of the world famous monastery .
the third trip took us to Pforzheim .
at the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Celts .
on the hot days , the group at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn , which invited you to jump , swim and plan .
culinary delights were served to children and carers with their self @-@ prepared liquors such as the Sauren SpÃ¤Ãle , the Seebronner PfÃ¤nnle , Iselshauser @-@ Bloff , the English breakfast and TÃ¼binger BÃ¼ngnese .
in workshops , beautiful jewellery made of pearls and stones was created or a Roman mill game was made of wood .
other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , evenings at the fire and the final &quot; bunte evening . &quot;
on the day of travelling home , the sun laughed and the children and young people returned to their homes .
Haigerloch : pilgrims to the gates of mercy
the mini @-@ strants from the Eyachtal @-@ Haigerloch St. Anna were travelling on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg .
four stages have been completed together .
in order to bridge the time until the next round of Romance pilgrimage of all Ministrants in a year &apos;s time , the St. Anna Oberministrantenround has decided to prepare and conduct a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
a number of pilgrimage destinations were examined and a final decision was made for the Bishop &apos;s City of Freiburg , where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opening of the Baroque Church on the Fribourg MÃ¼nster .
16 minis from Bittelbronn , Gruol , Haigerloch and Holy Rooms were on their way .
in the evening before , parish priest Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims &apos; crosses and gave the pilgrimage &apos;s blessing .
from Horb there was a train to the starting point of Villingen , where there is also a MÃ¼nster of Our Lady of Our Lady and the pilgrimage route from MÃ¼nster .
in the morning and in the evening , the individual daily tours were accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way the Minis made Rast on field crosses , chapels or churches again and again to sing a song from specially assembled Pilger @-@ Liedheft .
for overnight stays there were pastures of the local parish churches .
at the stages Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a tasty and strong dinner and breakfast .
the second day went on to Furtwangen to GÃ¼tenbach .
after that , the stage was followed by St. Peter , who was the most demanding route , but had to go down about 500 metres of altitude at the time of the heat and then come back .
in the evening , the earned reward was a joint barbecue at the bathing pasture .
after the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , the final stage went to Freiburg .
intentionally relieved and happy , the minis arrived later in the afternoon at the Freiburger MÃ¼nster and crossed the gates of mercy .
God was thanked with a small impulse .
in the evening fair in MÃ¼nster , the Minis at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by co @-@ operative Markus Obert .
the pilgrims were able to visit the Sakristei and the High altar .
the next day there was still time for the Breisgaumetropolis .
in the afternoon it went back to Horb by train .
finally , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong Community experience were marked .
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home as Brite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Callum Skinner crashed last night in the men &apos;s team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio , when the British team defended the London title in 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had taken on board .
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago , while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place at the World Cup in London in March , despite Hoys resignation .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in good time as a hint .
Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close .
Skinner was the man she stayed with when she saw potential in the Scots that has now developed .
Hindes , Kenny - who won Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds , but the New Zealand countries won the first round in the standard races .
and the British trio won the duel with gold .
Hindes fell short after his round , but Kenny brought the team forward and skinner kept it .
a change of strategy was a major part of the transformation in which Hindes went up in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace .
hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and struck Skinner , Kenny and Hindes as they climbed to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old skinner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a flattering comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was simply incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 triumph on Kennys and Hoys side , Hindes admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally on track .
he later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England &apos;s rivals .
with such a surprising victory , there was no such problem this time .
Hindes said : &quot; it feels like London with all the GB flags . &quot;
we have met as a team over the last three months .
we have come so badly out of so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , won by seven out of ten titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in velodrom .
with the form Kennys it is possible that he repeats Hoy &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would be an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy , born on March 23 ( an apparently sacred date for British sport ; on the day Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born ) .
that would be the same as Hoy .
Kenny takes part in the sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bolton said : &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
Hindes said : &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the knight . &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bradly Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 51,942 .
the world record that won gold in London in 2012 was 3 : 51,659 .
the first and final round ( 22.42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where Wiggins will certainly focus .
yesterday he fought with representatives before qualification when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will continue and end tomorrow , Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4 : 13.260 .
the GB team relies on its strong team of railway cyclists to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and catch a char of medals .
after a truly exceptional account of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were reduced .
Dramas played in the background , such as the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sex and murder charges and the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom , it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated .
future of the merger of Portland as a result of the abolition of the energy contract
the future of Portland &apos;s aluminium meltdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers &quot; jobs - is at stake , as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus end all supply contracts , as the supplier notified .
this step follows the decision by the government in Victoria earlier this year not to grant further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
a 20 @-@ year subsidy expires in November .
up to 2000 jobs are at stake in the Alcoa plant in Portland .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
moreover , domino effects may occur , as meltdown consumes about 10 % of Victoria &apos;s total power generation .
in 2014 , Alcoa closed Point Henry , leading to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year .
Alcoa &apos;s merger in Portland is losing money and risking closure .
this step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently because of the electricity price for the plant .
AGL , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley , announced that three other owners would terminate their contracts .
the plant is mainly owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina , of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares .
&quot; AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means further physical demand for electricity through melting , &quot;
AGL continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; collateral transactions &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; therefore AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute 17 to revenue in fiscal year , &quot; said the electricity supplier .
all potential effects on AGL revenues from GJ 18 onwards are currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $ 187 million in &quot; anticipation of termination . &quot;
Alcoa said that the decision to cancel the contracts did not adversely affect the &quot; ability of Alcoas ... to operate the melting plant or to guarantee electricity supply to the melting plant . &quot;
the US company said that it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which should have entered into force from November this year , even though it is still guilty of explaining why it resigned from the Treaty .
analysts warn against the possible closure of Portland in Victoria and Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the industry &apos;s poor economic conditions .
referring to the analysts &quot; statements earlier this week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts and tomago every year about 900 megawatts of electricity .
if both plants were to disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator of electricity , that would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kardashian reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue .
Kendall Jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian @-@ Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the U.S. Vogue .
Kendall , the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this cover to the wine , &quot; Kendall wrote .
the final release of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashian similar ? ) , crippled reality video that shows the whole Kardashian @-@ Jenner family ( with the exception of the problems Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the popular Showbiz Onkelling producer .
this is the clichÃ© action almost every birthday pond of a child &apos;s show ( Seacrest put the phrase &quot; You want us to forget you ? &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon canteen on a TV station at 8 am ) , but Kris somehow had to let her other girls participate in this publicity .
with regard to the September edition of the Vogue , a new era of Kardashian has certainly begun .
Kendall &apos;s great sister Kim may have beaten her in the Vogue cover ( she and her husband Kanye West were on display in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the magazine &apos;s September edition is a league for herself .
the September issue is the most selling edition of the year for Vogue .
with a volume similar to a picture band rather than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertisers ( Laut Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the Wood 615 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years images of the magazine were leaked before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss .
in recent years , clearly , more &quot; celebrities who model &quot; than &quot; models that are celebrities &quot; were on the cover .
Oscar winner and conductor brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady Gaga had the honour .
but even if Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthroughs model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good society .
these celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good snapchat video ( even if it &apos;s all true for Jenner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Beyonce , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of lemonade .
of course , Jenner &apos;s success does not suit everyone .
with her reality TV history , Jenner &apos;s position in the fashion world has always been somewhat tense .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them &quot; the pieces of the moment . &quot;
these feelings boasted again when the message came out on the Vogue Cover with Jenners .
but the misery seems to be at the point .
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue .
in the truest sense of the word , it is a supermodel .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your founding of Estee Lauder .
they and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their paywall apps .
she sells pictures of Cindy Crawford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is on reality TV , probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children .
16 000 people a year
more than 160,000 of the country &apos;s most needy needs are rejected annually by the local authorities , while the industry is anticipating the impact of further budget cuts on already overloaded transactions .
in Queensland , three out of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence , and those who do not have funds for unjust delosions and similar - are already rejected when seeking free legal advice and legal assistance .
the municipality &apos;s legal services , which are already overstretched , are ready to make further cuts .
as of June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 % of their federal funds .
the director of Queesland James Farrell &apos;s community centres said that the latest survey of the National Association of Local Authorities revealed that thousands of people are already being dismissed every year .
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the German Government &apos;s decision to repeal it .
he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with incalculable and depressing debts , families that go through divisions , workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems , and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut funding by 30 % , meaning that thousands of people in need of help from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the Federal Attorney General and the Federal Minister of Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to immediately lift these budget cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of local authorities and their customer communities , and the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work .
Donald Trump accused of pulling weapons
new York - Donald Trump &apos;s campaign has been indicted for alleged inaction , having been told that her campaign leader for North Carolina directed a firearm to an employee in February , while they were on a jeep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent Bordini in the Charlotte Regional Court on Wednesday , a former software programmer for the campaign in that state .
Bordini indicated that he waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot;
the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right finger on the withdrawal , and rammed the race in Vincents Kniekehle , &quot; said Bordini in his charge .
after complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership , Bordini found that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip , he announced in the indictment .
&quot; weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage , &quot; Bordini said .
the indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate unleashed a revolt when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second Amendment People &quot; - firearms owners and weapons friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and judges appointed .
Trump &apos;s campaign made it clear that the media had pulled his words out of context and that he would not incite violence .
Bordini &apos;s complaint requires damages from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and Philip for injury to body and permanent seelic damage .
Trump &apos;s press spokesperson Hope Hicks was not in favour of an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
WCCB , a local news station in Charlotte , reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
no response has been given to calls from its consulting company , Innovative Consulting Services .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far conducted a controversial campaign .
the trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwerin : survey on country elections : SPD and CDU lose
the upcoming elections in the LÃ¤nder of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) show significant losses for the ruling parties SPD and CDU .
this was demonstrated by representative surveys by the INSA opinion research institute for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could run just a little further , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin .
in both LÃ¤nder , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to lead the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD dropped from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 % .
according to the poll , the party would only be close to the CDU , which could return to 23 % .
the third place is between the left and the AfD .
the left would be 19 % ( formerly 18.4 % ) , and AfD would be represented for the first time in Landtag at 19 % .
the Greens , despite slight losses of 6 % ( previously 8.7 % ) , are returning to Schweriner Landtag .
NPD and FDP would not be represented on Landtag at 3 % each .
according to the poll , the German Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) would only be 23 % ( 2011 : 28.3 % ) .
CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent .
it would be 19 % for the Greens ( 17.6 % for 2011 ) , but 15 % for the left ( 11.7 % for now ) .
the AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Deputies at 14 % .
with 5 % , the FDP could hope for a return , but the pirates would miss the entry in 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communicator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in Zeitlupe : 20 years ago Nokia Communicator entered the market .
today , the successors dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device was almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , so it was not well in hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty knowledgeable .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight megabytes , which would now be enough for about two high resolution selffies .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes .
the Nokia 9000 Communicator came into business exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet , but they are somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet .
however , 20 years ago , the Communicator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an &quot; office in the western pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could achieve a lot for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was to reach the Communicator .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , albeit slowly .
a calculator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was quite proud : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015 .
no one could predict in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then , things have changed .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the cellular phone business of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster and was finally sold and processed to Microsoft .
today the market is dominated by suppliers , all of whom came much later than Nokia .
being always online , this is today for many people everyday .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion devices were sold , of which 555 million are owned by Samsung and Apple .
worldwide sales of the equipment are about EUR 400 billion .
this includes the well @-@ being of the numerous app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has developed around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007 , when Apple &apos;s chief Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhones at the Mac World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communicator , everything easy to use by touch screen .
Apple &apos;s winning move began , and today the iPhone is the group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Blackberry , who dominated the market , had the afterthought .
she finally disappeared , Blackberry has to fight .
Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung now have the say .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; we must all learn to get rid of the smartphone , &quot; said Janina Kugel , in the Siemens Board of Directors responsible for staff .
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must guide the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction Heathrows , just as we did in London in 2012 , when we made a huge effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End .
this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local and business people near Heathrow .
for our local communities alone , we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London in 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement is too great .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will hide on the world stage .
the doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but Heathrow answers every question he has asked .
like the Olympic Games , Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not individual .
enlargement is a way of creating up to 180,000 new jobs , Â£ 211 billion in economic growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole GB .
we have a great team at Heathrow , which has implemented a Â£ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program into time and budget , from the T5 - which was elected as the world &apos;s best airport terminal for five years , to the T2 , built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequented runways .
now they are ready to deliver a third run , which is supported by Â£ 16 billion in private investment .
the 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one .
it is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .
Lord Paul DÃ¤chton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
adblock Plus , Facebook in the &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; on display blocking
for companies that make money with online advertising , one of the software manufacturers is trying to circumvent ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockages on its desktop , Adblock Plus released a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding of its ads to make it more difficult to recognize ads about which part of the page is advertising .
but Adblock announced that it found a new way to bypass the new codes .
in a Blogpost , Adblock Ben Williams &apos;s spokesman wrote that &quot; this kind of Hin and Her struggle between the timeless Open Source community and the bypasses has been underway since the invention of ad blockers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying advertisers have become for the industry .
worldwide , according to a study carried out last year by Pagefair and Adobe , around 200 million people use ad blockers ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 % of advertising revenue .
the company does not have an impact on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Instagram .
advertising on desktop PCs represents a sufficient share of revenue , so Facebook seems to be worth investing such a move .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad preference tool &quot; to give people more control over advertising targeted at them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that adblocks would be worrying about new filters , because they would block content on the site that is not advertising .
&quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook spokesman in an email message .
ad blockers are a blunt means , so instead we have focused on development tools such as ad preferences to put more control in people &apos;s hands .
Ms suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night .
the police are witnesses to the fact that , in the early hours of the morning on Thursday , a woman was killed by a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight .
a woman put herself on the streets in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; and were hit by several cars , said the police in Waadt .
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 who was overrun by several vehicles , including a lorry , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police who are asking them and any witnesses to the incident to report themselves .
an investigation was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , and Gilles Hofstetter informed the Le Tribune de Geneve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
could a collision be avoided ?
that is something the prosecutor has to decide , &quot; said Hofstetter .
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible .
in each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers would not have to assume that a pedestrian would run on the motorway in the middle of the night , as the newspaper said .
last year , a policeman of negligent killing was acquitted after she had overrun and killed a man who was near Payerne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , took the court .
the court found that the policist -- who responded to an emergency call -- went in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely exceptional and unpredictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident near Morges on Thursday should contact the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .
NASA Climate Model : Venus was once habitable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once habitable .
scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus , with its hot , water @-@ free surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere , could once have shown earth @-@ like conditions .
scientists previously suggested that the slow change of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere , and that it was slowly moving forward .
the model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical variability to house lives and protect against rapid evaporation .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 % matt .
&quot; in the Giss model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained Giss Scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release .
this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which looks like a rain umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers .
although it was probably habitable , the Venus -- over several billion years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light .
their oceans darkened and their water vapour was burnt away from ultraviolet light .
when their hydrogen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a lethal greenhouse effect remained - the Venus that we know today .
researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters .
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche and cited too little participation in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately seek a new trainer .
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said Roy , 50 years old .
during the summer I thought long and long about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , this it needs and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
he must also have a right of participation in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not being met at the moment .
Sakic , who launched Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thanked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sakic .
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the league &apos;s best coach for the Avalanches 2013 @-@ 14 during his debut season .
he led the club to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Playoffs of Minnesota and missed the post @-@ season in each of the last two years .
the Avalanches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell five points behind the game for a second Wildcard Spot in the Western Conference .
when Hall of Fame Torwart won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche .
Northern eseeedics resume talks , suspend strike
labor struggles over pay for North Sea workers are suspended , while all the parties to the dispute are standing up for a new round of talks , said negotiators .
strikes against Wood Group , the oil field service provider , were carried out sporadically on North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to reopen the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; says a joint statement .
we will hold some full @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks which will start early next year to address the problems .
trade unions said that their last strike , the first in more than 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 % .
this year Wood Group cut rates to its North Sea counterparties by around 9 % due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s reduction follows a 10 % reduction for onshore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn .
shell has laid off thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it rationalises its activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the UK energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was exacerbated by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with workers &apos; leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest industrial disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just few , &quot; he said .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion over the last five years .
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the stellar clusters of the Plejads
the latest mission with the Kepler Space telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the Plejads .
the new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate to different rates in the star clusters and in what context the rotation periods are linked to the planetary creation .
&quot; we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age , and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Luisa Rebull , a scientist at Caltech &apos;s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena , in a press release .
the archaeological site of the Plejaden lies 445 light years from Earth .
many stars in this clubhouse , created around 125 million years ago , now reach adulthood .
you are now turning quickly .
at peak rotational rates , these mature stars emit large amounts of stars .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a dampening effect on the stars .
when an asterisk is ageing , its rotation rate begins to slow .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star , such as sunshades .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars .
Rebull compares the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Plejaden we see that slow Rotors tend to be more massive , whereas faster Rotors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Rebull said .
as the star clusters of the Plejads are so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the star clusters of Plejaden offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Rebull .
there is still a lot to be learned about , such as how , when , and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the reddening rates of Plejaden , which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal .
a controversial baseball star disappears
the tears were at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional resignation announcement , on August 12 , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional against the Tampa Bay Rays will wear the triangle of his New York Yankees .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goodbye &apos; to both , &quot; said the 14 @-@ minute All @-@ Star Game participant of the Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .
in 2009 , Rodriguez won the World Series with the Yankees .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract earned him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will become an adviser and youth coach - with full pay .
when players paid back Rodriguez for a long time .
with 696 homeruns , 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; Runs &quot; ) for the Seattle Mariners ( 1994 @-@ 2000 ) , the Texas Rangers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 he has made some milestones .
with Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays , only two more baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old may not be admitted to the baseball &apos;s fame hall .
for so successful Rodriguez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place .
as early as 2009 , the superstar at &quot; ESPN &quot; admitted having taken away prohibited steroids between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was imprisoned for 211 matches due to the involvement of the so @-@ called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014 .
Rodriguez is considered to have received funding for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a dispute the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; the League could even have done me a favour for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without pause , &quot; said Rodriguez at the time .
his days of farewell are not silent either .
while many baseball legends have once again got the big stage in their last games , Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win each game , &quot; said Yankees @-@ Coach Joe Girardi .
after all , Rodriguez , who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and who is told about the relationship with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , received sympathy from fans of Yankee Archrival Boston Red Sox .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; the followers sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team .
Olympia 2016 : Chen Xinyi , Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
learn : due to a positive doping test , the weight theber Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases .
a knowledgeable athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official doping cases became known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish thunderstorm Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - just before the start of the already critically angry athletics competitions , these news come at an intime .
last Sunday in Chen , the diuretic hydrochlorothiazid was detected , which is used as a masking agent for doping substances .
the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had won the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly , only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Chen should have taken part in the talks over 50 m Freistil .
Chen has asked the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) to open the B sample and to have a hearing .
the National Association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations , &quot; said Xinhua in a Communication : &quot; we will work with the International Sports Court ( CAS ) and will accept the judgment . &quot;
for the first time in history , the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctions against athletes with positive cases .
also on the night of Rio , the news about the positive sample at Danekowa was sickened by 33 @-@ year @-@ olds themselves .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel BNT .
she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance is EPO .
Danekowa was temporarily suspended , according to BNT , the B @-@ Probe was already positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete .
&quot; I do not understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; We Bulgarians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all thieves from the chronically doping @-@ prone nation may not participate in Rio .
on Friday the case of Adrian Zielinski was also known , the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was tested positively for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier as his brother Tomasz .
both contend for the purchase , but they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before the athlete starts , the Danekowa case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IAAF World Federation had banned the entire Russian team from taking off with the exception of systematic doping , and Kenya has also produced many bad news in Rio .
in swimming sports , the earlier offences in China also caused intense clashes between athletes .
for example , the Frenchman Camille Lacourt harshly attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang .
&quot; sun Yang pinkelt lila . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Freistil , I want to hand over , &quot; said Lacourt on French radio .
sun was also the focus of a discussion with the Australian Mack Horton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters , &quot; he said .
sun had been tested positively at China &apos;s championships in 2014 for the Trimetazidin stimulation , but had to sit down for a three @-@ month lock .
data Dog : so perfide blackmail hackers
developers of blackmail malware currently target companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey of malware defence specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America , the United Kingdom and Germany , 40 % of the companies surveyed have been at least once , in part several times , victims of an attack with Erpresser software .
in Germany , almost 20 % of companies were already the target of ransomware blackmail .
40 % of the victims willingly paid the lion &apos;s money requested by the perpetrators in order to be able to reuse the systems and data that were attacked .
according to Malwarebytes &quot; observations , the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks on corporate networks .
if they are successful , the potentially extortionating lion &apos;s money will be much higher than private users .
&quot; we are currently seeing a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in talks with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 , most malware programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the shift to company attacks has been made terribly fast in recent months .
Ransomware works on a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it looks specifically for recently modified files such as Word , Excel or database files , and archives of images and videos .
these files encrypt the Ransomware and permanently delete the originals .
afterwards , the software presents the demands of the blackmail .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin .
however , where private users are at stake in the personal photo database , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production will stop .
accordingly , the damage is higher if a Ransomware strikes .
22 % of German companies concerned reported sales losses due to Ransomware , 13 % had to interrupt business completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; we always say to the victims : does not pay , it only promotes the problem , &quot; says Kleczynski .
but 80 @-@ 90 % of companies that pay get their data back .
managers find it difficult to reject the perpetrators &quot; demands in the face of deadlock in operation .
hackers , in turn , know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure security researchers have examined user areas and contact with the blacksmiths and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to collect more money .
they explain to their victims via chat how to pay via Bitcoin , set up or decrypt free support websites .
and when private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data back unencrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free profits from ransomware blackmail , hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work , says security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos : &quot; a single person can write a ransomware about a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four people .
the programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software module to the actual blackmail .
the previous malware kits were created by buying the malware themselves , advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; included in the package is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and branding can be changed , &quot; says Wisniewski .
the blacksmiths then look for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so you log into one of the forums in the underground , buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per computer .
&quot; usually the criminals then commission spammers to spread , &quot; explains Wisniewski .
the risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that are better able to protect their data .
more than 50 % of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust in being able to resist Ransomware using file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful retrieval , the perpetrators risk publishing sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski .
this makes the damage potential much higher than before depending on the type of data .
in future , the perpetrators could also put completely new targets on the Internet of Things .
at the Hacker Conference Defcon , security researchers demonstrated how to control a thermostat connected to the Internet .
in the middle of winter the activation of such a blocked heating may well be worth a ransom .
if the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ransomware could also become an issue in the industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and customizable
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupÃ© and also the versatility of a minivan .
sounds rather overloaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz , is really very flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.60 m high , passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work closely at all .
the interior materials are well processed and have a pleasant effect . only the cockpit upper side falls slightly .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than similar vehicles in the storage room .
not only is there a boot of 453 l available for elevated and 1026 l for wrapped backrest , but there are the Magic Seats .
this is less magical than it sounds : the rear bench seats can be mounted like a kettle and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the ground to the ceiling .
the boot can be loaded well , but the loading height at 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
but he is likely to do his job a little quieter .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another motorization : a 1.5 l petrol tank with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamism and comfort .
however , steering should be a little more direct .
the equipment does not leave any wishes open in the tested top version &quot; Executive . &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency brake wizard ( working up to Tempo 32 ) , the collision warning system and the gauge support .
the collision warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote light wizard works very reliably .
and the intelligent tempo controller responds to the traffic mark recognition and reduces the speed if necessary .
the full connectivity is available only for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touchscreen , Navi , app integration and more .
two USB- and HDMI @-@ booths are under the armrest and can therefore be easily reached .
the approximately 29000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 20000 euros and diesel from 23000 euros .
the engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Airline is not liable : overturning passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the loss of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
for liability is only possible in the event of risks typical of air traffic , the Oberlandesgericht DÃ¼sseldorf ( Az . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued .
the plaintiff had broken a knee gun in the fall .
but the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk to life , according to the Court .
the airline did not have to pay compensation to the man .
disease case : when does the organiser pay
only when the cause of the disease is unquestionably found in the hotel will ill holidaymakers get money back after their journey .
however , this is only the case if more than 10 % of guests have shown the same symptoms .
in the negotiated case , a family was severely ill with diarrhea and burglary on the second day of their Turkish holiday .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness resulted in a defective treatment plant , allegedly polluting marine water .
the family believed that the journey was flawed - and complained against the organizer .
the plaintiff had no success in court .
the treatment plant was indeed defective .
however , the organiser only learned about this shortly before the plaintiff &apos;s departure .
until then , he had to assume that the sea water was in order .
consequently , he did not breach his obligations to provide information ,
since no contamination was found in the samples of water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly through infection among themselves - is a general risk to life .
of 691 guests , only 38 were ill .
de MaiziÃ¨re said that after the violence committed by refugees in WÃ¼rzburg and Ansbach in July , many people were concerned about further attacks .
the state must respond with determination to terrorist threats .
what is certain is that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division .
we will not be able to succeed in this .
if criminals had to leave the country more quickly , however , this would increase the security and strength of the population &apos;s support for refugee policy .
de MaiziÃ¨re intends to implement the proposals by the 2017 federal elections .
he also announced a further increase in the number of security forces , &quot; on average four times over several years . &quot;
sympathetic advertising of terrorism must be punished again .
video surveillance should be improved , arms law revised to make it more difficult to buy weapons on the Internet .
according to de MaiziÃ¨res , the most recently discussed duty of secrecy for doctors is to be preserved .
however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions to reduce the vulnerability of citizens , for example , with regard to mental disorders .
in order to counter the radicalisation of refugees , the Minister believes that better social care is needed .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people .
de MaiziÃ¨re plans to use covert investigators to prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet .
SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister for the Interior has clearly opposed activism .
&quot; this was a celebration for the drummer in the CDU / CSU , &quot; said Gabriel to the radio media group newspapers ( Friday ) .
de MaiziÃ¨re had previously rejected calls from the Union for a ban on Burka and the abolition of double nationality .
a general ban on full disguise is a constitutional problem .
it is not possible to ban everything that is rejected and I reject the use of the burqa .
it is possible to talk about rules on road transport or witnesses in court .
Greens @-@ chief Simone Peter accused the Minister of wanting to simulate action and action with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror packages .
left @-@ wing Party leader Bernd Riexinger said : &quot; fleet sprayers and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people of that country . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
there is regular dust on the bypass - here is a picture of November .
but this is to change : the legal service provider should be renewed .
this is good news for all car drivers who are on the road every night when driving over the motorway ( A 43 ) .
the state @-@ owned road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer StraÃe and Weseler StraÃe exit by 700 meters .
drivers can then turn right directly from Hammer StraÃe .
the big advantage is that traffic is spread at an early stage , improving the overall process on the much @-@ travelled section of the Bundesstrasse 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had been presented by the CDU Group in the district representation MÃ¼nster @-@ West .
car drivers are particularly nervous between 17 and 19 : 00 .
on weekdays , the back stau reaches the bridge over the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle clock on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler StraÃe .
from here , traffic is only passing through the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt well over three quarters years ago .
the reason for this is that static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the necessary capacity to absorb heavy goods traffic twice .
how long this bottleneck and the associated daily congestion will last , cannot be said by the competent local company .
however , years can be expected : the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 2034 .
for the extension of the legal service provider , the state @-@ owned company deliberately chose the weaker time in school holidays because there are obstacles .
the traffic is passing by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural tour : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Forest School visited the play &quot; Das unsichtliche Haus . &quot;
the association NIMA &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
NIMA &apos;s association enables young people with a migrant and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in MÃ¼nster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the Young Theater MÃ¼nster .
in the context of the &quot; Intercultural Tour &quot; initiated by NIMA &apos;s association , 19 students between 11 and 15 visited the staging in the small house .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with a migrant and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in MÃ¼nster as part of this project .
most of the class &apos;s young people came to MÃ¼nster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia , and Syria .
thanks to the choreographies , the Scene images and video animations , they could still follow the course of action , according to the press release of the Young Theater MÃ¼nster .
the association NIMA &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming time as part of a music theme project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years should be given the opportunity to attend professionally conducted courses in the fields of singing , dance , spectacle and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatre language teaching are planned .
the Intercultural Tour project continues .
given the increase in the number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rainfall instead of starvation : hope for weather improvement
the weather has put a stop to the stars in the southwest of Germany at night to Friday - but there is still hope .
the night had been bad for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , said the chairman of the World War II , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on Saturday night .
the weather should be good , then we will certainly see many stars in the sky .
stars are pearls , which , at 216000 kilometres per hour , are among the fastest stars .
they have their names because they seem to come from the asterisk of Perseus , which rises in the northeast .
restful Night : tips on sleep disorders
in the evening you walk eternally , at night you are waking up for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think of sleep well before the wrestling .
that is far from recovering .
after all , such problems are in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than 10 % feel that their sleep is often or permanently unrecoverable .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders arise ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and they can be based on a variety of causes , says Hans @-@ GÃ¼nter WeeÃ , member of the Executive Board of the German Society for Schlafforschung and Sleep Medicine .
however , what one understands by land is the insomnia , that is to say an intrusion and spill .
this is precisely what many people feel is unsatisfactory or insufficient , says Jens Wagenknecht , member of the Board of Directors of the German House Medical Association , with practice in Varel , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
this can be based on organic , psychological or behavioral factors , but also on medicines .
often , sleep disturbance is an expression of another disease .
&quot; very early awakening is especially common in a depression , &quot; says WeeÃ .
and it may be that different factors are interdependent .
for example , if you have a tape discard , you can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours , and perhaps start to shake about everyday problems and concerns , you &apos;ll find your way .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights per week and who are affected by the day should go to the doctor , advise WeeÃ .
the impairment may look very different : one is locked , tired , unloaded , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is slightly irritable , has mood fluctuations or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
to relieve sleep disturbances , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavioural changes , cognitive behavioural therapy , or even drugs - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks .
established sleeping mediators hardly exist in Germany , emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietzen , head of the interdisciplinary slaughterhouse of the CharitÃ© UniversitÃ¤t Medizin Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleep problems , you should first contact the doctor , advise WeeÃ .
it can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the sleeping laboratory and what happens ?
for example , medical doctors recommend using snoring with respiratory agents , with sickening daily fatigue , sleeping transmitters , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a breakdown , Fietzen explains .
it is not really necessary to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; just don &apos;t take lunch sleep , &quot; says Fietze .
after strolling , you go to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , you carry a nose glasses , a breast belt and a fan on your finger .
moreover , a camera on the ceiling captures the sleeping ends .
how can people get to grips with the problems ?
there are quite a lot of position screws on which you can start a better sleep .
it is important to note that regular sleep and rest periods , not too long in bed , do not sleep in the day , do not watch TV to sleep , avoid alcohol and watch out for the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately , and that is completely unhelpful .
what is the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming ?
former German swimmer Markus Deibler commented on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis via Facebook .
in December 2014 , he first collected gold at the World Short @-@ Snow Championships in Doha , while also putting up his first world record .
now the former DSV @-@ Athlet Markus Deibler on Facebook protected himself from his ex @-@ team colleagues who were criticised .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 â¬ award and a jungle King 150,000 â¬ should no one be surprised by missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page .
the support system for swimming sports is bad , but doping controls are very good .
this will not enable us to compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely or even operate on the issue of doping .
&quot; I am not saying that controls should be stopped here , &quot; he added .
if he wanted to start a comeback , Deibler would have to be notified nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( NADA ) .
that is what we should keep with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled by independent WADA / FINA inspectors for some time before the World Cup / OS may not participate , &quot; calls for the election Hamburg , which is now running an ice cream line .
airport : bandage of baggage allowances arrested
professional thieves at DÃ¼sseldorf Airport
on Thursday the police in DÃ¼sseldorf succeeded in arresting two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the suspects had committed several pocket and baggage seals as a gang .
at 9.30 p.m. , civilian officials in DÃ¼sseldorf airport rediscovered a gang known to the police from past theft crimes .
the two women and two men had committed several offences since mid @-@ July of this year , acting collectively , in a spirit of work and particularly professionally .
the specialists of the Crime Commissioner 34 can demonstrate four acts to the detainees who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes .
they had exploited more than 15,000 euros .
old buildings , a few left @-@ wing trees , in the middle , still a few headquarters : Rigaer StraÃe in Berlin @-@ Friedrichshain does not work at first glance , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you walk from the east to the west , you will pass by playgrounds , a freshly cut kindergarten and a biolade .
someone sprayed on the facade of a grey house .
compared to a lidl , which is soon to be demolished , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017 .
however , articles about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it , are mainly illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks .
the reason is the house number 94 : once occupied , residents now have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin interior senator Henkel , in particular , has repeatedly argued in favour of a police crackdown on the project , calling the area &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for police officers and 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence .
after , on 22 June , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kadterschmiede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , the police patrolled official statements for three weeks , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground , blocked parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
in the meantime the rooms were renovated on behalf of the unknown owners .
on July 13 , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the evacuation had been illegal , and one day later police and construction workers withdrew under the anguish of sympathizers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street works peacefully : parents walk with children , people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about spÃ¤ti .
there is a primary school and kindergarten nearby .
left @-@ wing violence is not the main concern of many residents : Kerstin Neugebauer , who has been living in Kiev since 1999 , and Jana * , who is raising three children here , are above all generalized by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern about increasing rent and genetic modification .
it does not sound like a jaw that the majority wanted to secure police protection from vandalizing left .
the tomb that the Berlin interior senator and the police set up between house leaders and their neighbors does not seem to exist .
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working district , which still has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city .
in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Mainz street near Rigaer .
while Mainz had been cleared in a real street battle under a large police force , many of the Rigaer projects were legalised and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and election connoisseurs from all over the world : with them , residents of the GDR and former house occupiers now share their pines .
this can also be seen in the case of renting , which since 2009 has increased by almost 60 % for new renting .
many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols of this development : they are recognized by shelves or newly cut facades , which have been beaten with colours .
no other road has been mentioned so often this year , along with the words &apos; left @-@ wing violence &apos; .
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as personal injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against policemen .
most of the crimes are damage to property , which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Kerstin Neugebauer , who has been living in a rental house for 17 years next to the controversial 94 , there can be no question of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is reassuring : the people of 94 are their neighbours , who have certainly not been .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here you help each other , live together on the street and get more with each other than anywhere else . &quot;
Neugebauer has consciously moved to Rigaer StraÃe - and remained .
that is why it was so important for the residents to get back to their streets : the police , the politics and the media , all of which suddenly claimed the power of interpretation over the district in July .
but , in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer , the road continues to be taken away from them : by reckless new buildings in former building blocks , which drive away the old inhabitants .
&quot; after all , these are real estate properties that are not of interest to many here - here people who are not so well looked after live , &quot; she says .
&quot; I absolutely cannot endorse violence and destruction . &quot;
but what should we do if someone never hears ?
there is frustration on all sides , including the police and the residents .
Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for zugezogenes who are annoyed by colour bombs : the house projects and the left scene were part of the jaw .
if you are travelling , you should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a pub area can complain badly about noise .

Urbach : Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organisation .
she is also a local social worker .
since July , Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach .
the Social Pedagogist supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger .
it sees itself as a contact point for all actors : refugees , refugee workers , administration , authorities and anyone else .
Regine customer of the working group suggests that honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is now here , the icing Wollmilchsau , which has a particular problem .
for example , some - rather than appeasing but targeting the multitude of tasks - meant that the administration wanted to publish the post .
an administrative specialist was sought with a talent for languages and people , together with a long experience in the field of social work , just an illuminating Wollmilchsau .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Annika Deuschle .
above all , it is about organisation , working with local people and also behind the scenes and networking activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been present for about six weeks .
it has a 50 % share for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and principal players .
there are major and small problems , organisational , human and contractual problems .
new containers will soon be on WasenstraÃe
it has been a serious problem for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees that have been recognised .
local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate refugees in their own or rented homes .
the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
responsibility varies from country council to community and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
in fact , the administration does not find private housing .
so far , it has not worked , but it depends on private apartments , says Deuschle .
therefore , communal housing must be seized , as it is so beautiful .
so new containers will soon be installed in WasenstraÃe .
but only apartments are not enough .
perspective is the keyword , Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree .
in addition to permanent jobs , they are traineeships , training places , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants who need to be frozen or set up .
&quot; more seats would be good , &quot; says Regine customer .
many work in the Bauhof or help house managers , do non @-@ profit work - and that is motivated and very orderly , as Annika Deuschle reports .
it hopes that work for the community will have a positive external impact .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
however , activity is not just work .
the day needs a fixed structure , say Deuschle and customer .
people should develop a sense of belonging .
so there is a need for sports , contacts with locals and , above all , language courses .
professional courses are rar .
so here too , administration and honorary officials are involved .
it is central that refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of proceedings is a problem .
they must explain to refugees that it takes time and that they can reasonably bridge the gap , for example with language courses .
anyone who at some point feels that he can help no one in Urbach should not work , and that he will never integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
however , there are also problems , customers say honestly , &quot; people who don &apos;t work at all . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mammoth task . &quot;
a difficult question : are the two , following recent events , afraid of radicalisation , including in a small community like Urbach ?
&quot; no , &quot; Regine customer says very clearly , &quot; what some might call naÃ¯ve . &quot; a residual risk could and would not exclude it .
but the helpers are already aware .
these incidents were also the subject of refugees .
they would fear that the attackers would completely discredit them .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with this , &quot; says Regine customer .
many would like to stay in Urbach .
so primary and honorary officials on the ground and in the region must look for activities .
they always have a background in which a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach .
does Germany need a ceiling ?
to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid .
in fact , it is unfair to put them on the ground .
&quot; we have not yet arrived in Urbach where we want to go , &quot; says Annika Deuschle .
no new refugees , that would ease the situation .
Regine customer also makes it clear that Urbacher is already using it to integrate the existing people properly .
these are currently about 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must be helped , both women agree .
the political world is so complicated , there are no easy answers .
Schorndorf : single @-@ crusher looking for helicopters
the police helicopter fled various areas for about an hour - without success .
two unknown men entered an apartment in a multi @-@ family house at 8.50 am on Friday morning .
the resident surprised the two and struck the unwooded .
the two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters large , well masked , wearing both Bluejeans and black capsules .
they fled to the city centre .
the police used several strikes as well as a police helicopter .
the search was unsuccessful .
perhaps the unknown occurred near the apartment or on their flight .
Baden @-@ WÃ¼rttemberg : police investigate Rocker attack on snacks
following an attack on an Ulmer snack , the police are investigating six suspects from the Rockermilieu for serious land peace slumps .
in case of housing searches , evidence and narcotics had been secured , the police announced on Friday .
some 20 masked men of a rocker @-@ like group had thrown bottles and stones against a snack in July , according to police .
they were then attacked by two guests and slightly injured .
they then fled .
at the snack and the adjacent building there was damage of EUR 10000 .
according to the investigators , there is a dispute in the Ulmer Rockermilieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish course .
