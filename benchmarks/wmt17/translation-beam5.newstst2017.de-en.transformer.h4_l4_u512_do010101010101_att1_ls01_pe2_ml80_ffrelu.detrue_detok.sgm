<seg id="2">A 28-year-old cook recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="3">The victim's brother said that he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm him, "Finally, he went uphill."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Leichnam, found on Wednesday morning in Westfield Mall, was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="5">The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and that the investigation is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told the ABS channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who worked as a cook in Boston, had raised his dream job six months ago as a cook in the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="7">A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss it painfully," said the speaker.</seg>
<seg id="9">Our thoughts and condolences are with Franks family and friends at this difficult time.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louis Galicia indicated that Frank first lived in hostels, but that "things finally went up for him."</seg>
<seg id="11">"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.</seg>
<seg id="12">Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was a friendly man with a great heart.</seg>
<seg id="14">His way to connect with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us for dinner, "said Louis Galicia.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was the brother who swam with the current.</seg>
<seg id="17">"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this unveiled diamond that lit brightly every day," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD reference phone at 415-575-4444.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jennifer Aniston does not always have to be perfect or successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Hollywood star has now made this clear in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I am always put in drawers or glued from outside labels, which usually have little to do with me and reality."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I myself do not want to be always perfect and successful."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Frankly, these things are rather bad for me."</seg>
<seg id="7">Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect," as she says in the current "Cosmopolitan."</seg>
<seg id="8">After all, the actress likes to spend her time at home, on the front television with a light dutt and Mexican food, says the magazine.</seg>
<seg id="9">As far as white glut is concerned, they ask the question of the child's desire: "We women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," says Hollywood star.</seg>
<seg id="10">In her new film "Mother's Day - love is not a child's play" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.</seg>

<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experience on the horse is manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking with some colleagues for a bit of variety with an excursion on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chio: "Golden pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays, they hunted home to the fodder drums in the fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">A kilometre at this rate, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the riding cart ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was guided with his family over the facility of the ALRV, and he did not even jump to a horse for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid gave the man from Anhausen the Golden Sports Pyramid as part of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no shortage of awards for the friendly athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverarbeitskreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen loved him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The eighteenth winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first winner Hans GÃ¼nter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"This award means a lot to me," Langer says, "because it is awarded not only for sporting successes but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting young people for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he gave the prize money of EUR 25,000.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-fold US master saver was admitted to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">These include the Leichtathleten Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechel Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wienka.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious society moved to the Springstadion where the Lavazza Prize ran.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept away from the big animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump's Economic Policy Settlement: It's All about the Money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want that.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are divided on tax and energy policy and on a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical, difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, Trump claims.</seg>
<seg id="9">He would greatly reduce regulations, and he would argue for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, that it has disadvantaged opportunities and that it needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes on the rich would be increased, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">They need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost exactly the same.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies, and are strongly opposed, say, by Republicans "statesmanship wing.</seg>
<seg id="16">So Trump could have internal party discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and get coal back into the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas and the Paris climate agreement will be terminated.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energies with her investment program and demands that "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in terms of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, do not want to sign either.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, they do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they simply want to protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">For example, Clinton is calling for them to be paid better.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 was a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: Once he says: The minimum wage must rise, he says that he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the major debate over the coming months is likely to be more about the fiscal policies of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, there is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics claim that this would only add to the budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least to ask the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "Every fleeing woman has experience of sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is almost everyday for women fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Everyone has a baby with a maximum age of one year.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks with great eyes curious into the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother sticks on the table.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is Managing Director of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with women fleeing.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen have fled.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodation facilities for women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs set up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's assistance.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was recently officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - even as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It is not exaggerated to say that every woman who comes here has had experience of sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a source of hope," she says.</seg>
<seg id="24">For women, there are other reasons for escaping: "Many steal secretly because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is continuing.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is continuing to escape.</seg>
<seg id="28">"That smugglers, for example, demand sexual action for a bottle of water is not rare," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believes that when they arrive in Germany, the end tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here, too, single women in refugee accommodation would often be considered inferior and, at worst, abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">As a result, about 90% of women living in accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">Because they often don't know how to help, it needs more accommodation only for them, calls Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for accommodating refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">Some say no to the question of whether they know about a project similar to that in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben, women who are alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Unter- und Mittelfranken there are floors or own houses for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be kept separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the committee, it says: 'It is very important that men and women are kept separately'.</seg>
<seg id="45">"If there is a lack of privacy or if men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can occur - continuously."</seg>
<seg id="46">In particular, the washing rooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, the study states.</seg>
<seg id="47">The extent to which women feel this need for protection can be read in the sense that there is in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"We have had a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily open a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputies of assistant doctors have called on their trade union to approve new industrial action in their disputes over a new treaty.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for the full advice of the Council to approve more work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had failed to respond to concerns about the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC Chairman Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "persistent calm" on issues, which led to the Treaty being rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board voted to completely reject the proposed new treaty and called for official renegotiations on all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating industrial action, which begins in early September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes led to the six-fold strike by assists this year, the first total shortfalls in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dr. Johann Malawana, head of the BMA assistant physician, resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of contract recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">He informed BMA members during the meetings held before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: An "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated St. Petersburg Palace Hall, I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile had a shabby effect, and he had little warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - five times, according to a report.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre-crisis level, but would even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper said that Erdogan would have behaved as if nothing had happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed to me to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a strong, sustained cooling that Putin sparked showed that Russia's leader had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: Turkey's closure of a Russian fighter gun on the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was cloudy.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared out, accusing Ankara of falling back on Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the veto will be difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, state-controlled media carried out a violent, unfettered attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time, it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it is time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could claim some sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs, first and foremost, all the friends he can get after he was abducted in a failed coup d'Ã©tat last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has fallen by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be made easier if flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti put it as follows: 'Tourists there long, tomatoes here long'.</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West, considering its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">What is more, the persistent resentment of the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray, as an analyst once described, an "alliance of outsiders": Two countries that feel offended and badly treated by the West and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It may be significant that, after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents declared at the press conference that they had not even drawn up the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But, after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot down Russia's combat jet - it is certainly better for the two leaders to talk to each other at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the Bank's Chief Executive Officer, RBS will be reduced to a backoffice role.</seg>
<seg id="3">Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that RBS was linked to the Bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since then, the Bank has distanced itself when it had to be almost collapsed and saved eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">During this period, trademark strategists "RBS" have used to protect other end-user financial brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now it has decided to focus more national brands.</seg>
<seg id="9">Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RSB references, decentralised headquarters and stock exchange listing will change to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will become more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say now that we are not pursuing global objectives but local objectives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is time for us to become the bank of brands, because how do we focus on making it a better bank for customers?" Said the CEO.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think we will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can re-launch these brands, so I think the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dettori spends Champagner after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000t profit</seg>
<seg id="3">The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He put on predilection, trained by John Gosden, a milestone on his local race track with his second win of the night.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">The three-man winner, Dettori, who won on Ghayar before, said: "It is something special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I am very emotional because my family is here too.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is not a big meeting, it is not Royal Ascot - it is a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am relieved and very modest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori takes up the rebuke when he wins on predilection</seg>
<seg id="13">Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-man Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, the nine-man Derbysieger had 4,493 career wins</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it is no surprise that he has achieved this milestone, which few have achieved before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma has been a fan of this sport for years.</seg>
<seg id="18">I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already earned 6,000 profits if he were not just a weekend and big tournament jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has won almost 30 years in GB, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but he is also an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From Flying finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British Flying Port for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was nervous.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole series of large-scale tournaments, including his famous "goblins" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an aircraft crash and received a drug ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago, he had difficulty at the beginning when he returned from his six-month blockade, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to resist his doubts and return to his best form.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he is far from the end - Dettori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his 50.th year of life.</seg>

<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a Kremlin opinion, Putin has ordered, without giving reasons, "Ivanov's dismissal from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."</seg>

<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as Head of State on draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin informed the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This move has mysteriously upset Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Putin's closest confidants and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at their own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But, despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is there a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once acclaimed as a potential president would want to steer Russian environmental policy at once - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you, in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to entrust me with this very complicated post - one might almost say - for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990 "s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was previously assumed that, after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as Putin's third term would have violated the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Â£1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected Queensferry Crossings "northern deck to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closures of the "coverings" approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 milling ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Â£1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economic Minister Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses to an engineering scandal of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used solely for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge bridge is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge is in their place and the last section of the deck is now given a concrete shot for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be raised on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented high and low-rise construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">Following the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North Tower deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or south side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive but very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be moved up at an elevation of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate because the tolerances on which the team is working were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres.</seg>
<seg id="20">Fortunately, everything went very well.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be made much more responsible in future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap homes in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">At the next Council meeting, the SPD proposes a "Living Towards" approach.</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, the question is: Who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">There has been no regulation.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We are in agreement with the Greens: Anyone who wants to build on urban areas will have to designate 20% of all housing as social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">The low-cost apartments can also be built in stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the big point of contention in the town hall is, Bratmann said: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"We want investors in such areas to build at least 10%, but as much as 20% of housing as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and will have to be financed, will provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, Bratmann said, "There is no agreement between the political groups at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="14">CDU wants to make as few rules as possible for investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, Bratmann said, the situation in the housing market is intensifying.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will create additional tasks for the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not complete: The 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do we offset the loss of another 1300 low-cost housing, which will expire over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning spokesperson Nicole Palm said, the city should now buy outgoing bonds.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, consideration should be given to bringing housing back into fixed prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the West City, deadlines expire at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price fixing for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">But that is what the owners, the housing companies, do not want.</seg>
<seg id="30">In fact, if the number of social housing in the West City is increased dramatically, you are moving away from the so-called mixing target.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of vulnerable people in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect there to be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Group Chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be on board."</seg>
<seg id="34">They concentrated on more buildings for single-family houses.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean is that a compromise cannot be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">PokÃ©mon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see the world changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">Many people have complained that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and most recently to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer, of course, to the PokÃ©mon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-offs were created).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sank interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market entry in other countries has been delayed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days PokÃ©mon Go had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go out with their smartphones and look for pokÃ©mons that are followed with a GPS and can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured" once they have been found.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when it was younger joined the ballot and jumped out of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person departs every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently informed Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53%.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing PokÃ©mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public health awareness campaigns that people want to "take 30 minutes," "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" came to deaf ears because many public messages on health are boring and come from people who look elastic.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly drive sport reduce their chances of cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of PokÃ©mon Go is that it causes people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">So three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships in hunting.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also Muslim players who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is to be done?</seg>
<seg id="27">There has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to practice sport, as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use will decline over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with action in the real world, helping many people to be more active, more fit and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Simone Biles creates gold in women's tournaments</seg>
<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all this.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumper.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the bar.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">The hotel was very clean and comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now, finally, Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnastics tossed the gap between themselves and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and Final Five team cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American woman Simone Biles is touring on the Swedish bar during the single women's multi-campaign event at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-combat title and, overall, the fifth, while consolidating her reputation for being the best of her generation, or even the best of her generation.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport over the last three years, won 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Baton said of her that she was "the best gymnastics I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between the picture and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning to the Spring family in Texas with a handful of gold would be a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the women's single multi-campaign event at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell ceremony she served as an exclamation mark for the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during her long journey to the top, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Some of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - are tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school flight to the gymnasium where Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost a multi-fight competition, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swebebebebebalken und Bodenturnen - in which Biles holds the World Cup title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She rebounded with 15.433 on the Sweet Bar - setting up a 15.933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman gently impoverished her when she expected her final glow - a pure formality - and tears flown on Biles shining red, white and blue elders when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground practice she threw KusshÃ¤nde to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as the picture is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, killed in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first series murderer, while they were in the car and listening to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">The authorities said: "</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the front-passenger side of the car and then flew with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police announced that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2.900 held by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard, the police spokesman, said that the shooting led the investigators to see if it was associated with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed and two injured in nine attacks within four months, mainly in Hispanic residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard informed KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died there.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on shooting, aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the threefold murder, assuming that it was the work of the serial murderer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfall and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Many rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of Mississippis flooded their banks and threatened with large-scale flooding following extreme rainfall, reported to the National Weather Service.</seg>

<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used for large parts of Louisiana's south until Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service indicated that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In southern Alabama, a flood warning system was set up on Friday, while it continued to regulate in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, is likely to reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that an outward-facing flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, because these rivers will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still attracted people from river water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those saved on Friday near Gloster.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose sharply overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another bull living near him would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We woke up and the water was flowing and flowing in," Hansford said.</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife, Hansford, said that in the 48 years she lived there she had never seen such a height of the river.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that all three would have saved Nothelfer in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said that the flood spread "rapidly," as severe rainfall continued and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inch rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that since Wednesday, the soil has been considerably depleted by rain.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities indicated that severe rainfall and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the failure to teach in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa gave 200 flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both of which have now been flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets fed by the floods.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodation was set up to accommodate the evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozens of roads have been closed due to the flood and sand bags provided for the inhabitants who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississipp the Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countys said that it continued to regulate on the Gulf coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his data, a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but no reports were made on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before," said Townson, "and it still comes."</seg>

<seg id="2">The police tell us that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time that a 6-year-old child has been shot up this week.</seg>
<seg id="3">The grandparents of the boy identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered several shooting injuries, including in the lungs, legs, arms and belly, but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He has made a lot of progress, his small body was shattered by bullets," said his grandmother Delores Melendez.</seg>
<seg id="6">I simply cannot believe that.</seg>
<seg id="7">The state of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and had to undergo several operations.</seg>
<seg id="8">The boy's family told the station that he was expected to be raised again.</seg>
<seg id="9">He should have started the first class in a local primary school.</seg>
<seg id="10">Brown was one of four people shot up in Germantown.</seg>
<seg id="11">Three men were also shot: Two at the age of 29 and one 32.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the 29-year-old men is in a critical state; the other two victims are in a stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The boy was shot on the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old, in a critical state, reported the transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="14">The other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men of the perpetrators could be.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators informed CBS Philadelphia that there seems to have been a cross-fire between several guards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cartridges for storm rifles traced back to various storm rifles crossed the scene.</seg>
<seg id="17">It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the street, on both sides of the walk, there were sleeves.</seg>
<seg id="19">So there seem to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved, "said Anthony Ginaldi, police officer in Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="20">Several houses and vehicles have also been hit in the area.</seg>
<seg id="21">There was no arrest and the police are currently reporting the monitoring video.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a butcher at her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's Olympic campaign in the Turne, for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, since 1984 I have been present at every summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of different skin colours.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, which is JÃ¼din and Madison Kocian, which is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has strengthened the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one female turner was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic runner and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We see the tip of this sport, but that is not the way to look like classes throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "last five," because the next Olympic team will have only four athletes in the team, and last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the reality is that Turnen is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gymnasium clubs, maintained by parents who pay for the training, setup, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, Turner will receive all their training and this is a costly and long-term commitment for families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes ever since they started with the Turn.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to allow the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to train more efficiently and easily.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my service foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable turnouts in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home city) to offer young people high-quality gyms who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health, education and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, which makes thousands of young girls interested in the Turning and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" through the wood of the Olympic team gold and thank you for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistants would like to organise further strikes after rejecting Jeremy hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials, but 58% of the 37,000 assistants who voted in an election rejected it.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the contract and said that the NHS would be in a "no-man country" and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistants will receive a new contract, which will include changes to night and weekend afternoons to improve care at unpleasant times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Assistant Assistant Committee, said last night in a Communication: "AssistenzÃ¤rnten still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current evidence crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."</seg>
<seg id="6">Progress must be made with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new Treaty, and time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes through talks have met with reluctance from the government to take part and sometimes to frustrate silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was the promise made by Jeremy Hunt only last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the pressure and address the concerns of assists."</seg>
<seg id="10">Should he not do so, the assistants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work-fighting activities.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strike chain.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54.000 assistants who will be subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS staff, called on the assistants to end the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "Work-fighting measures do not achieve anything of little but burden already overburdened teams and service providers, and only worry, need and interruption for patients, investors and their families."</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the last two months, we have spoken to the Assistant doctor's committee and responded positively to concerns about the guardianship and wound bonding with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a vocational training period, training kits, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave, and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, health education, and the German Ministry of Health were in February.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of cardiovascular patients will benefit from a Â£2-per-day medicine after the authorities have recommended that they receive more people for a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The inflammatory drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="5">NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year approach to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year approach to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and one quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls that make up coverings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When Belag breaks apart, it can cause a blood spine that clogs the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood spine dissolves, it can flow through the blood stream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca, which is marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood root islands less likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">NICE's draft guide published today recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">Fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that Ticagrelor, combined with Aspirin, is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of political correctness blows up electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report on corruption</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being knowingly ignored, as a damning government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles interrupts the police, election observers, and town hall buildings to ignore evidence of electoral abuse on account of "oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption madness, said that intimidation of religious-motives voters would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up lock-up outside electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters carry a card to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the moment, a voter only has to name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to put non-removable ink on a person's finger when they vote to prevent someone from voting twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblower should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This not only serves to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud associated with it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's electoral scandal in East London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special election court ruled that the current mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be dismissed following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices in his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman had "cynically perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community," and that he had silenced his critics with racist and Islamic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have "conducted his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which one person votes as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there is evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed particular alarm at the fraudulent ballot - with older members of the Muslim community pressuring people to vote for a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including the management of identity cards.</seg>
<seg id="20">His report states: "It was appropriate to exert pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, especially communities with a Pakistani or bangladiatorial background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior because of" politically correct "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists processing letter voting documents to stop "election killings."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report under consideration by Theresa May also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters for your card before the election.</seg>
<seg id="25">Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as it has cast its vote to prevent someone from voting twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible for election.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on requests for automatic correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban political activists from processing full letter elections and envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="29">Give the police the power to set up ballot stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ban on shooting in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in polling stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensifying training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the ballot box alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet case no penalty was shown.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The electoral court declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy incompetent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">For a number of reasons, he was found guilty of being sufficiently guilty, in accordance with the high requirements of the criminal procedure.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticizes the ineffective "check-out checks" of the electoral registers of the town halls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "Last year's Court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud legacy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities are threatening this good reputation.</seg>

<seg id="2">Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio came out this week about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proved to be an impressive double runner of Cambridge's Duchess.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this summer's 24-year-old Olympionikin is far from the only athlete fighting gold, which has its own famous double runner - at least not if you can believe the social media.</seg>
<seg id="4">In honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flying on our screens, FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympic Games with more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood's most famous.</seg>
<seg id="5">The JÃ¤ger and Wolf: Team member of the US team in the archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to Kate's double runner on the cycle track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archery of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio might be.</seg>
<seg id="7">The team member of the US team in the archery Brady Ellison caused an attack on Twitter after images on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star uncanny.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, the archery received the madness in the social media and admitted that he had been hearing from his childhood that he looked like Leo.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I do not see much resemblance, except for facial comfort," Brady told Huffington Post.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He is a good looking guy, so I would like to compliment him."</seg>
<seg id="11">One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly focus even more this year: The striking similarity between Britain's Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Russian singer Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, is supposed to be able to pass through as a double-edged singer for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.</seg>
<seg id="13">And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">A walk higher: This user believes Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception Actress.</seg>
<seg id="15">Another lasting comparison was made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyes and lips.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun-blown skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was acclaimed by fans to resemble an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."</seg>
<seg id="17">Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar facial shape and eyes.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="19">Theory put into space: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Twitter user explained their satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."</seg>
<seg id="21">Indeed, the US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal in Gabby Douglas's Turn, which has its own beautiful, wide smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Canadian channel CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "as rent went" and died during the race like "a pig."</seg>
<seg id="4">The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle squadron.</seg>
<seg id="5">Macdonald, who had been brought to the CBS commentator team to give more "color," was told: "This small 14-year-old chinese has lost the connection, baby."</seg>
<seg id="6">Too excited went down like rent, died like a pig.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thank you for that.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, sweeps the second stage of the swimming pool 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to fill the gap with China.</seg>
<seg id="9">Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after shocked by the sound and language</seg>
<seg id="10">Emmett Macfarlane tweete, "Have the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer" has died like a pig "???</seg>
<seg id="11">The Idiot did not break that they were still on show. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle squadron for women as follows: "This small 14-year-old chinese has lost the connection, baby."</seg>
<seg id="13">The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many spoke to him.</seg>
<seg id="14">Twitter users did not stand back when they heard how unsensitive Byron MacDonald was.</seg>
<seg id="15">Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "WoW, # ByronMacDonald.</seg>
<seg id="16">You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.</seg>
<seg id="17">Shortly afterwards, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC show, apologized live for the comment of MacDonald and said: "We apologize that the comment about a swimming performance was broadcast."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was an unfortunate formulation, we are sorry it happened. "</seg>

<seg id="23">We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been possible to broadcast them.</seg>
<seg id="24">Yesterday night we quickly apologized to our viewers on show and to our followers in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="25">To clarify one thing, Byrons comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, they were inappropriate and unhappy, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I would like to take a moment to apologise for the comment I made after the women's swimming pool in the CBC Olympic Games, he said.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I have referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."</seg>

<seg id="2">Buyers did not know where to look when a woman left her clothes in the middle of a prix to try underwear.</seg>
<seg id="3">To exacerbate the situation, she mustered as she looked in it, pulling her back into the shelf.</seg>
<seg id="4">She continued to browse and tried four pairs of underwear in a shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Primark shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the Unterhosen before putting them back into the shelf.</seg>
<seg id="6">A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she moved back and left business without buying anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">She said: "People could not believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">In the middle of the sales area she took a couple of underwear out of the outlay, pulled her own stockings and trousers out and tried them.</seg>
<seg id="9">"She did not even try to find a rather more discreet place to do it - she was just there, cheerful like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Everyone starred when she pulled out the underwear, which she apparently did not like because she put her back on the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="11">She repeated the same thing with three more underwear before she finally decided that she did not like anything, moved back and left.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to protect against weapons attacks with Krav Maga</seg>
<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the mirror around for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you are approaching you from the back, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the shooting line," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before beating it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him with his knees and turn away while the attacker cracks down from pain, throwing the gun out of his hands, throwing him in the face and moving backwards while turning the gun on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shutter line, take the weapon and turn it away so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and turn the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi imagines.</seg>
<seg id="12">But remember that it is the safest way to hand over your money to a robbery - unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master.</seg>

<seg id="1">Travellers Ian Wright shuffles his tongue in Europe's dirty places for a guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent a serious test of his immune system and sausages "eflex - leaking some of Europe's most dirty and despicable places.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, shot his course on a euro ticket, a yellow belt at Piccadilly Circus, a folding button of a train toilet, and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before emptying each object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and us what he will get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of leaking a pull toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repellent, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen bag.</seg>
<seg id="7">During his visit to Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing he leaked left more than a bad taste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright has become known for testing the resilience of his intestine by passing through the world and doing strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public spaces at railway stations to toilets, the task was definitely to test his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film, he said, "I was already relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he certainly lived up to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample sample showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak after its luminosity was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film, he says: "This comes close to the worst I have rocked in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I am not going to lick anything here, because it is quite appalling in this House.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both mite acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer something new to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried out crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Lass to us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in colorectal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of colorectal health and how they are linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in colorectal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom HAKALA, who led the film's direction, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had aroused some of the things I have instructed him to lick, just as the eclectic Russian toilet shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things that made it easier to get Ian to eat them and others where it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad we have taken some of these dirty treats on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey carried out by Valio in 2015, 84% of respondents associated with mite acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines, and 58% said that they use at least occasionally products containing added mite acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="1">Asocial family destroyed before Delogization social housing in Saltash, Cornwall</seg>
<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a delocalization with a loss of Â£50,000 for terrorising their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their homes, shocked housing workers found property in an irreparable state.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were bursting holes, wooden diels were burned, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was screwed to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that she now lives in private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people do not have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider, since this property will probably be regarded as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also great.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who in the meantime lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted involved street battles with baseball sleeves, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive shooting, fighting and flight.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house that may be demolished, old waste has been found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the land in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden diels were burned.</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said that they saw them fighting on the streets and had to be called regularly by the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing hired her and her partner this week violently from the property after giving them an extended 11-week period to withdraw voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">Delogization was hailed by facilitated neighbors, who said that their lives were made hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One said: "They did not care for anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say to the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that they are finally gone, it will be nice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it had failed to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived for 20 years in the house to which the police were regularly called.</seg>
<seg id="26">Garbage and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the municipal house</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "It is a disgrace that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of her family, since delocation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into account.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because behavior was extreme and their actions had to be viewed terribly for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and members of the community who have courageously gone to us and sent us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and send the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left on the ground in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delocation.</seg>
<seg id="33">Domestic workers will now have to weave waste mountains surrounding the house.</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis and orphanages, paraphernals and cash worth Â£1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after being guilty of owning a class B drug in commercial terms.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was a tomb of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After being without obstruction, Tanya and her partner are now expected to live in private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">The staff were very friendly and helpful.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will delocate tenants who do not comply with the house order</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police told us that delocation is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the house order.</seg>
<seg id="41">"This goes to those who think that they can behave without accusations, and to those who have been damaged by such behaviour," she said.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives</seg>
<seg id="3">A Portuguese P-3C Orion airplane of the Air Force set an incredible storm flight.</seg>
<seg id="4">The air forces indicated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a titanium jet plunging over a full beach.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dramatic video shots showed how the military aircraft flew almost within reach over the sun on the beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Holidaymakers began understandably to worry about the noise of the nozzle works without first seeing what happened to them through the clouds.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.</seg>
<seg id="9">Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who broadcast videos about the dramatic Fly-By in social media, said: "It flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."</seg>
<seg id="10">Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."</seg>
<seg id="11">Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and fled incredibly deep</seg>
<seg id="12">The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deep that this was the only way to detect them.</seg>
<seg id="13">The speaker said that due to poor visibility, the jet flew a little deeper than usual, but the air forces insisted that safety was never threatened at any time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, with four people killed on the island of Madeira.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly so deep because of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - limiting his view.</seg>
<seg id="16">The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise</seg>

<seg id="5">After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are growing.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump said to evangelical Christians who asked for support in key states such as Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="7">He was blamed for false reports of his candidacy, and he resumed his well-known media sneakers.</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC intends to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenias Leichtathleten is threatened by the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a fraud attempt at doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee announced that a disciplinary commission would be set up immediately to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan official said that the former Sprinter and today's Coach, John Anzrah, gave a test of uranium in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to Kenya's team management by doping inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to carry out its own investigations, with an IAAF spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, delivered the sample and signed it," said Kenias Chief Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in 2015 in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, the Kenyan Head of Mission Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed about upcoming doping tests against cash payments by athletes in his country.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was arrested when he returned to Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after many doping offences for some time.</seg>
<seg id="17">When announcing the more than 2000 Doping target controls launched by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia are particularly targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic Games began.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, WADA has withdrawn Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping measures comply with WADA rules.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a great runner-nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The country's key figures won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of ARD television reports, allegations have been made that drugs are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a considerable mentality in sports fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has been demonstrated that this sport has been extensively and systematically dopt.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russia's passageways were then excluded from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic song, similar to Romeo and Julia.</seg>
<seg id="3">A surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: The "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and met with the role of Maria a youth dream.</seg>
<seg id="6">The SimÃ³n BolÃ­var Orchestra, led by the Venetian conductor Gustavo Dudamel, is buried in the Orchestergraben: "This music is full of rhythm," he warms.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this stage Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers her favourite with Tony while younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Maria has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First because it is unique in music!</seg>
<seg id="15">Then there is Marias's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">It is therefore wise, of course naive, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"She very much resembles me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is an honour for us to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">She is an incredibly generous man.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You can see it in each of its movements, in its eyes, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important!</seg>
<seg id="27">For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudices and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorians went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">These are the same issues and they are as meaningful today as they were then.</seg>
<seg id="30">59 years later, the piece is still relevant.</seg>

<seg id="2">Harry Reid, leader of Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since Barack Obama's nomination in March.</seg>

<seg id="7">"We need to return to the depiction of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the publication of the calendars.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed caffeine," says Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the GÃ¼len-close Foundation Dialogue and World.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing Turkey to Germany in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand," says Ambassador Ali Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, of thousands of people seeking protection from Turkey in Germany if the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition," says Ali Toprak of the "World" on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because the government had already overrun Kurdish strongholds with sanctions months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were fleeing.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the failed coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many people in Europe will want to start again if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">Said Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Head of Mission deplored the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Algerian cities.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is what Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or expelled in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Head of Mission called for the Federal Government to "position itself as strongly as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters."</seg>
<seg id="15">In Germany, too, there is a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics.</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't feel safe for the first time in Germany in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the GÃ¼len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition.</seg>
<seg id="19">Fire marking as a GÃ¼len trailer destroys teachers and other academics "professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the GÃ¼len Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World."</seg>
<seg id="21">As the newspaper reports with reference to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, even before the coup, the Turks constituted the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="22">By the deadline of 30 June, this was 11.386 people, representing almost 29% of all asylum seekers (39.625).</seg>
<seg id="23">This survey does not cover the pre-war, poverty or lack of prospects.</seg>
<seg id="24">Under the Basic Law, individual persecuted persons are exclusively political, i.e. state.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: Local people are not allowed to vote for the summer election campaign - and holiday makers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the country elections will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament decided earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is not enough: Summer holidays, heat and country elections - that is clear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be persuaded by the election fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the country's holidaymakers on Usedom, RÃ¼gen or Hiddensee are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems with this: During the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers and end up counting votes are just tired.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will have to go through the popular campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say so at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his post.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting to see how much Neuling AfD cuts and what remains at the end of the coalitions.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is holding an almost inconspicuous election campaign, is seen from his large plaques.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chat a little with people, just as his legendary vocalist predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seelering got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the bloom of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, their "We create it," has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which is likely to cost him the beautiful job now.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its top candidate, the Minister for Home Affairs Lorenz Caffier, has already seen how it is when you campaign in the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale presentations; Merkel is a federal constituency in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There was probably the majority from other LÃ¤nder," Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently indicted in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is also a pity not to hear Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely renounces the usual election campaigns in marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Kokert, this only plays a "minor role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union, too, has noted that, on the land, it is destroying the basis that it must make great efforts to find a link with the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You like the left, the SPD, the Greens: Hardly any of the country's corners.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of CDU campaigners, Kokert, is also self-defeating: "They must go where they are, namely where people are: Thorns, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Social Democrats last stood behind CDU (25) with 22 percent and just before AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the 2011 election, the SPD won a clear 35.6 percent stake before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party of seven per cent in the surveys, are likely to make a leap into the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They turn holiday distress into a modern virtue and spend much of their campaign on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Online campaign," it is called the country's president Claudia MÃ¼ller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green campaigners will be looking for local voters among holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is walking through the Mecklenburgische Lakes and finding it beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her impression: "Election holiday in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 rehabilitation: Restaurants suffer from closure</seg>
<seg id="2">The speed with which the B 27 is restored has nothing to mow.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is widespread praise for those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends at 8 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="4">"They have made everything rather shaky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet petrol station.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay either.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week and everything should be ready by the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">It also praises the accommodation of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the installation of container entrance.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site migrated to the south on Monday and the closure of the AspergstraÃe in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg is resumed, the traffic situation within the town has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The traffic through the place seems to be falling.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There were some serious complaints," says Florian King, Deputy Chief Executive Officer responsible for transport management of rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of BachsstraÃe, SteinlachstraÃe, HafnerstraÃe and Weiherrain had to contend with more traffic noise, because many narrow paths were looking for and more trusted with their Navi than with signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">As a result, a number of lorries were framed in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Due to the fact that the speed limits were not adhered to, the municipality increased its demand for the measuring vehicle from MÃ¶ssingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"There were significant exceedances," says King, who made himself aware of the situation on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute has already been cut.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest way was by 77 km in the speed 30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has continued, it has become more calm.</seg>
<seg id="20">For business people on the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the street is open again for Rottenburg customers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people are not welcome to look at the maps.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 reorganisation has led to sales declines leaves everyone who is asked to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more affected and some are less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer," that is to say, produced for other companies, have little impact on the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thomas Sulz also talks about a "at most slight decline" in the car manufacturer Maier, but also acknowledges that, of course, the "lack of circulation."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most crowded are the restaurants along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert GÃ¶hner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, is very clear.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already threatening existence.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all restaurants "hit hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is estimated that sales fell by more than 50 percent.</seg>
<seg id="33">Road rehabilitation had "thrown back two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his staff had to be made redundant.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been made redundant, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President JÃ¶rg Schmidt responded to a question from GÃ¶hner as to whether there could be financial compensation by saying that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the B 27 situation.</seg>
<seg id="37">GÃ¶hner knows of other counties where such a thing was handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all cases, GÃ¶hner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are less likely to miss because of the complex traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't get there, it's also beautiful elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="42">GÃ¶hner has no doubt that his regular clients will return after the restoration work has finished.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the BSE and avian influenza crises, GÃ¶hner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clients to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Laws are constantly being curtailed in the name of combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2">Following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de MaiziÃ¨re is now presenting a thick security package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is tolerance of terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say about all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de MaiziÃ¨re gives the reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior in presenting his new security package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are not over-demanding.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other more far-reaching issues would initially be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am also involved in this.</seg>
<seg id="10">As Minister of the Interior, however, he wanted results and a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">After the recent attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ansbach, de MaiziÃ¨re left a little time to present his conclusions on security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some things are already known, proclaimed, inquired: That a new security authority should take care of breaking encrypted communications is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nor is the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and arms law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is no surprise either.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de MaiziÃ¨re is launching a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: He wants to punish pro-terrorist campaigns and to punish jihadists with double citizenship to remove the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"These will be difficult points for the SPD," says the CDU man.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, he feels that this is reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner has no chance of doing anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">De MaiziÃ¨re also presents some new ideas.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them have it in themselves: He is planning fast-track procedures for deportation and more opportunities to arrest people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees targeted to the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of tolerance for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some in a worse position than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of this is politically and legally sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some things are still unexplored and leave open questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And on some points - in the case of the unequal treatment of the patient, for example - the question arises: What is this really about security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de MaiziÃ¨re that it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be denied that the attackers of Ansbach and WÃ¼rzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">Moreover, many people were worried about security, given the high numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that deeply employed people could not be excluded in election campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="30">Internal security has focused enormously.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">There is great uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are election campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore becoming increasingly involved in internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">Over the past few days, the two parties have been highly involved.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is only a flagrant dispute over the provision of the Federal Police, then about a collection of security-policy ideas by some Unions Interior Ministers, in which the heads of portfolios also demand a ban on burka and a departure from dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De MaiziÃ¨re, too, is tired of merry tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">He does not think of a change from a double pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">It makes no sense to reopen them.</seg>
<seg id="42">And he has constitutional concerns about a ban on burka.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner has yet to show itself.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot in it that could cause controversy.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also trying to make a difference on internal security.</seg>
<seg id="46">Leader Sigmar Gabriel cautiously signals willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security."</seg>

<seg id="1">Volkswagen is still glittering.</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite diesel scandals, deliveries worldwide are increasing.</seg>
<seg id="3">But not all markets are involved.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the case of revocation, there is a term for a term.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen starts more restrained deliveries in the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Europe's largest car manufacturer, despite its many brands and some well-underway markets, can continue to show an added value over the past year.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, in July, the VW core brand weakened mainly in Western Europe, thereby again weighing up the total sales, as the company listed in the Dax reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">The VW brand sold 1.8 percent less cars worldwide in July with 449100 cars than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China's second most important market, sales were 14 percent lower than last year.</seg>
<seg id="10">At home market Germany, deliveries fell by almost a sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brand leader JÃ¼rgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, in some core markets, "changing economic conditions" had reduced purchasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU also weighed down, a spokesperson explained.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, where exhaust gases initially escalated, there is also a minus to beech.</seg>
<seg id="15">The strong support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the mainly affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is still glittering with the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only an export minus of 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles is due.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group Sales Head Fred Kappler continued to show a sales slogan from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period, worldwide 5.904 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars to be converted to workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a result of the conversion VW confirmed that the conversion of cars had no negative impact.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the vehicle has been upgraded.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the conversion, the bus terminal provides the customer with a "guarantee-equal" certificate, but does not speak of a "guarantee," as it was said on Friday in business trips.</seg>
<seg id="24">These are legal antagonisms.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now provides its German customers with a guarantee for converted diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW must comply fully with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Deviations from this will not be accepted,"</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has taken the guarantee that after the conversion, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power will not deteriorate and that all typical vehicle values will remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee," as it was used in corporate travel.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the broad term "warranty," Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, can get half a year after the conversion, with a motor damage to a workshop - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the interests of the customer, it is also important to prevent any other damage that has nothing to do with the dumping scandal from causing uncertainty as to possible warranty regulations, as it has been said.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is why VW does not use the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="1">Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will require rich savers to pay interest - the second institute in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="2">Banker Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily cash accounts."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an isolated case and sees no sign: Ordinary savers "do not have to fear paying for their austerity punitive duties."</seg>
<seg id="4">Camps banks pay money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4% penalty.</seg>
<seg id="5">This fee will be charged by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September onwards by private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros into giro or day money accounts.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The first 100,000 euros are free."</seg>
<seg id="7">Said Paul.</seg>
<seg id="8">He has been a guard against EUR 40 million for some time, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he cannot exploit.</seg>
<seg id="9">"These are in my central bank account and are responsible for 0.4% of the costs," said the banker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I cannot spend every million EUR 4000."</seg>
<seg id="11">The costs are now passed on according to the polluter pays principle.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply leaving the cash in the vaults of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I have already experienced four attacks, I don't want to be the fifth!" Said the Bank Board.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most customers would understand and switch to other types of investment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Few emigrated to other banks.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The ECB's extreme monetary policy stance causes significant costs for all banks."</seg>
<seg id="16">It is not possible to carry them alone.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or bank transfers.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land, with its Skatbank branch, had made headlines in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="19">Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay for deposits across the board, but competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."</seg>
<seg id="20">A banker said that on Lake Tegernsee there is "a clientele that is somewhat more abundant in assets."</seg>
<seg id="21">"This can become a problem for a small bank," if it cares for money free.</seg>
<seg id="22">Founded in 1911, Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kroth and Tegernsee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Famous actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Bavarian Association of Cooperative Societies "does not currently know any other banks that charge a levy on private customers' deposits,"</seg>
<seg id="25">The President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe FrÃ¶hlich, stated at the end of June: "The threshold to go to the negative towards the private customer is very, very, very high."</seg>
<seg id="26">The competition was tough, and investor migration threatened to compete.</seg>
<seg id="27">Customers in Germany will not be satisfied with this in the breadth.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: Who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment part to overrule it under the pseudonym Non-Anglo-Saxon Middle Ages with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much-talked resurrection of records is not due to a boom in Millennium, which wants to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are likely to be between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: Older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me, while walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and stuffing wild before standing, holding my hands and saying something more decisive like: "So let us take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let us look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill up the buildings where once independent sellers were established - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I am close to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood by observing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I followed by Sister Ray (data count: Two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: Eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">He says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: He is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when she appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and embarrassed.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Many things I buy are from the late 1960s, early 1970s, when I was 11 or 12.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my shop.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meet him will be on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations I have had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of record revival supporters of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers took inspiration from the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, objects that wake up happily.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is an easy way to deal with it mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We are like their social workers!" An employee flees from a stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a disk do not have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point in the news report, I would probably be very concerned, while leafing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works on Sounds of the Universe (data count: Three middle-aged men), noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Someone came here recently and said:" I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it in the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage, but it is definitely happening.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-oriented, less musical.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say, "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older people, who are only slowly arriving.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Beasts of the latest synthesizer and sexpacked pop instead of experimental jazz, it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks rather unique, but needing mental trauma is difficult to detect if you are next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more like a showcase than a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">She does not deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives with a beloved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I do not know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: URBAN Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I seem to be simulating jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teenagers who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">To the left is a staircase, a wall full of noble, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: A mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorative, some so high that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But, given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are correct, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning with the butterflies through Berwick Street's record shops and leaves through plates, while avoiding the stubborn gaze of an implacable 30-year-old false moderator who rises above the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to bring down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to dismantle 72 temporary shops where people sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">Calais's prefecture argued that these places should be demolished, because they would be a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which would risk fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups informed the Court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also pointed out that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who operate the 72 provisional shops, but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were "absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">Judge Jean-FranÃ§ois Molla said that food shops, cafÃ©s, and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the low tide was the Jungle Book Kids' CafÃ© of the camp, which is run by the public and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes and advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to keep the Kids' CafÃ©.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it said that the closure "would be a disaster for these children, of which the last eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two relief organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a sharp increase in newcomers over the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's Raser has to adapt to the next generation of speed meters: In various federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are intended to be particularly effective in transmitting packets.</seg>
<seg id="3">Vitronic's futuristic Enforcement Trailer from Wiesbaden, for example, can be used at accident points where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, there is often no infrastructure needed to ensure that the speed limit is met with a stationary flash.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or burdensome.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: Its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measurement technology can also be used to track all vehicles across several tracks simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits and transit bans after time, driving tyres and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In high-speed mode, the trailer can be moved with any car with a coupling.</seg>
<seg id="10">So that it is not easy to clamp, it is lowered in the measuring operation so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and, incidentally, shaky outer case.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the flash from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015 Vitronic's trailer has been tested and used in various federal states.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-Series Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-step, backward, line run and raw force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept away by the not-so-bad silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina, and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It may be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Brite will have a gold medal tomorrow around his neck: Fiji's chief coach Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way to go.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, Ryan lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This sleep will blow, but progress is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks crash out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co.</seg>
<seg id="14">Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner with four minutes of play.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A noble torch of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa reaching a third gate, but it stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute JASA Veremalua leased a touch down in the right corner and it stood at 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the reanpfiff and there was still more than a minute game time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou spoke with other weak Tacklings from the GB team and stormed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the pause.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still learns.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is the case.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB made fundamental changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a total of four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Josua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant play by Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South Sea explorer, whose fans sang, jumped flags and danced in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the i-bag with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pfiff wept, the fijis wrapped themselves and GB kicked in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Previously, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5, and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a narrow semi-finals match - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footprint and reached a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, secured the profit - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the Blood of the Trainer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotinal gold other than those games, and that's what it means.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder to the last 220 hard hieve, which go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although it was only the two who sat at the helm, there were three votes in the boat.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39.th unchallenged effort, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the type of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the run, there is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more helpful than the trainer, who, 30 months ago, did not know whether he would survive that day at all when cancer was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bubble cancer, which is operational and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite a bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was fortunate that he could begin treatment in early 2014, outside the season, which kept interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing itself is a challenge, but it makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the unemployability of the victory, her first thoughts were with Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was the head of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a mission in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week.</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much this means to me, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him, he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to be trapped.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not trying to do something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We did not want a firework today, we simply wanted to achieve a good result, we wanted to go further and win what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before taking decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I did not want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have put too much pressure on us.</seg>
<seg id="39">It took about six months in London to understand that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was so new for me and I was so stretched.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clarity for 31 years</seg>
<seg id="2">The Managing Director of the "Veitensteingruppe," Ruppert GÃ¶ller, is retiring.</seg>
<seg id="3">The association is considered "Bavarian-wide exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="4">A small Frenchman drinking water association as a model for large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is what the original sound said some time ago in a speech by the Bavarian Radio.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little later, the water forum of the government of Lower Franks appreciated the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="7">The work of the Veitensteingruppe was regarded as exemplary throughout Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert GÃ¶ller, who was a 31-year-old member of the special purpose association, of which 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water association of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with a population of about 5500.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach are member communities.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud BÃ¼hl (FW), recalled that Rupert GÃ¶ller was hired as a water coach in 1985 and was already appointed Managing Director of the Object Association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"His tasks have been very diverse, ranging from water management and maintenance work to office and organization activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," said the Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">She mentioned the start-up and inauguration of the new wells (1994), the purchase of land in the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the restoration of the high reservoirs (1999), the acquisition of central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and there has been constant innovation, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her Laudatio she praised GÃ¶llers for loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">Just a few weeks ago, he was able to present the success concept of the Veitensteingruppe for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert GÃ¶ller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best waterguard and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a highlight from his point of view, he described the Brunnenbau and the restructuring of the purpose-band.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the greatest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here, at minus 17 degrees, the whole night will have to work so that the villages can be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even the supply of Neubrunn could only have been maintained once, because the high container from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water intended association was handed over to Daniel StÃ¼rmer from Lauter, who took over the succession of Rupert GÃ¶ller.</seg>

<seg id="15">The competent police in LÃ¼beck initially did not want to provide information on the course of the day or the relationship between the perpetrators and the victims, but confirmed that a human being had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This is a crime of killing."</seg>
<seg id="17">"We don't say more at the moment," said a police spokesperson in LÃ¼beck.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to eye witnesses, a special mission (SEC) was at the scene.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Light vision for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry is being spared additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens on the industry from green electricity production are on the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Fridays), the German General Newspaper (WAZ).</seg>
<seg id="5">"I am really pleased that we have finally achieved this after two years of tough negotiations."</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gas from the furnace to produce electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said to the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants will an EEG charge of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this is not the case in the steel industry either.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG Metals welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on the production of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The status quo of the current regime would thus be broadly established.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry were particularly important.</seg>
<seg id="14">"With regard to our" Steel is Future "campaign, this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Others must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Climate and employment targets also need to be weighed up in the reform of the emissions trading scheme," says IG Metal CEO JÃ¶rg Hofmann in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to deteriorate as China's world's largest producer country, faced with weak domestic demand, threw steel on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">During this spring, the situation has relaxed somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on imports have an effect on imports, and on the other, the economic outlook in China has deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German branch primary Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious, despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced just six per cent less crude steel than in the previous month, as reported by the Steel Association on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the amount produced has now returned to the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="32">The association expects an increase in output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: Good singing for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">The Singen has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl she was in school choir, in Lehramt studies she taught music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a sample she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she is doing her health and spirit a good job.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Singen is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Regular interaction allows seniors to establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because social and family structures often emerge at age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To deny and organize, to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of unity."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be tough in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Seniors train deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly ask for their lungs do not get out of the purest so quickly in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at age, Singen is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">Singen often has a very special effect on elderly people, says Ursula Lenz of the German Association of Senior Citizens' Organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, common singing was much more important; it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, explains it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often combined with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and melodies in particular, self-dementia-sufferers escape from long-standing events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, when singing, a special performance is required for the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, focus on one's own voice and on a given rhythm, adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Older people who live alone practice not only focusing on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition of singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: If I long for something, I will be better and more vigilant beyond me - this experience will be strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="26">So there are good reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, let Lenz know.</seg>
<seg id="28">You do not sing alone - 50 singing people, who is listening when a sound goes by?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer senior citizens have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the audience in a senior choir, you can easily join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the villages surrounding them.</seg>
<seg id="32">If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the parish or church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior citizens can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the Internet search.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, please join a choir, Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cats respond more sensitively than kittens to the horrors of young animals</seg>
<seg id="2">Biologists in Hanover have studied the effect of crying cat babies on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">To their surprise, the men were not cold either - but, unlike the females, they were always the same.</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can see the level of fatigue of cat babies when they mix the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="5">They react 10% faster to the sounds of kittens who are in great need, as scientists from the veterinary college and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH) found.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kater also responds to kittens "calls - but always the same.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Obviously, the acoustic differences between miking less and heavily stimulated young animals are either unperceptible or not important for men," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of MHH.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is a dentist of the study published this Friday in the magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kittens' shrines are different from the urgency of their need for assistance.</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult kittens and eight female kittens from MHH were observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played on the one hand by small boys who were taken out of the sausage box for three minutes and were separated by mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more intense kittens, which were also raised.</seg>
<seg id="13">Researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.</seg>
<seg id="14">"All females, even those who have not yet had their own young people, reacted differently to the horror," said Konerding.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned around faster to the loudspeaker when this call was played by the very rugged kittens.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be inclined or developed with gender maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"One surprise was that the men reacted at all," said the biologist.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past, scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noise on several occasions in humans.</seg>
<seg id="19">Some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were mothers or not, reported the biologist Marina Scheumann.</seg>

<seg id="1">Podolski enters Supercup with "Gala"</seg>
<seg id="2">Hakan SÃ¼kÃ¼r is a football legend in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan SÃ¼kÃ¼r.</seg>
<seg id="4">He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match is taking place in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="6">Before the duel of the archrival between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual."</seg>
<seg id="7">Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the storm attempt in July, the government estimated that the daily lives of ordinary citizens should not be affected.</seg>
<seg id="8">But this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah GÃ¼len, who is blamed for the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nor will it stop before football.</seg>
<seg id="10">The prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against former Starkicker Hakan SÃ¼kÃ¼r.</seg>
<seg id="11">So the South Coast now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="12">SÃ¼kÃ¼r is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah GÃ¼len, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the state of emergency for 90 days is still in force until October, in fact, it has virtually no impact on the lives of most Turks.</seg>
<seg id="14">Erdogan declared his nocturnal "democracy guards" in public places throughout the country on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fans of the Besiktas Workers Club in particular are traditionally not friends of the president.</seg>
<seg id="17">But what unites the majority of Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats Galatasaray or Besiktas.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Gala" Cup winner will see Lukas Podolski again.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the past season, Cologne proved its sporting value: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first time as a top scorer of his club.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the final match against Fenerbahce, he scored 1: 0 victory.</seg>
<seg id="22">The newspaper "Fanatik" applauded him: "He was the best in the place."</seg>
<seg id="23">He has completed the season in an excellent way and secured the Cup for his team.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record champion was a reconciling one.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the round-table K.o in the Champions League, the "lions" also varied early in the European League.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the SÃ¼per Lig it was only six.</seg>
<seg id="27">The season was not good.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Pokal was the only way to win something.</seg>
<seg id="29">"That is what we have achieved and that is the most important thing," Podolski said.</seg>
<seg id="30">For Master Besiktas the year went better.</seg>
<seg id="31">Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who set the foundation for the 14th title with 26 martyrs as SÃ¼per-Lig-goers.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also why fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the same time, the Gomez Treaty Treaty and Besiktas only announced after the coup attempt not to return due to the political situation in the country after its EM holiday.</seg>
<seg id="34">"If Mario wants to come to us, he only has to say it," said the specialist magazine "Kicker" Clubchef Fikret Orman.</seg>
<seg id="35">To this end, however, the stormer would have to be prepared to give up around a third of its annual salary, estimated at EUR 7.5 million, Orman made it clear: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."</seg>

<seg id="2">The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already locked twice for doping (2001 and 2006).</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa must not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="4">Other committed paschtathletic sins can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="5">The issue of doping continues to determine the headlines at the Rio Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who, after a doping blockade, had indicted her start right shortly before the games, was unscrupulously shot and burned out at her start (100 meters breast).</seg>
<seg id="7">It was a bizarre scene: She was still staged into the hall with her appearance.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it was established that she would not bring gold, the audience broke into a jubilee storm.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are many other athletes who, despite the doping past, are starting at the Rio Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="10">An overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-Staffel / USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was already locked twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since its inception, the 2004 Olympic champion and former World Champion have been running even faster than before, being the number one in the world in more than 100 m in 9.80 seconds, and is considered to be the biggest challenge for Usain Bolt.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Staffel / Jamaika): The two-man Olympic champion and seven-fold World Champion had to sit down a six-month-long lock in 2010 after she was proven to take the pain agent Oxycodon.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bombings in Thailand - Austrian injured - multiple deaths</seg>
<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said Thomas SchnÃ¶ll, Speaker of the Foreign Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="3">She had suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital, but had already been able to leave.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her home trip was scheduled for early September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether the further explosions on Phuket and Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens remains unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard,</seg>
<seg id="7">In Hua Hin, approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok's capital city, two bombs were exploded at first on Thursday evening in an outlet.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman had been killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Friday morning two jumps went up again, with another man killed, according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured at the Detonation near the Patong beach, which is popular with holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani, on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb killed an urban worker.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the springboard had gone into the air in front of the revolt of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and Chumphon on the south-east coast claimed several injuries.</seg>
<seg id="15">One assumes a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The bombings carry the same handwriting," Armeegeneral Danai Kritmethavee told journalists on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We expect this to be a coordinated attack."</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to comment on possible motives - but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or to international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.</seg>
<seg id="22">Instead, they assume that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">Over the past few days, the authorities have received intelligence about upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact timing and location.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment areas.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but most of them are not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace used by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej for years.</seg>
<seg id="28">Following the current bombings, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that it should follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High safety risk (safety level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After disputes between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessary journeys to these provinces will be lost.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (safety level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This will give the military great influence in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos, while the country is moving towards stability, improving the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, which took power after a period of bloody unrest in 2014, benefits itself from restoring stability and order to the Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="36">But the military has not managed to control the revolt of Muslim rebels that has been raging in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than a year ago, an attack on a popular Hindu shrine killed 20 people in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack on the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="1">The right "Identity Movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.</seg>
<seg id="2">After several provincial offices, the constitutional defenders in the federal government also observed the group.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We see evidence in the 'Identitarian Movement' of efforts against the liberal democratic order ', said Constitutional Protection Chairman Hans-Georg MaaÃen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">Immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are being discriminated against in an extremist way.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why we are now seeing the movement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Identity Movement" is a group of French roots which has been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">It opposes "multiculturalism," "uncontrolled mass immigration," and the "loss of one's identity by exaggeration."</seg>
<seg id="8">Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identities."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr MaaÃen said that his authority had been closely associated with the national authorities in the decision.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Groups like the 'Identity Movement' are trying to collect their target group where they stand," said the head of the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="11">In general, extremists try to address them with youth-oriented language, often with poppies.</seg>
<seg id="12">Islamists and right-wing extremists alike.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not a shameful advertisement for your own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">Propaganda should address people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="16">That is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most recently, there have been reports from several federal states about contacts between "identities" and AfD politicians.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said that he had no knowledge of this.</seg>
<seg id="19">For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is important that the party concerned - in this case the AfD - changes its direction by certain people who are extremist, and becomes so extremist.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is therefore crucial whether such people have a controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not evident.</seg>
<seg id="23">In view of the significant increase in lawfully motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Mr MaaÃen said that he was not yet talking about new right-wing terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, we have seen in recent years that there can be legal terrorism structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.</seg>
<seg id="26">It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are being formed, which are planning attacks on asylum seekers, on refugee homes or attacks from other far-right extremist motives.</seg>
<seg id="27">But there is no sign of a German or European-wide control of legal terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created at regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Worried about many attacks on the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is the worrying thing.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many suspects in attacks on asylum-seekers had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or right-wing supporters.</seg>
<seg id="32">"So many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right-wing extreme right-wing extremists who may have been politically indifferent or, for example, elected CDU, SPD or left, but who have radicalized themselves by right-wing extremist sentiments."</seg>

<seg id="1">Rio 2016: ROBEL Kiros Habte becomes Internet hub</seg>
<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows ROBEL Kiros Habte's courageous performance at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimming pool from Ethiopia flowed so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV images.</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral Internet thite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old, with a delay of 48 seconds, ended his lead and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, it was his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why is the 24-year-old still participating in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got special start rights from the International Swimming Federation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to promote swimming in underrepresented countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since most athletes are running in orthopia, Habte simply wanted to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media called him "ROBEL der Wal."</seg>

<seg id="17">His time, he beat only with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freistil, played no role.</seg>

<seg id="2">The consumer research firm GfK will replace its head Matthias Hartmann.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resignation came suddenly - but not surprisingly.</seg>

<seg id="5">Turmoil at the head of Nuremberg's market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the company's resignation, the industry's worldwide number five is facing a new start.</seg>
<seg id="6">GFK CEO wants to leave the company by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahert already leaves the Supervisory Board as of 12 September.</seg>
<seg id="8">As early as September 1, the Executive Board member Gerhard Hausruckinger informed the company.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will officially assume the role of a "CEO" until a successor to Hartmann is found.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a reason for the withdrawals, the company called "different views" on the long-term business orientation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Details a company spokesman did not want to mention on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="13">In investor circles, it was said on Friday that shareholders were last disappointed with the continued success of the restructuring that began years ago.</seg>

<seg id="20">In terms of the first half of the year, sales fell by 3.4 percent, at EUR 721.2 million.</seg>

<seg id="1">Charges per cubic metre of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros (up to 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (up to now 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the Azendorf plant, the waste water charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvements are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a surplus calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will be EUR 4.37 per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd SteinhÃ¤user (CSU) reported, when approving the household by the Councillor Kulmbach, undercover was found for these wastewater plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">On the basis of legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants at a cost-effective price.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, citizens and businesses from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases range from 48% to 67%.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel, a recalculation of charges for the waste water treatment facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calendar period should also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The serious increase in charges led Schmidt to the fact that all three waste water plants are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water treatment rate ranging from 6800 to 12000 cubic metres per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, wastewater supply in all three plants has been slightly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, during the last calendar period, all three plants have suffered a considerable amount, not least because of their age of rehabilitation and repair.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are nearly 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf sewage plant due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Welschenkahl pump plant, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor plants had to be overhauled from scratch, and after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be disposed of, sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to meet water requirements.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "These exceptional expenses have been met by the advanced maintenance and care costs which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below current levels in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">SteinhÃ¤user made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants, the costs of operation and maintenance will be "fully realised."</seg>
<seg id="20">Schmidt added: "</seg>
<seg id="21">In the view of SteinhÃ¤user, the situation for these plants will continue to be precarious in the long term, especially as the Friesenbachtal wastewater treatment area cannot be extended by these plants because they are deficient facilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is unsensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unveiled, proprietary tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies a day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All misdeeds come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have in the past attracted criticism, alleging that the App Blackface would promote or promote white skin as a beauty solution.</seg>
<seg id="8">This week, when some users proposed a filter that gave them snake eyes, false teeth, and darkened cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "Yellow Sight."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered whether these repeated controversies highlighted a major problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of vulnerable clichÃ©s.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others firmly rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and, to say the least, unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reprehensible Asian cartoon and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-transparent, but that the yellow view has been pulled into the decreasing extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling blocks.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless campaign of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats "large audience of young people - who are different in terms of race than their older opponents - could rather expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than they used to be," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account called on others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a paper for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, male leader and ended her performance with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Either they have no representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce, so that they can make such choices," said the Chinese-American zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors working there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable, to say what about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their views, a complaint that Snapchat has largely failed to answer.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently recruited a personnel officer who focused on underrepresented communities and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu, for his part, said that she will close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if she needs more users like us to say that this is not O.K."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, says Congress Committee</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed a Congress committee of inquiry to report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, secret service committees, and the Wehrmacht, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of America's efforts to fight the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command (Cencom) is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Intelligence-related information typically obtained by high-level CENTCOM commanders was regularly more positive than other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"What happened at CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership errors in CENTCOM range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Though it does not provide direct evidence that Obama's leaders have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have been exposed to pressure from their prerogatives to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions, and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts,"</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CENTCOM member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">Said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas.</seg>
<seg id="14">From mid-2014 to mid-2015, central command leaders changed intelligence reports to downplay ISIS's risk in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republicans launched the Task Force after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about manipulating reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed information while the investigation will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further CENTCOM reports are under way by the General Inspector of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In 2014 and 2015, CENTCOM created an excessively restricted process for the production of intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services," said the High-Level Democrat in the Committee, Member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Ship.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, Mr. Ship said, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged morality among analysts and "gave too little room for dissenting opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats indicated that they had not found any evidence of intervention by the White House by CENTCOM analysts regarding a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress's investigation were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector, which were received after complaints from CENTCOM analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press officer, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congressional reports, while the investigation of the general inspector was still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also said that "experts sometimes have very divergent views on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigation has repercussions beyond the issue of a successful US-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of defense officials).</seg>
<seg id="27">But last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of incidents of more than ten years ago, when a CENTCOM analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then George W. Bush administration, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, saw only a small occupying force in Iraq and left little time to think about the invasion in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government officials, found that, contrary to the government's statements, aerial strikes against refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have started operating to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This insight was not published, however, reported to the Times in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms then commander Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessively positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates over Japan during a 6-1 victory, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever did.</seg>
<seg id="4">She said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">But she knows that: The American women are in the Olympic race at 4-0 and are on the same footing in their group with the British in the first place after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place in their group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will be a little longer for the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game starts on Saturday, the American women have sparked a surprising bloom through their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places in London.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at the age of three had a hockey sleeper in her hands (her two older sisters played sport at Drexel University), she became a national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came 2012, when everything went wrong for them and their team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, started to turn to better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to throw away the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the door rigging in the first half of the game with a back hand from the nearby area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into play without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly hesitant and held the match from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and lured the ball to give the American women a 2-0 leadership.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US Torkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous matches.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a course.</seg>
<seg id="25">Like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the era of the Olympic Games, the Zen des Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, however late it is, there are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a fast track between competition and ambition.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch was itself a burning stack, stretching from the bracelet to the swimmer to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You cannot turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's swarm with horror, could well have been among these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and good-health TV advertising if he were a swimmer, turner or even a fan.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, in some shadows there are sports that are not generally recognised: Aerial pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may it prevail for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I may make modest arguments for my particular favorite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of Trampolin.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so sparingly over the past 16 years that many people who I had asked did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and by 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outside charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earth-bound enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonical quotation of its never-ending cloudy impact - but also the grace of the turtle and diving, the two sports it essentially unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means "jumping board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air, and must have a series of falling movements (turning, lifting and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to the performance, difficulty level and flight time.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-way athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal-hungry must go up and down in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down in the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also another cave-like goal in television broadcasting: That of the world or the Olympic record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even throw a spectator into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I find somewhat arduous when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she jumps up, seemingly heavy as an astronaut, then down, then effortlessly upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is just as tough as competition can be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">Women's qualifications and endings will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 1.00 Eastern Time; men's training sessions will also take place on Saturday at 1.00 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the endings as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">Amid the Olympia mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the raising of awareness can only be achieved through the creation and objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turners recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his air-going new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="1">"One generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with violent opposition from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia in the process of collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But, in recent months, protests against the government have shocked the country and expanded to more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was unmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses indicated that policemen shot and killed on tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos circulating about the protests that are likely to be from last year or beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to take a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, Project Leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although Ethiopia was far from a model of democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the government's repression - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many have been sent to exile or prison, killed or driven to the foothills of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"If you suppress people and have no other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">All young people are protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are many complaints that cover everything from land use to sword about the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100% of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this tortuous, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less enforced in recent years, could exploit turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years of adrenaline.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: Smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and Internet services have improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said they had gathered for protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For the time being, Amharas, who come from orthopedic predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowlands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"We are coordinating under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, leader of Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by Tigray ethnic groups, which account for around 6% of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade, and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until he died from an unpublished disease in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly confident in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special envoys to treat opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," Mr Abdi said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray-controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uprising in 2005, after thousands of protests against elections that, according to analysts, appear to have been consumed by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new shuttle train, and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the Ethiopian Government from intensifying its internal maladministration.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it is taking a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters attacked in Gondar, an amusing city, run by Tigray, and hatred of Tigray is becoming increasingly common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed that base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"This," Mr Abdi said, "is a very thin grass-roots hike."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains Obama's claim to have founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by suggesting that his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were not meant seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate with the American public whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligently.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow combatants, who are trying to protect him during an eventful period, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the suggestion at an election campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump reverted to the claim on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr Trump said that he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he was absolutely serious about the accusation.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt sought to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism has slowed down on Mr. Trump, while trying to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling demand levels.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton made speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr Trump tried to return to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Trump has already raised sarcasm for his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said that Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said "Of course I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift language boundaries in politics and then to roll back as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the response is." Said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">I also believe, however, that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has taken an even more noble tone, as his survey numbers have fallen further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership with a great advantage in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr Trump generally tries not to apologise for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But, while he focuses more attention in recent months on his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's henchmen have put his loyal supporters in the uncomfortable situation of standing with him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, has worked hard to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani on the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown small organization, he called it backbenders, completely wrong, and it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that Obama's administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by refusing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before Friday's election campaigns in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being biased against each of his words.</seg>
<seg id="27">He mocked the "poor, distressing" television experts who try to understand him and said, "You can not!."</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr Trump's apology as yet another demonstration that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once squeezed out of the market, CafÃ© in Greenpoint returns</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a shabby cafÃ© in Williamsburg, where you could only pay for bar, which had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices of his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront were squeezed out.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Soap Cherie business, which replaced Verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was the last loss in a city in which the population of the country was estimated.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is a change, it is also a rediscovery.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">Coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old cafÃ©, who is the owner and manager of the new cafÃ©.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him money for a new outsider, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, maintained a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said that he also wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese, and there are garnishes such as capers and acidic onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are nature tours.</seg>
<seg id="21">The cafÃ© no longer serves beer, for which there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said that he had noticed a constant stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verse regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after moving to Greenpoint, it would take the path.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee rings for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It became clear to me that it was because of coffee and culture that I liked," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced coffees, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verse in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went to work there and inevitably ordered the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I arrived quarter after seven, every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Today Rosenthal still receives his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he was not concerned that the soap business took over the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold-baked coffee of the cafÃ© as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will go into her offer," said Rodriguez.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish residents Greenpoints also accepted the cafÃ©.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to issue it soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The site also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold baked coffee in the bottle.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the cafÃ© will expand to a neighbouring building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the cafÃ© closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new cafÃ© opened, Whitt said that entering the place and ordering felt like returning home.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I had to smell it," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his rise as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt began his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a faible for sophisticated Fifth Avenue delicacies such as PÃ¢te de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu this day was slightly more modest: Filled eggs in tomato sauce, potatoes and dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes "last book" Chop Suey "was about Chinese cuisine in the US, while in her book" 97 Orchard, "Ziegelman tells about life in a housing house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear at Harper Verlag on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese orchard with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, Truthahn with potatoes and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered hackbrates, this found the couple appropriate for a discussion about eating in the Great Depression era.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Rich food was very popular," Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were geese bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper, which stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many pears that they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Coe grinded.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">Women's teams cook for male fellows and freshly baked pasta is served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" points to the ways in which the country was no longer a closed country.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Just as eagerly awaited was the new budget diet: Mysterious dishes such as bread and casserolls became basic foods, the casserolle as "wonderful way to recycle food remains," Ziegelman noted, as cooks could hide unappetite ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which has been the focus of American cuisine for years, has become a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures were tried out because a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research into the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It was not a popular addition at lunch," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Soil butter and baked onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical of many of the home economics concepts.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - driven the country's eating habits so much.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and meet the challenge of turning pamping like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports of the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers's Lass-me-cake meal, are palatable.</seg>
<seg id="36">While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the millionaire man of the world he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and carried a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully alien to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the arrival of a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs Roosevelt led the White House to produce the boring food in Washington, but also one of the hardest prepared. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the Great Depression era to deal with food was discarded as soon as the country was back on its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, and how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits when writing the book - for example, how she could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"She had a real fear of food waste," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ziegelman remembered: "She really made people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the windsurfing incident.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates had been cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe produced a dessert that they had prepared at home: The plum dessert that President Roosevelt had lunch.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It is called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a send name.</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no cracked cream, only plum, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone appeared a little reluctantly a spoon in the tame, brown glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">Surprisingly, it did not taste badly.</seg>
<seg id="53">Coe made a supplementary three times.</seg>
<seg id="54">Like a Can-Do Budgetiger, he said to his wife, "A few hacked walnuts would help."</seg>

<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Madness," comments Alexander Scheulein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which represents a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist had long believed that Greenland haired.</seg>
<seg id="13">There was no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about Greenland's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">They saw their temporal speed when they placed six animals in front of Spitsbergen with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey still do this sharks: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had lured the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt slaughtering animals or patrol on the bottom of the icefall and seek carcasses that fall down from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now investigated 28 Greenland sharks, which caught fishermen off Greenland between 2010 and 2013 or Spitsbergen as by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest hair was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetres were measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the hair using the carbon 14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the hair, the proteins contained therein are not renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had remarkably large carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was supposed to be after the early 1960 "s, when nuclear weapons attempts drove larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests in the 220 centimetres length of third-smallest animal, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in its 2012 investigation.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all major Greenland sharks had normal quantities of carbon-14 in their linchpin, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">Indeed, for a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark, the carbon footprint showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was known that Greenland-shark females will only be raised when they are longer than four metres.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers could assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland's hair can obviously be reproduced at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">That, too, is likely to be a world record for vertebral animals.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methusal systems live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon stood at the neck of a 120-year-old Harpunenspitze, was also caught in Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and older.</seg>
<seg id="37">In addition, in order to keep warm in the cold water, animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, which causes the animal to lose heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: They have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"A smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheulein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frankfurt benefits from Brexit</seg>
<seg id="2">As a result, competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg is the best way to attract jobs and firms relocated from London.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael VoigtlÃ¤nder, Head of Competence for Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets at the IW.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been granted authorisation in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="6">Large US banks are making use of this.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks have already announced the relocation of jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which unites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the eurozone's largest banks, as well as other key authorities such as the European Insurance Supervision EIOPA and the ESRB risk correlation, is the case.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with supervision," says IW Professor VoigtlÃ¤nder.</seg>
<seg id="12">Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry but, like Dublin, it is worse in terms of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to its large airport.</seg>
<seg id="14">The city also has easy access to commercial properties.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtland.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the Seine, renting first-class commercial real estate is 50% higher than on the Main.</seg>
<seg id="17">Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good health care and infrastructure and less crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a ranking of the Mercer management consultancy, the city ranks seven, Luxembourg ranked number 19, Dublin ranked 33 and Paris 37.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although quality of life is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concludes.</seg>
<seg id="20">But, despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial center in Europe, the economists say.</seg>
<seg id="21">The balance of power also speaks for this: In London, according to the figures from the Landesbank Helaba, around 144000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015, compared to 62500 in Frankfurt.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton earns 10.75 million in 2015 and pays 34.2% federal taxes</seg>
<seg id="2">Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax declaration on Friday, which showed a $10.75 million income for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2015, Clinton's $1 million donated for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $5.3 million in speech fees; former Secretary of State gave $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on her term in the State Department.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clinton's nominee for Vice-President Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, has published his tax declarations of the last ten years.</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backtracking over his previous promises to publish his tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not obliged to do so by law.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax test by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.</seg>
<seg id="10">"You are on the train," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter about the publication of the Democratic presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Adviser, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax audits have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about assets, his donations to charitable organizations, his business practices, and various other ties, especially Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has already grasped the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in which senior Republicans are calling on Trump to publish his tax declaration.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Thursday she also raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations." She said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax during the 1990 "s, and an economic journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday, saying that this may still be the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">Federal taxes have become an issue in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Obama also supports the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="20">During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose home country is Berkshire Hathaway, called for Trump to meet to exchange tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="21">Buffett said that he was also subject to an IRS tax test, and Trump was afraid of voters, not tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clinton's campaign published tax returns back until 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.</seg>
<seg id="24">The 2015 Clinton tax declaration showed that it received only USD 100 of its income as a reward, unlike most Americans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their main asset was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clinton dividends and earnings of USD 109,000 were taxed.</seg>

<seg id="2">Nature defenders in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into human-inhabited settlements - they are throwing condoms on them filled with chilipuder.</seg>
<seg id="3">The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea of doing so years ago, has stepped up its support along with US nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and harvesting without infringing animals.</seg>
<seg id="4">Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friday is World Telephone Day dedicated to animal welfare.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Since we developed the... Toolkit, we have seen a change in attitudes within these communities, with much more confidence that they can dissuade the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide Damian Bell said in a communication.</seg>
<seg id="7">The first two steps include the illumination of the elephant with a torch and the bladder into a horn.</seg>
<seg id="8">If he is not deterred, a so-called "chilicloud" is thrown.</seg>
<seg id="9">Chilipuder mixes with earth together with a fireworks basket into a condom whose end is turned to the ignition.</seg>
<seg id="10">When it is ignited, the condom bursts with a bang and spends fine dust on Chilipuder into the air.</seg>
<seg id="11">A hat usually already out to hunt the elephant.</seg>
<seg id="12">One last possibility is a shipyard that shoots a gold fire plant into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uprising after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre-election because it "requested" Arab guests according to an employee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah," left his anger at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of country selections of the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="5">The country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel rooms.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible for Israel to be eliminated and deleted in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?</seg>
<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own Call Center.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">The answer he received was "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hotel worker said that the measure was a "deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels."</seg>
<seg id="12">The reason behind this caused even more anger in the director.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Most of our guests are Arabs and they asked for the preselection to be deleted," has been quoted by Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reported the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were appalled and dismayed by this event.</seg>
<seg id="16">That is really very shameful.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more disgraceful.</seg>
<seg id="18">That does not require any explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">We expect the hotel to draw "the right conclusions," said the official.</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident caused quite a lot of resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some told the Kempinski Hotel that it had "succumbed" to the alleged calls of Arab guests.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Shame on you," it was said in another speech that pointed out that the hotel located on the prestigious KurfÃ¼rstendamm is close to a synagogue.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hotel quickly dismissed all charges and called the incident a "oversight" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, reported The Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There has never been a direct instruction not to include Israel in the quick-selection list," the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman of the Kempinski Hotel.</seg>
<seg id="25">It adds that the country preference has now been added.</seg>

<seg id="3">Four stages have been completed together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next round of Romance pilgrimage of all Ministrants in a year's time, the St. Anna Oberministrantenround has decided to prepare and conduct a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">A number of pilgrimage destinations were examined and a final decision was made for the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opening of the Baroque Church on the Fribourg MÃ¼nster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Holy Rooms were on their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, parish priest Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims' crosses and gave the pilgrimage's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb there was a train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a MÃ¼nster of Our Lady of Our Lady and the pilgrimage route from MÃ¼nster.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the morning and in the evening, the individual daily tours were accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way the Minis made Rast on field crosses, chapels or churches again and again to sing a song from specially assembled Pilger-Liedheft.</seg>
<seg id="11">For overnight stays there were pastures of the local parish churches.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stages Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a tasty and strong dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second day went on to Furtwangen to GÃ¼tenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, the stage was followed by St. Peter, who was the most demanding route, but had to go down about 500 metres of altitude at the time of the heat and then come back.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the evening, the earned reward was a joint barbecue at the bathing pasture.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, the final stage went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Intentionally relieved and happy, the minis arrived later in the afternoon at the Freiburger MÃ¼nster and crossed the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">God was thanked with a small impulse.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the evening fair in MÃ¼nster, the Minis at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by co-operative Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">The pilgrims were able to visit the Sakristei and the High altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day there was still time for the Breisgaumetropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">Finally, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong Community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="1">Schotte Callum Skinner storms home as Brite Gold for cycling</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner crashed last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the London title in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had taken on board.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place at the World Cup in London in March, despite Hoys resignation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in good time as a hint.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man she stayed with when she saw potential in the Scots that has now developed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but the New Zealand countries won the first round in the standard races.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes fell short after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and skinner kept it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy was a major part of the transformation in which Hindes went up in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and struck Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said: "It is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simply incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph on Kennys and Hoys side, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally on track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such a surprising victory, there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: "It feels like London with all the GB flags."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have met as a team over the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly out of so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won by seven out of ten titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kennys it is possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born).</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I only enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that won gold in London in 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he fought with representatives before qualification when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13.260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong team of railway cyclists to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and catch a char of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional account of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were reduced.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, such as the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sex and murder charges and the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the merger of Portland as a result of the abolition of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of Portland's aluminium meltdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers "jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus end all supply contracts, as the supplier notified.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step follows the decision by the government in Victoria earlier this year not to grant further subsidies to the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 20-year subsidy expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs are at stake in the Alcoa plant in Portland.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moreover, domino effects may occur, as meltdown consumes about 10% of Victoria's total power generation.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry, leading to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa's merger in Portland is losing money and risking closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners would terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is mainly owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through melting,"</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "collateral transactions" which should have entered into force from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Therefore AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute 17 to revenue in fiscal year," said the electricity supplier.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential effects on AGL revenues from GJ 18 onwards are currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to cancel the contracts did not adversely affect the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melting plant or to guarantee electricity supply to the melting plant."</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even though it is still guilty of explaining why it resigned from the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn against the possible closure of Portland in Victoria and Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the industry's poor economic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="22">Referring to the analysts "statements earlier this week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts and tomago every year about 900 megawatts of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us as a generator of electricity, that would not be good, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the U.S. Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In a room full of people I love, brought me the sight of this cover to the wine," Kendall wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The final release of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashian similar?), crippled reality video that shows the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problems Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the popular Showbiz Onkelling producer.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the clichÃ© action almost every birthday pond of a child's show (Seacrest put the phrase "You want us to forget you?" With the honesty of a cartoon canteen on a TV station at 8 am), but Kris somehow had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashian has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's great sister Kim may have beaten her in the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on display in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine's September edition is a league for herself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most selling edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a volume similar to a picture band rather than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the Wood 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years images of the magazine were leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, clearly, more "celebrities who model" than "models that are celebrities" were on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and conductor brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even if Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthroughs model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good society.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good snapchat video (even if it's all true for Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenner's success does not suit everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them "the pieces of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings boasted again when the message came out on the Vogue Cover with Jenners.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the misery seems to be at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the truest sense of the word, it is a supermodel.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your founding of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her spare time she is on reality TV, probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="1">16 000 people a year</seg>
<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the country's most needy needs are rejected annually by the local authorities, while the industry is anticipating the impact of further budget cuts on already overloaded transactions.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence, and those who do not have funds for unjust delosions and similar - are already rejected when seeking free legal advice and legal assistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">The municipality's legal services, which are already overstretched, are ready to make further cuts.</seg>
<seg id="5">As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30% of their federal funds.</seg>
<seg id="6">The director of Queesland James Farrell's community centres said that the latest survey of the National Association of Local Authorities revealed that thousands of people are already being dismissed every year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the German Government's decision to repeal it.</seg>
<seg id="8">He said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People who leave violent relationships, people with incalculable and depressing debts, families that go through divisions, workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems, and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of June 2017, the Federal Government will cut funding by 30%, meaning that thousands of people in need of help from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We call on the Federal Attorney General and the Federal Minister of Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to immediately lift these budget cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, the government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is now time to look at the needs of local authorities and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump accused of pulling weapons</seg>
<seg id="2">New York - Donald Trump's campaign has been indicted for alleged inaction, having been told that her campaign leader for North Carolina directed a firearm to an employee in February, while they were on a jeep in February.</seg>
<seg id="3">The incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent Bordini in the Charlotte Regional Court on Wednesday, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bordini indicated that he waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that "this would not happen."</seg>
<seg id="5">The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drew a gun, put his right finger on the withdrawal, and rammed the race in Vincents Kniekehle," said Bordini in his charge.</seg>
<seg id="6">After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini found that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he announced in the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate unleashed a revolt when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - firearms owners and weapons friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and judges appointed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had pulled his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bordini's complaint requires damages from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and Philip for injury to body and permanent seelic damage.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trump's press spokesperson Hope Hicks was not in favour of an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="12">Attempts to contact Philip also failed.</seg>
<seg id="13">WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="14">No response has been given to calls from its consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far conducted a controversial campaign.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).</seg>

<seg id="1">Berlin / Schwerin: Survey on country elections: SPD and CDU lose</seg>
<seg id="2">The upcoming elections in the LÃ¤nder of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18) show significant losses for the ruling parties SPD and CDU.</seg>
<seg id="3">This was demonstrated by representative surveys by the INSA opinion research institute for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition in the north could run just a little further, this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both LÃ¤nder, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to lead the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD dropped from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24%.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the poll, the party would only be close to the CDU, which could return to 23%.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would be 19% (formerly 18.4%), and AfD would be represented for the first time in Landtag at 19%.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Greens, despite slight losses of 6% (previously 8.7%), are returning to Schweriner Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP would not be represented on Landtag at 3% each.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the poll, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) would only be 23% (2011: 28.3%).</seg>
<seg id="13">CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">It would be 19% for the Greens (17.6% for 2011), but 15% for the left (11.7% for now).</seg>
<seg id="15">The AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Deputies at 14%.</seg>
<seg id="16">With 5%, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entry in 2011.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone</seg>
<seg id="2">E-mail and Internet in Zeitlupe: 20 years ago Nokia Communicator entered the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today, the successors dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device was almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty knowledgeable.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would now be enough for about two high resolution selffies.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Nokia 9000 Communicator came into business exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet, but they are somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an "office in the western pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could achieve a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was to reach the Communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could predict in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then, things have changed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The cellular phone business of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster and was finally sold and processed to Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the market is dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Being always online, this is today for many people everyday.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some 1.4 billion devices were sold, of which 555 million are owned by Samsung and Apple.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales of the equipment are about EUR 400 billion.</seg>
<seg id="29">This includes the well-being of the numerous app providers and telecommunications companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">A whole industry has developed around the smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple's chief Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhones at the Mac World.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: A music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, everything easy to use by touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple's winning move began, and today the iPhone is the group's most important product.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the afterthought.</seg>
<seg id="35">She finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung now have the say.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">On average every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We must all learn to get rid of the smartphone," said Janina Kugel, in the Siemens Board of Directors responsible for staff.</seg>
<seg id="40">Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this was the biggest attraction Heathrows, just as we did in London in 2012, when we made a huge effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">This will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local and business people near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will hide on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he has asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not individual.</seg>
<seg id="12">Enlargement is a way of creating up to 180,000 new jobs, Â£211 billion in economic growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a Â£11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program into time and budget, from the T5 - which was elected as the world's best airport terminal for five years, to the T2, built in the middle of the world's two most frequented runways.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third run, which is supported by Â£16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" on display blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">For companies that make money with online advertising, one of the software manufacturers is trying to circumvent ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockages on its desktop, Adblock Plus released a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding of its ads to make it more difficult to recognize ads about which part of the page is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a Blogpost, Adblock Ben Williams's spokesman wrote that "this kind of Hin and Her struggle between the timeless Open Source community and the bypasses has been underway since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying advertisers have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide, according to a study carried out last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use ad blockers; almost four times as much 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84% of advertising revenue.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company does not have an impact on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram.</seg>
<seg id="11">Advertising on desktop PCs represents a sufficient share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth investing such a move.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preference tool" to give people more control over advertising targeted at them.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Facebook claimed that adblocks would be worrying about new filters, because they would block content on the site that is not advertising.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem," said a Facebook spokesman in an email message.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ad blockers are a blunt means, so instead we have focused on development tools such as ad preferences to put more control in people's hands.</seg>

<seg id="5">A woman put herself on the streets in the dark "in an act of despair" and were hit by several cars, said the police in Waadt.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 who was overrun by several vehicles, including a lorry, wanted to kill himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police who are asking them and any witnesses to the incident to report themselves.</seg>
<seg id="9">An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, and Gilles Hofstetter informed the Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="11">Could a collision be avoided?</seg>
<seg id="12">That is something the prosecutor has to decide, "said Hofstetter.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers would not have to assume that a pedestrian would run on the motorway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a policeman of negligent killing was acquitted after she had overrun and killed a man who was near Payerne in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, took the court.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the policist -- who responded to an emergency call -- went in a justified way, and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," said the judge.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has further information about the incident near Morges on Thursday should contact the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.</seg>

<seg id="1">NASA Climate Model: Venus was once habitable</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus, with its hot, water-free surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, could once have shown earth-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists previously suggested that the slow change of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and that it was slowly moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house lives and protect against rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30% matt.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In the Giss model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side of the sun for almost two months," explained Giss Scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which looks like a rain umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, the Venus -- over several billion years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans darkened and their water vapour was burnt away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a lethal greenhouse effect remained - the Venus that we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche and cited too little participation in the decision-making process of the team.</seg>
<seg id="3">Alternatively President / General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately seek a new trainer.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said Roy, 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="5">During the summer I thought long and long about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, this it needs and bring it to a higher level.</seg>
<seg id="6">In order to achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="7">He must also have a right of participation in decisions that affect the performance of the team.</seg>
<seg id="8">These conditions are not being met at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sakic, who launched Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Patrick informed me today about this decision," said Sakic.</seg>
<seg id="11">We all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">Roy was awarded the league's best coach for the Avalanches 2013-14 during his debut season.</seg>
<seg id="13">He led the club to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Playoffs of Minnesota and missed the post-season in each of the last two years.</seg>

<seg id="2">Labor struggles over pay for North Sea workers are suspended, while all the parties to the dispute are standing up for a new round of talks, said negotiators.</seg>
<seg id="3">Strikes against Wood Group, the oil field service provider, were carried out sporadically on North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to reopen the resolution process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will hold some full-day meetings in the coming weeks which will start early next year to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trade unions said that their last strike, the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.</seg>
<seg id="7">This year Wood Group cut rates to its North Sea counterparties by around 9% due to negative market pressure.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company's reduction follows a 10% reduction for onshore contractors in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said that additional cuts give the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shell has laid off thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it rationalises its activities as a result of its mega-merger with the UK energy company BG Group.</seg>
<seg id="11">Energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that was exacerbated by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with workers' leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest industrial disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just few," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion over the last five years.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the Plejads.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate to different rates in the star clusters and in what context the rotation periods are linked to the planetary creation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The archaeological site of the Plejaden lies 445 light years from Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this clubhouse, created around 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">You are now turning quickly.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates, these mature stars emit large amounts of stars.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a dampening effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When an asterisk is ageing, its rotation rate begins to slow.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star, such as sunshades.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In the" Ballet "of the Plejaden we see that slow Rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster Rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the star clusters of the Plejads are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The star clusters of Plejaden offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still a lot to be learned about, such as how, when, and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang their "dance shoes."</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the reddening rates of Plejaden, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="1">A controversial baseball star disappears</seg>
<seg id="2">The tears were at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in the best days from Base to Base.</seg>
<seg id="3">After his emotional resignation announcement, on August 12, the 41-year-old professional against the Tampa Bay Rays will wear the triangle of his New York Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-minute All-Star Game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).</seg>
<seg id="6">In 2009, Rodriguez won the World Series with the Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="7">His signature under a ten-year contract earned him $27 million annually since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will become an adviser and youth coach - with full pay.</seg>
<seg id="9">When players paid back Rodriguez for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), the Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and since 2005 he has made some milestones.</seg>
<seg id="11">With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the 41-year-old may not be admitted to the baseball's fame hall.</seg>
<seg id="13">For so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was in the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.</seg>
<seg id="14">As early as 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" admitted having taken away prohibited steroids between 2001 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013, he was imprisoned for 211 matches due to the involvement of the so-called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez is considered to have received funding for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a dispute the lock was reduced to 162 meetings.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The League could even have done me a favour for 2014, because I played through 20 years without pause," said Rodriguez at the time.</seg>
<seg id="19">His days of farewell are not silent either.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends have once again got the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.</seg>
<seg id="21">"My job does not include a farewell tour."</seg>
<seg id="22">"My job involves trying to win each game," said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.</seg>
<seg id="23">After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and who is told about the relationship with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from fans of Yankee Archrival Boston Red Sox.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We want A-Rod," the followers sang at the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Learn: Due to a positive doping test, the weight theber Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A knowledgeable athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases became known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish thunderstorm Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - just before the start of the already critically angry athletics competitions, these news come at an intime.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last Sunday in Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazid was detected, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had won the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have taken part in the talks over 50 m Freistil.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen has asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B sample and to have a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations," said Xinhua in a Communication: "We will work with the International Sports Court (CAS) and will accept the judgment."</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctions against athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also on the night of Rio, the news about the positive sample at Danekowa was sickened by 33-year-olds themselves.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said to the Bulgarian TV channel BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements,"</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance is EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-Probe was already positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I do not understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all thieves from the chronically doping-prone nation may not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case of Adrian Zielinski was also known, the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was tested positively for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier as his brother Tomasz.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both contend for the purchase, but they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the athlete starts, the Danekowa case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF World Federation had banned the entire Russian team from taking off with the exception of systematic doping, and Kenya has also produced many bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming sports, the earlier offences in China also caused intense clashes between athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">For example, the Frenchman Camille Lacourt harshly attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"When I see the podium over 200 m Freistil, I want to hand over," said Lacourt on French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focus of a discussion with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun had been tested positively at China's championships in 2014 for the Trimetazidin stimulation, but had to sit down for a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data Dog: So perfide blackmail hackers</seg>
<seg id="2">Developers of blackmail malware currently target companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware defence specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany, 40% of the companies surveyed have been at least once, in part several times, victims of an attack with Erpresser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20% of companies were already the target of ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40% of the victims willingly paid the lion's money requested by the perpetrators in order to be able to reuse the systems and data that were attacked.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Malwarebytes "observations, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks on corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful, the potentially extortionating lion's money will be much higher than private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are currently seeing a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in talks with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most malware programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the shift to company attacks has been made terribly fast in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it looks specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, and archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and permanently delete the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Afterwards, the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where private users are at stake in the personal photo database, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production will stop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is higher if a Ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22% of German companies concerned reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13% had to interrupt business completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We always say to the victims: Does not pay, it only promotes the problem," says Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80-90% of companies that pay get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">Managers find it difficult to reject the perpetrators "demands in the face of deadlock in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hackers, in turn, know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined user areas and contact with the blacksmiths and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to collect more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims via chat how to pay via Bitcoin, set up or decrypt free support websites.</seg>
<seg id="26">And when private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware about a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software module to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware themselves, advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Included in the package is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blacksmiths then look for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log into one of the forums in the underground, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Usually the criminals then commission spammers to spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that are better able to protect their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50% of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust in being able to resist Ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful retrieval, the perpetrators risk publishing sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the damage potential much higher than before depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could also put completely new targets on the Internet of Things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hacker Conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how to control a thermostat connected to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such a blocked heating may well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become an issue in the industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and customizable</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: A little SUV, a little coupÃ© and also the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, is really very flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not work closely at all.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well processed and have a pleasant effect. Only the cockpit upper side falls slightly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than similar vehicles in the storage room.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only is there a boot of 453 l available for elevated and 1026 l for wrapped backrest, but there are the Magic Seats.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: The rear bench seats can be mounted like a kettle and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the ground to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot can be loaded well, but the loading height at 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">But he is likely to do his job a little quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another motorization: A 1.5 l petrol tank with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, steering should be a little more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment does not leave any wishes open in the tested top version "Executive."</seg>
<seg id="19">The security systems include the City emergency brake wizard (working up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the gauge support.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote light wizard works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent tempo controller responds to the traffic mark recognition and reduces the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is available only for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and HDMI-booths are under the armrest and can therefore be easily reached.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 20000 euros and diesel from 23000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the motorway</seg>
<seg id="2">There is regular dust on the bypass - here is a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this is to change: The legal service provider should be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all car drivers who are on the road every night when driving over the motorway (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The state-owned road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between Hammer StraÃe and Weseler StraÃe exit by 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then turn right directly from Hammer StraÃe.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage is that traffic is spread at an early stage, improving the overall process on the much-travelled section of the Bundesstrasse 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had been presented by the CDU Group in the district representation MÃ¼nster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">Car drivers are particularly nervous between 17 and 19: 00.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the back stau reaches the bridge over the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason is the needle clock on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler StraÃe.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, traffic is only passing through the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be rebuilt well over three quarters years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason for this is that static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the necessary capacity to absorb heavy goods traffic twice.</seg>
<seg id="15">How long this bottleneck and the associated daily congestion will last, cannot be said by the competent local company.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, years can be expected: The bridge has an official remaining service life up to 2034.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the extension of the legal service provider, the state-owned company deliberately chose the weaker time in school holidays because there are obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="18">The traffic is passing by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Restful Night: Tips on sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you walk eternally, at night you are waking up for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep well before the wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is far from recovering.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, such problems are in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than 10% feel that their sleep is often or permanently unrecoverable.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders arise?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on a variety of causes, says Hans-GÃ¼nter WeeÃ, member of the Executive Board of the German Society for Schlafforschung and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, what one understands by land is the insomnia, that is to say an intrusion and spill.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is precisely what many people feel is unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Board of Directors of the German House Medical Association, with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">This can be based on organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also on medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Often, sleep disturbance is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Very early awakening is especially common in a depression," says WeeÃ.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors are interdependent.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a tape discard, you can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours, and perhaps start to shake about everyday problems and concerns, you'll find your way.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights per week and who are affected by the day should go to the doctor, advise WeeÃ.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look very different: One is locked, tired, unloaded, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve sleep disturbances, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or even drugs - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Established sleeping mediators hardly exist in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietzen, head of the interdisciplinary slaughterhouse of the CharitÃ© UniversitÃ¤t Medizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleep problems, you should first contact the doctor, advise WeeÃ.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the sleeping laboratory and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, medical doctors recommend using snoring with respiratory agents, with sickening daily fatigue, sleeping transmitters, or if you don't find the cause of a breakdown, Fietzen explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not really necessary to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Just don't take lunch sleep," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After strolling, you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, you carry a nose glasses, a breast belt and a fan on your finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">Moreover, a camera on the ceiling captures the sleeping ends.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get to grips with the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of position screws on which you can start a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is important to note that regular sleep and rest periods, not too long in bed, do not sleep in the day, do not watch TV to sleep, avoid alcohol and watch out for the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that is completely unhelpful.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former German swimmer Markus Deibler commented on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis via Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he first collected gold at the World Short-Snow Championships in Doha, while also putting up his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Deibler on Facebook protected himself from his ex-team colleagues who were criticised.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 â¬award and a jungle King 150,000 â¬should no one be surprised by missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old at night on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="6">The support system for swimming sports is bad, but doping controls are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">This will not enable us to compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely or even operate on the issue of doping.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I am not saying that controls should be stopped here," he added.</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be notified nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few left-wing trees, in the middle, still a few headquarters: Rigaer StraÃe in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at first glance, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you walk from the east to the west, you will pass by playgrounds, a freshly cut kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone sprayed on the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a lidl, which is soon to be demolished, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, articles about this "trendy district," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, are mainly illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house number 94: Once occupied, residents now have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator Henkel, in particular, has repeatedly argued in favour of a police crackdown on the project, calling the area "no-go zone" for police officers and 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After, on 22 June, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police patrolled official statements for three weeks, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground, blocked parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime the rooms were renovated on behalf of the unknown owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the evacuation had been illegal, and one day later police and construction workers withdrew under the anguish of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street works peacefully: Parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about spÃ¤ti.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is a primary school and kindergarten nearby.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, are above all generalized by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern about increasing rent and genetic modification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a jaw that the majority wanted to secure police protection from vandalizing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The tomb that the Berlin interior senator and the police set up between house leaders and their neighbors does not seem to exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working district, which still has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990 many houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainz street near Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While Mainz had been cleared in a real street battle under a large police force, many of the Rigaer projects were legalised and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and election connoisseurs from all over the world: With them, residents of the GDR and former house occupiers now share their pines.</seg>
<seg id="21">This can also be seen in the case of renting, which since 2009 has increased by almost 60% for new renting.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols of this development: They are recognized by shelves or newly cut facades, which have been beaten with colours.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road has been mentioned so often this year, along with the words' left-wing violence '.</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: Crimes such as personal injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are damage to property, which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house for 17 years next to the controversial 94, there can be no question of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is reassuring: The people of 94 are their neighbours, who have certainly not been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more with each other than anywhere else."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has consciously moved to Rigaer StraÃe - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important for the residents to get back to their streets: The police, the politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the power of interpretation over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But, in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: By reckless new buildings in former building blocks, which drive away the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"After all, these are real estate properties that are not of interest to many here - here people who are not so well looked after live," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I absolutely cannot endorse violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if someone never hears?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for zugezogenes who are annoyed by colour bombs: The house projects and the left scene were part of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="38">If you are travelling, you should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a pub area can complain badly about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organisation.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a local social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Social Pedagogist supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact point for all actors: Refugees, refugee workers, administration, authorities and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group suggests that honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is now here, the icing Wollmilchsau, which has a particular problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some - rather than appeasing but targeting the multitude of tasks - meant that the administration wanted to publish the post.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administrative specialist was sought with a talent for languages and people, together with a long experience in the field of social work, just an illuminating Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, working with local people and also behind the scenes and networking activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been present for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50% share for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It was high time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and principal players.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are major and small problems, organisational, human and contractual problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be on WasenstraÃe</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees that have been recognised.</seg>
<seg id="18">Local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate refugees in their own or rented homes.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility varies from country council to community and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find private housing.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it has not worked, but it depends on private apartments, says Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, communal housing must be seized, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So new containers will soon be installed in WasenstraÃe.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only apartments are not enough.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to permanent jobs, they are traineeships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants who need to be frozen or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"More seats would be good," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the Bauhof or help house managers, do non-profit work - and that is motivated and very orderly, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that work for the community will have a positive external impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">However, activity is not just work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People should develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there is a need for sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here too, administration and honorary officials are involved.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain to refugees that it takes time and that they can reasonably bridge the gap, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Anyone who at some point feels that he can help no one in Urbach should not work, and that he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, there are also problems, customers say honestly, "people who don't work at all."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: Are the two, following recent events, afraid of radicalisation, including in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"No," Regine customer says very clearly, "what some might call naÃ¯ve." A residual risk could and would not exclude it.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already aware.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also the subject of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would fear that the attackers would completely discredit them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"They want to show that they have nothing to do with this," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So primary and honorary officials on the ground and in the region must look for activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have a background in which a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">In fact, it is unfair to put them on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="60">"We have not yet arrived in Urbach where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would ease the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that Urbacher is already using it to integrate the existing people properly.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must be helped, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
