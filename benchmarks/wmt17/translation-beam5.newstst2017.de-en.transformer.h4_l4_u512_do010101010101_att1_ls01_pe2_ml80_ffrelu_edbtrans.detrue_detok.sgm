<seg id="2">A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead at the stairwell of a local shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="3">The victim's brother said he can't imagine anyone wanting to harm him, "Endean went uphill with him again."</seg>
<seg id="4">The corpse found Wednesday morning at Westfield Mall was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the forensic department said in San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="5">The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classed as a murder and the investigation is on the running.</seg>
<seg id="6">The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef in Boston, had earned his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Our thoughts and condolences are with Franks family and friends at this difficult time.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louis Galicia admitted that Frank was initially living in hostels, but that, "things finally went uphill for him."</seg>
<seg id="11">"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.</seg>
<seg id="12">Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was a friendly person with a great heart.</seg>
<seg id="14">Combining his way with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us dinner, "Louis Galicia said.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was the brother who swam with the electricity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"With everything going wrong in the world, he was this unsung diamond that lit brightly every day," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone with information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD Hinweistelefon under the case number 415-575-4444.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's what the Hollywood star has now made unmistakably clear in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I'm always put in drawers or getting glued up from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and reality."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I myself don't have the desire to always be perfect and successful."</seg>
<seg id="6">"To be honest, these things are more snub to me."</seg>
<seg id="7">Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at her being considered "Miss Perfect," as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan."</seg>
<seg id="8">After all, the actress likes to spend her time at home, front TV with loose debris and Mexican food, the magazine says.</seg>
<seg id="9">To whitewash, they ask about the child's wish: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be complete," according to the Hollywood Star.</seg>
<seg id="10">In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.</seg>

<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer searched with some colleagues a bit of a change with an exit on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chio: 'Golden sports pyramid' for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes, the horses recalled their holidays, they joked in the fast gallop home to the fodder trunks.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometre at that pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It wasn't a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the riding careers ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was back near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was guided with his family through the complex of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't swore for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid provided the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sports pyramid in a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sympathetic athlete is not lacking in awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverwaltskreuz, Silver Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already admonished him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first winner Hans GÃ¼nter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"This award means a lot to me," Langer says, "because it is awarded not only for sporting success but also for social engagement."</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades Langer has been promoting offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros equal.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. Masterchef was inducted into the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among the most popular are the Athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Facts Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wishavard.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the official part, the illustrious society migrated to Springstadion, where the Lavazza prize ran.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trump's economic policies compared: It's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want it.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are divided on fiscal and energy policy and on a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a more fundamental and philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep that in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can hurt the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to steer the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be very different, Trump claims.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will see regulations go back massively, and he is pushing for sweeping tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, by contrast, says the state has certain tasks to do, he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for that.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">This must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate announces even the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strongly opposed, for example, by the state-run Teaparty wing of Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So Trump could still have partisan discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal production back into the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is also expected to be possible in previously protected areas, and the Paris Climate Change Agreement aims to terminate it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, by contrast, explicitly wants to expand renewable energy with her investment program and calls for "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the Trans-Pacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, say, Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: Once he says that the minimum wage has to go out, he says he cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more about the fiscal policies of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics maintain that this would only increase the budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes, and whose critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: 'Every fled woman has experience of sexual violence'</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One put her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curious in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table plate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she realizes she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene acts normally.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is a division manager of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance services in Bavaria, and is also involved in the issue of women fleeing.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fled.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich's north in one of the few decentralized shelters for single women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs established the facility along with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has recently been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sixty people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men don't exist - nor as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman on the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It's not exaggerated to say: Every woman who arrives here has had experience of sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they face torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a means of hope," she told them.</seg>
<seg id="24">For women, other reasons for the flight outweigh: "Many are secretly stealing it because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have made experience of sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">It continues.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, that continues.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The fact that Schlepper, for example, calls for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believes that the end, once they arrive in Germany, is mistaken, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here, single women in refugee shelters would often be seen as inferior and at worst abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">As a result, about 90 percent of women living in accommodation in Munich's north are traumatised, she estimates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Some of the children certainly haven't been voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so used to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Or they don't trust to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">As they often don't help, it takes more accommodation only for them, demands Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">The question of whether they knew about a project similar to that in Munich, some answer no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia, women alone are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press secretary of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Unter- und Mittelfranken there are floors or own houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the committee, it said: "It is very important for men and women to be housed separately."</seg>
<seg id="45">"If privacy is missing or if men and women are housed together, violence against women can occur - continuously -."</seg>
<seg id="46">In particular, washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, the study states.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much women feel about this need for protection can be read on the journey to the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Since getting around that it gives us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make up a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputies have called on their union to approve new work-fighting measures in their disputes over a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire council to approve more work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said ministers had agreed to respond to concerns about the treaty.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, the chairman of JDC Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently calm" about problems, leading to the contract being rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "In light of this, the JDC Board voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and called for official renegotiation on all of your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating work-fighting that begins in early September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes resulted in assistant doctors contending six times this year, the first overall shortfall in NHS history.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of BMA assistant physician Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of contract recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">He told BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be forcibly introduced for doctors in England.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: An "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaders of Russia and Turkey met Tuesday to give hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg's Palace, I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles were shameful and he had little warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report a whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a sustained cooler emitted by Putin showed that Russia's leader had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: The firing of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's response at the time was shaky.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offense was even bigger as it was committed by a would-be friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the veto will be difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unfettered attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious were accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He vehemently denied that.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin was given the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book some kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs, first and foremost, all the friends he can get after he was nearly left behind in a failed coup last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly banning charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has fallen by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti put it: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had added political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it regards its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the ongoing grudge about the snail-up of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for elected state bodies after the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray one, as an analyst once described to me, "Alliance of outsiders": Two countries that are in breach of the West and feel badly treated and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yet, despite public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be indicative that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents testified at the press conference that they had not even stripped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator on Syria can be found.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better for the two heads of state to talk again at least.</seg>

<seg id="2">The RBS brand is expected to be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="3">Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank has distanced itself since then when it almost collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">At this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end-consumer finance brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">She supported international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she has chosen to focus more national brands.</seg>
<seg id="9">Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the IPO will switch to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller brands for retail banking, which will receive more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we now become more a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say now that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with customers under these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It's time for us to become the bank of the brands, because how do we focus inside (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" Said the chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you'll see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can land these brands again, so I think the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dettori spun champagne after a double at Newmarket, bringing him 3,000th win</seg>
<seg id="3">Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He put on predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local circuit with his second win of the night a milestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">The three-time winner, Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before that, said: "It's something special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I'm very emotional because my family is here too</seg>
<seg id="9">I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am relieved and very modest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori takes the jubilation as he picks up victory on predilection</seg>
<seg id="13">Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who scored more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derbysieger had 4,493 career victories</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey in modern times and it's no surprise he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma have been thrilling fans for years for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he'd already fetched 6,000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and big-tournament jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has already won nearly 30 years in GB, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From Flying finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat rink for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was annoying.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorenough Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago, he initially had trouble when he returned from his six-month ban, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to deflect his doubts and return to his best form.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he's far from the end - Dettori has said earlier that he wants to continue in competitions up to his least 50.th year of life.</seg>

<seg id="10">About his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state on draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">That move has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works like he did for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As chief of staff, he was one of the country's most powerful men.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff was resigning on their own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of some sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man once touted as a potential president, at one time, wants to guide Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me to this very complicated post - you could almost say - arduous posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was deputy prime minister and defense minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once thought that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term Putin had breached the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But that post was taken by another, approaching ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now linked to Fife</seg>
<seg id="2">The Â£1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have linked the Queensferry Crossings to the Viaduct - meaning the bridge is now linked to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closures of the "cover blowers" that are approaching completion around each of the bridge's three towers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Fife's bridge cut is now 600 feet long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 milling ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Â£1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economic Minister Keith Brown today visited the building site and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "This is an historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses to an engineering work of a truly epic extent to this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the pin.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of the total bridge torches in their place and the final section of the ceiling gets a bed shot for the deck in Rosyth today, meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in any bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the conclusion represents forward-looking high and deep construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection to the North Tower deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the North or Country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern entrance bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at a rate of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances to which the team is working were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres.</seg>
<seg id="20">Fortunately, everything was very good.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck at 13: 20 BST alert on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.</seg>
<seg id="4">The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We saw how the boat turned near it and faced us the worst," said the head of Moelfre Vince Jones's rescue station.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach until we left to water," he added.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two of the men were rescued from a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a Boje without a lifeboat.</seg>
<seg id="8">They all arrived aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens think that investors should be much more committed in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">At the next Council meeting, the SPD proposes a "good governance concept."</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">There has been no regulation.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, 20% of all apartments will have to be classified as social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can also be found in the stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the big talking point at City Hall is, Bratmann said: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"We want investors on such land to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of housing as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing funding program that will cost millions and still needs to be funded is intended to provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, Bratmann said: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, according to Bratmann, the situation in the housing market is worsening.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not complete: The approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of another around 1300 cheap apartments whose promotion will expire over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, it will be 500 homes.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent that, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expiring ties should now be bought from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">It would also have to be considered to get homes back into price fixing.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the Western City deadlines expire at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some 1800 apartments could be put back into price fixing for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Just: That doesn't want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">After all, the number of social housing in the western city is again dramatically increased, from the destination of so-called mingling.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social weakness in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Group chairman Holger Herlitschke thinks: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be on the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">They have focused on more building sites for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean is that a compromise cannot be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">PokÃ©mon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play but rather prefer to spend their spare time staring at screens has been lamented by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">Time on screen was initially on TV, then limited to video games and most recently to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am referring, of course, to the PokÃ©mon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest fell somewhat ahead of the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market entry in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days, PokÃ©mon Go had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go out with their smartphones and look for PokÃ©mons to be tracked with a GPS and, once found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when it was even younger joined the polls and jumped for the search from the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person resets every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracked 35,000 users, told The Washington Post recently that within two days of market launch of the game, the number of tracked people training 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays PokÃ©mon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance improvement.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to "take 30 minutes of time," "get off the sofa" and "be active every day" encountered deaf ears because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look elastic.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yet the importance of sport cannot be overstated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly drive sport reduce their chances of contracting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of PokÃ©mon Go is that it will get people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships in the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are mural playmakers who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track down our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will wane over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with activism in the real world, helping many people hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all that.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the ankle.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now, finally, Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American Turner succumbed to the multicampaign title on Thursday, widening the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">American-born Simone Biles is touring on the Sweet beams during the women's individual multi-campaign in the art tournament at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-campaign title and overall the fifth while solidifying her reputation for being the best of her generation, or even ever.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Mary Lou rescue team said of her that she is "the best turnaround I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">They expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that didn't go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between it and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold would be seen as a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman huddled after each won gold and silver in the women's single multistage competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles picked up the first medal Tuesday while on the farewell celebration of the retired team co-ordinator Martha Karolyi as an exclamation mark.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted that during her long walk to the top, never planned the future, that's not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their ground exercises - which include their typical tumbling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">She has not lost a multi-match contest since the summer of 2013, a winning series that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina was easily led by two turns, the picture faltered.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swebebebees and Bodenturns - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She picked up again with 15,433 on the limb - and put one on it with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman gently embraced her as she awaited her final gift - a mere formality - and tears poured on Biles shiny red, white and blue Eyeliner when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">Raismans' performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when they struggled for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, dubbed "Oma" by Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground practice, she threw up the audience of clothes, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly expanding tweet of 19-year-olds from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:</seg>

<seg id="1">Police: 3 victims shot in serial killings while listening to music in car</seg>
<seg id="2">According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial killings while they were in the car and listening to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">Police said that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery since the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to become a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed and two others wounded in nine attacks, mainly in Hispanic residential areas within four months.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators declined to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks are linked and were committed by the same killer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and later died.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah still died locally.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and hear music.</seg>
<seg id="14">Authorities also released a police report on the shootings, aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed it was the serial killer's work.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found cartridges and secured a bullet from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.</seg>

<seg id="2">Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.</seg>
<seg id="3">But like the least of his peers, Edmund has microzephalie, the result of a genetic disorder about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="4">When he first came home, my first thought was I didn't do that.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't do that.</seg>
<seg id="6">I did not accept that.</seg>
<seg id="7">What's not true at all -- of course, you got stuck to it, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="9">Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize it.</seg>
<seg id="10">"My first answer was' I didn't know people were still doing, '" Picciuto explained.</seg>
<seg id="11">Edmund can run with the help of a paycheck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Edmund could not sit or cope until his third year of life, and he still cannot speak.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he is slowly making progress.</seg>
<seg id="14">He can run with support and bike driving.</seg>
<seg id="15">He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.</seg>

<seg id="17">"We bring him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it's not a typical sign language -- she says, Edmund invented some characters alone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Microzephalie has a variety of causes: Genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="20">Symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zikavirus.</seg>
<seg id="22">Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.</seg>
<seg id="23">I constantly asked what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="24">What will happen?</seg>
<seg id="25">And she still doesn't really know.</seg>
<seg id="26">I haven't asked for the forecast for a long time because I don't expect it to really tell me someone.</seg>
<seg id="27">But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's getting better.</seg>
<seg id="29">You know it will get better for you.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rains and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare the emergency on Friday, with more rainfall expected throughout Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and the south of the Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rains, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">Louisiana's governor, John Bel Edwards, told state officials that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help with affected communities is already on the way.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Prepareth, announced that requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were multiplying.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that the community of Tangipahoa alone had requested 10 thousand sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood alert system will be deployed across much of southern Louisiana by Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service revealed that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">A flood warning system was deployed in southern Alabamas on Friday while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both of which are in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">Metereologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said a low-power flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas over the passing rivers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The River Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still added people from floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in southwest Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued Friday near Gloster.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose sharply overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said he had warned another stepson living nearby.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We woke up and the water was pouring and pouring in," Hansford said.</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years in which she lived there, she had never seen such a high altitude of the river.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said Nothelfer had rescued all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed by Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said the flooding had "spread rapidly" as there continued to be heavy rains and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said the ground had been significantly depleted by the rains since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities said severe rains and street flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and tuition shortfall in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa gave up 200 flooded homes.</seg>
<seg id="28">Residents have been evacuated to two churches, now both of which have been flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The front-runner of the community of Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets strapped from flooding.</seg>
<seg id="30">Emergency shelters have been set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to host the evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Once the water starts to go back, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen roads were closed due to flooding and sandbags were provided to residents hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"The last major flooding we had was in March," Lacy Landrum said of the City Council.</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississipp, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Countys said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his claims, a handful of homes were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported until now.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it still comes."</seg>

<seg id="2">Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week, the second time a 6-year-old child is being shot.</seg>
<seg id="3">The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.</seg>
<seg id="4">The grandparents said Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the running, leg, arm and stomach, but that he was in consciousness at his transport to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He went through a lot, his little body was shattered by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.</seg>
<seg id="6">I just can't believe that.</seg>
<seg id="7">The boy's condition was considered critical at a hospital and he had to undergo multiple operations.</seg>
<seg id="8">The boy's family told the broadcaster that he is expected to regenerate.</seg>
<seg id="9">He should have started first class in a local elementary school.</seg>
<seg id="10">Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also shot were three men: Two aged 29 and a 32-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The boy was shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, the station reported.</seg>
<seg id="14">The other two victims were not in the car and police were just investigating whether one of the offenders' wounded men could be.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that apparently there was a crossfire between multiple shooter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cartridges for assault rifles tracked back to various assault rifles outpaced the scene.</seg>
<seg id="17">It seems that this has clearly been an ongoing struggle.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the street, on both sides of the sidewalk, hulls were found.</seg>
<seg id="19">So there seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved, "police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told police in Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="20">Several homes and vehicles have also been hit in the area.</seg>
<seg id="21">No arrests were made and police are currently reviewing the surveillance video.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I imagine under the women's Olympic squad in the Turn and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three Turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and who rounds out Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflecting the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among the female Turner has been an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multicampaign event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We're seeing the top of this sport, but so don't look like turnclasses across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same path as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympics will have only four Turner players in the team, and last year's Marta Karolyi is the coach.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turns is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gyms, sustained by parents who pay for training, instruction, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their Turner and Families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround clubs are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, Turner will receive all their training and this is a costly and long-term commitment for the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the Turn.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to enable the communities of many young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have a more efficient and accessible gym.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turnstication of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality tournaments to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of this team that will get thousands of young girls to be interested in the turnaround and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team gold and thanking her so many young girls with different background motivated to start their way to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant doctors want to organize more strikes after they rejected Jeremy hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected it.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the contract and said the NHS would be in a "no-man country" and that any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistant doctors are expected to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend performances to improve care at odd times.</seg>
<seg id="5">DR Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA commander for assistant doctors told reporters last night in a statement: "Assistant doctors have continued to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."</seg>
<seg id="6">At just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes by means of talks met with reluctance from the government, and sometimes with deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">That happened to the one promise Jeremy Hunt made only last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, lift the burst and address the concerns of assistant doctors."</seg>
<seg id="10">Should he not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work-fighting measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">The latest strike in late April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates as nurses and specialist doctors were involved in providing cover to doctors on the strike panel.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 55,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, director general of the NHS staff, urged the assistant doctors to end the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "Labour action is not reaching anything of the few, but is already weighing on overloaded teams and service providers and is only worrying, distress and disruption to patients, punters and their families."</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the past two months, we have spoken to the office of the assistant doctors and responded positively to concerns about precariousness and whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional leave, training crates, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - were a sign of just how serious it was to employers, health education England and the Ministry of Health.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a Â£2-per-day drug after authorities recommended that this more people be administered for an extended period of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The gerinny drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The drug is already administered 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="5">NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by assemblies of fatty material in the arterial walls that form sieges.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the Belag breaks apart, it can cause a blood cloth that clocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">If the blood clan solves, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another one.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and is marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces that risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">NICE's draft guidance, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">Fear of another heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes among people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness reveals electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on charges of corruption</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political correctness has meant that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a damning government report revealed today.</seg>
<seg id="4">Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is verbally attacking police, election observers and town hall officials for ignoring evidence of voter abuse due to "over-sensitivity to ethnie and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former minister for integration and local government, who is now an AntCorruption clerk, said that intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shutters outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have an ID card to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter has to name and address only.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report suggests that unremote ink should be attached to a person's finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should be given more protection, Sir Eric says.</seg>
<seg id="10">It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official commits or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in east London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be included in the corrupt and illegal practices of his office after a litany.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman had "perverted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have "run his campaign on the basis that it is the relentless duty of Muslims to choose it."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">In particular, he expressed alarm at the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including leading ID cards to prove identity</seg>
<seg id="20">His report said: "As evidence has been made available, pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, particularly communities with Pakistani or Bangladesky background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There were concerns that... state institutions knowingly ignored such behaviour because of" politically correct "oversensitivity to ethnie and religion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing briefing papers to stop "election harvests."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters about your ID before the election.</seg>
<seg id="25">Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she cast her vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews of a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible for election.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists edit full briefings and envelopes of briefing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Give police the power to set up shutdowns around election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A legislative amendment that facilitates a charge of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Photography ban in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in election stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensifying training to make sure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal complaint was made after the Tower Hamlet case.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unresponsive because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty on the basis of a number of grounds, in accordance with the high standards in criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticizes the ineffective "Abhak controls" of the town hall's election registration departments.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">Our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud legacy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this reputation.</seg>

<seg id="2">Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have been out of bounds this week over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proved to be an impressive double-hitter of the Duchess of Cambridge.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is by far not the only one to give gold-fighting athlete his own famous double-hitter - at least not if you are allowed to believe social media.</seg>
<seg id="4">In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that currently flick on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians showing more than just some resemblance to Hollywood famous.</seg>
<seg id="5">The hunter and the wolf: Man member of the U.S. team in the archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood</seg>
<seg id="6">Apart from Kate's double-hitter on the cycling track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archery of the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio might be.</seg>
<seg id="7">The team's team member in the archery Brady Ellison has caused a rush on Twitter after images on which he looks scary similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the archery got the madness in the social media and admitted he's already been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I myself don't see much resemblance, with the exception of facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He's a gutsy guy, so I'm probably figuring that out as a compliment."</seg>
<seg id="11">One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will no doubt focus even more this year: The upbeat resemblance between British wide-eyed Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russian Turner Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, is expected to go through as a double-hitter for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.</seg>
<seg id="13">And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to glee star Matthew Morrison for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">A gear higher: This user believes Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor</seg>
<seg id="15">Another lingering comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova points out more than just the sun-baked skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attuned by fans to equal an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."</seg>
<seg id="17">Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes</seg>
<seg id="18">Not the only thing: A Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities</seg>
<seg id="19">Put theory in the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the couple's likeness</seg>
<seg id="20">A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."</seg>
<seg id="21">Indeed, U.S. football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney as well as the gold medal winner at Turn Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile, which resembles that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.</seg>

<seg id="2">Byron MacDonalds analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m freelance school outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypsy Games on Wednesday</seg>
<seg id="3">Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went down like rent" and died during the race like "a pig."</seg>
<seg id="4">The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was switched off when he delivered his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freelance school.</seg>
<seg id="5">Macdonald, who had been taken to CBS's commentator team on board to give more "color," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinesin lost the connection, baby."</seg>
<seg id="6">Too excited, went off like rent, died like a pig.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thank you for that.</seg>
<seg id="8">Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming squad 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to close the gap with China.</seg>
<seg id="9">Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language</seg>
<seg id="10">Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China" like a pig has died "???</seg>
<seg id="11">The idiot did not break that they were still on show. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Ai Yanhan of China was described as follows at the final 4 x 200m freistilswimmel for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, baby."</seg>
<seg id="13">The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, with many speaking to him</seg>
<seg id="14">Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was</seg>
<seg id="15">Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "WoW, # ByronMacDonald.</seg>
<seg id="16">You present the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.</seg>
<seg id="17">A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for the comment from MacDonald and said: "We apologise for having aired the comment about a swimming performance."</seg>

<seg id="22">The network also apologized quickly and issued a notice.</seg>
<seg id="23">We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="24">We quickly apologized to our viewers yesterday night on broadcast and our follow-up in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="25">To clarify one thing, Byron's comments relate to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, they were inappropriate and unhappy, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his comment, saying it was not his intention that it would be interpreted as a personal attack.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's pool at the CBC Olympics, he said.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."</seg>

<seg id="11">She repeated the same with three other underdogs before finally deciding that her nothing fell, pulled back and walked out.</seg>
<seg id="12">"She didn't seem to bother her for watching someone - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underdogs she had tried."</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take underdogs home with someone who had another person and who were not washed up."</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ms Davidson added: "As I got along, the staff tried to pull the garments out of sale after they went - which is just as good."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I would hate to go home with a new couple of underdogs and find out that another woman had them and moved out again and they weren't washed."</seg>
<seg id="17">A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our branch in Folkstone on Tuesday, August 9."</seg>
<seg id="18">All products in question have been pulled out of sale.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to protect yourself from gun attacks with Krav Maga</seg>
<seg id="2">The world out there is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make him something safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you're approaching you from scratch or from behind, this video will show you how you turn the mirror around for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you approach you from behind, you should turn around first so you can see your attacker and "get out of the firing line," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him with the knee and turn it down while the attacker clashes against pain, knock the gun out of his hands.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, seize the gun and turn it around so the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time shift the weight to the gun and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the gun out of his handle before moving backwards and turning the gun on him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi pretends.</seg>
<seg id="12">But remember that in a robbery it is most secure to hand over your money - unless you're a Krav Maga grandmaster.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright slams for a travel guide to his tongue in Europe's dirtiest places</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler underdrew his immune system and stranglehold of a serious test - leaving some of Europe's most dirty and eccentric places.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk snapped his course on a euro ticket, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a sink of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will settle for.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of slipping off the sink of a train toilet already used by thousands of others may be completely repellent, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his trip through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about promoting intestinal batteries as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left him ablaze more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test his intestine's resilience by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railroads to train stations to flushing bags of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told him: "Already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he certainly lived up to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial results showed a luminosity rate of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">By comparison, the luminometers are freshly washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet he refused to let down after their luminosity rate was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial rates in various places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film, he says, "This comes close to the worst I've gotta have in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirty about that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I am not going to touch anything here because it is ecstatic here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which includes both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch while explaining the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstormings that ended up calling "Lass us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in bowel health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom HAKALA, who directed the film, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had raised some of the things I instructed him to leak, just as the eclectic Russian toilet shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to leak them and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents reported mite acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products containing beiged milk acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asozial family left their social home after a dolphin with a damage of Â£50,000 because it had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from her property, shocked employees of the housing community found the property in a irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls pointed to gaping holes, wooden diels were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was slammed to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family have been resettled and it is believed she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the home administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared the apartment was no longer to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in that way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider, since this property will probably be considered not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the home in the meantime and police said that the terror the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive shelling, disputes and floods.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house that may be demolished, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">It was raised in the property where drugs were traded in the past</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fight on the street and had to be called regularly to police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing deluged her and her partner this week violently from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to pull out voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">The dolphin was cheered by facilitated neighbors who said their lives were made hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One said: "They didn't care."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This morning we couldn't sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that they are finally gone, it will be nice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it had failed the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house to which police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "It is a disgrace that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, since a delocalisation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, as behaviour was extreme and its actions had to be viewed horribly for its neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have been brave and who have provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and give the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left behind in one of the house's bedrooms after dolphin on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers at home administration will now have to weave garbage that surrounds the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, police carried out a crackdown in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash totaling Â£1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after pleading guilty to possession of a drug of Class B in commercial custody.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who was killed in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without Obdach, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were coated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">Police say they will delocate tenants who do not abide by the house order</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow of the Police of Devon and Cornwall told AFP that the Delogization was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not abide by the House order.</seg>
<seg id="41">"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-criticism as well as to those who have been harmed by such behaviour," she said.</seg>
<seg id="42">Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives</seg>
<seg id="3">A Portuguese P-3C Orion plane of air force set off an incredible storm flight</seg>
<seg id="4">Air Force officials said it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk</seg>
<seg id="5">This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a tipical jet crashed over a full beach.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost in tangible proximity to the sunrise on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="7">The holidaymakers splashed out when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet chassis without first seeing what came through the clouds on them.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.</seg>
<seg id="9">Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media, said: "It flew really very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing down."</seg>
<seg id="10">Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."</seg>
<seg id="11">Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep</seg>
<seg id="12">The Portuguese air force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so deep that this was the only way to detect them.</seg>
<seg id="13">The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to nearby wildfires, but the air force insisted that safety was at no time at risk.</seg>
<seg id="14">Wildfires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, which also left four people dead on the island of Madeira.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Portuguese air force announced today that the pilot had to fly so deep because of the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view</seg>
<seg id="16">The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise</seg>

<seg id="2">Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4: 0 (12.5.4.4) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In doing so, the world ranking first picked up the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour finals tournament and just Olympia.</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenya's athletics team is threatening to unravel after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a fraud attempt at doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan official had been told that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, delivered a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported by Kenya's doping inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Association of IAAF has asked the IOC to provide information on the case to begin its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment," said an IAAF statement.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, delivered the sample and signed it," declared Kenya's head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, who was on the list for training checks at the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich had become World Cup fourth over 800 yards in Beijing in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics chief Michael Rotich was withdrawn from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed athletes of upcoming doping tests against money payments from his country.</seg>
<seg id="15">Media reports say he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special scrutiny at the IOC after numerous doping offences.</seg>
<seg id="17">In announcing the more than 2,000 doping target checks issued by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusually stated before that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was passed a few weeks before Olympics began.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping fight is in line with WADA rules.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a big runner-up nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The country's athletics team blew up most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of televised reports by ARD, allegations have repeatedly been made that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he employed them in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has been demonstrated that this sport has been widely and systematically muted.</seg>

<seg id="1">Salzburg's West Side Story with Cecilia Bartoli</seg>
<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.</seg>
<seg id="3">With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical captured Salzburg: The "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of the classic and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Maria.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra, the SimÃ³n BolÃ­var Orchestra, led by the Venetian conductor Gustavo Dudamel, "This music is full of rhythm," he warms.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and tune.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this stage Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers with Wehmut's love of her with Tony while younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Maria has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First, because it is musically extraordinary!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mariah's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So she's smart, obviously naive, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"She resembles me very much, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It's such an honor for us to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">She's a tremendously generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Directing is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in each of his movements, in his gaze, it's his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It's such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the West Side story is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorians went to New York and the New York residents did not want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.</seg>
<seg id="30">59 years later, the piece is still relevant.</seg>

<seg id="3">Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the late judge to the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reid said Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with some degree of certainty."</seg>
<seg id="6">A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.</seg>
<seg id="7">He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not provide for unrest with a new candidate.</seg>
<seg id="8">Garland is the top judge for the U.S. Appellate Court for the District of Columbia.</seg>
<seg id="9">RAID said Republicans blocked the Garland nomination were Lakaien and heroic supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also noted that Donald Trump is unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="3">But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses calendar for 2017.</seg>
<seg id="4">The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his neck magazine differs from old-school Playboys, since "Playboy is for men."</seg>
<seg id="5">I do that for women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Apparently he thinks it does the calendar as well.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We need to return to portraying timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release to release the calendar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Whoever doesn't adapt and Erdogan praises is sitting on packed suitors," says the president of the GÃ¼len-close Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the short term, the Kurdistan municipality of Germany expects tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand," the association's president, Ali Toprak, believes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to the harsh conduct of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup attempt, the Kurdistan community of Germany is awaiting a mass flight to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">"In the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition," the association's chairman, Ali Toprak, told the "world" on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because the government had overrun Kurdish strongholds with criminal action months ago, 500,000 Kurds are fleeing within Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the failed coup, there were still secular and opposition ethnic Turks.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It cannot be the case that a state that occupies refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," Toprak said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the association lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Algerian cities.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus Erdogan wanted to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or displaced over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.</seg>
<seg id="14">The association chief called for the federal government to be positioned "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters."</seg>
<seg id="15">A "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the GÃ¼len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition figures.</seg>
<seg id="19">The fire marker as a GÃ¼len trailer destroys teachers and other academics' professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Whoever doesn't adapt and Erdogan praises sits on packed suitors, incidentally the Kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the GÃ¼len-close Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World."</seg>
<seg id="21">As the newspaper reported, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks were the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the deadline of 30 June, these were 11,386 people, almost 29 percent of those recognised as being entitled to asylum (39,625).</seg>
<seg id="23">This survey does not contain the pre-war, poverty or lack of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="24">Asylum claims under the Basic Law are solely political, that is, by state, individually persecuted.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals do not get anything from the summer campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">They understood them in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the country elections will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament decided earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because stupid than before, it's not: Summer holidays, heat and country elections - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">Locals to be persuaded by the election fighters are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most holidaymakers travelling in the country on Usedom, RÃ¼gen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">These include practical problems: During the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers and, in the end, count out votes, only effortlessly.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has yet to get campaigning close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot period, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear for his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998's strongest party, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting how much newcomer AfD cuts and what remains at the end of Coalition dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 chief of government, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign, look out of his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chatts a little with the people, just as his legendary word-barred predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the flourishing of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, their "we are creating this" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the fine job now.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its top candidate, Home Secretary Lorenz Caffier, has already seen how it is when campaigning in the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to big shows; Merkel Bundestag is in the Northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There was probably the majority from other federal states," noted Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But no one from other corners of Germany can listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual election campaigns on market sites and in front of malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, Kokert says, only plays a "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union has also noted that it is crumbling away from the land, that it must make a great effort to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: There is little in the country's expanses.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the advice of the CDU candidate Kokert to his comrades is also self-evident: "They must go where it hurt, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD a particularly dedicated campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just short of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 2011 election, the SPD had still won clearly at 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven per cent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue of holiday hardship and largely transfer their campaign to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Online campaign," it calls the country's president Claudia MÃ¼ller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green election fighters are going to search for local voters among holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curves with a houseboat through the mecklenburgische Lakes and finds it beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her impression: "Election leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 refurbishment: Restaurants suffer from closure</seg>
<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is restored, there is nothing to meckle.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is praise for those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only at 8 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="4">"They made everything pretty tough," Elvira Tetzlaff told the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay either.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be moved to the south at half-time as planned by the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is also praised for the accommodation of those responsible for construction work, for example when it comes to setting up container entry.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site migrated south on Monday and the closure of AspergstraÃe in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has been restored.</seg>
<seg id="10">Citizens can now return from Ofterdingen to the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">The traffic from the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There were some significant complaints," says Florida King's deputy chief of staff responsible for the transport management of the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The inhabitants of Bachsettal Road, SteinlachstraÃe, HafnerstraÃe and Weiherrain had to contend with more traffic noise because many were looking for easy ways and more familiar to their Navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">This resulted in some lorries being franked in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits have not been met, the community has also called for the measuring vehicle from malignants.</seg>
<seg id="16">"There were significant transgressions," says King, who himself was knowledgeable about the situation on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="17">There have already been two to three per minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was with 77 kilometres in the speed 30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, but it has become more calm.</seg>
<seg id="20">For businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales collapses leaves anyone you ask.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some are less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the 'end customer', that is to say, produced for other companies, for which it has little effect.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thomas Sulz also talks about a "at most slight decline" in the car dealership Maier, but also acknowledges that of course "the running crowd is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The locales along the road are most hard hit.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert GÃ¶hner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only did it but all the restaurants hit it "hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottdies.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro of turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sales revenue plunged him to "well above 50 percent."</seg>
<seg id="33">The road survey rejected its operation "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his staff have had to be sacked.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been sacked, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President JÃ¶rg Schmidt responded to a question from GÃ¶hner as to whether there could be a financial compensation, noting that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. Now it would also have to bear the disadvantages caused by the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">GÃ¶hner knows of other counties where such something has been handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all complaints, GÃ¶hner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, referring to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are now less likely to miss out because of the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go down, it's nice elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="42">GÃ¶hner has no doubt about the fact that his regulars are coming back after the end of the rehabilitation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, GÃ¶hner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis his host has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, that is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Legislation is constantly being screwed up in the name of counter-terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2">Following recent attacks, Interior Minister de MaiziÃ¨re is now presenting a thick security package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a dating status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say about all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de MaiziÃ¨re gives the reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, the federal Home Secretary says in presenting his new security package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They don't overwhelm anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other further points would initially be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am also involved.</seg>
<seg id="10">As interior minister, however, he was keen on results and on a "viable consensus" within the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">De MaiziÃ¨re, following the recent attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ansbach, has left a little time out before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Something is already known, announced, pauses: That a new safety authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communications is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nor is the fact that Germany must implement several EU rules on passenger data and gun law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de MaiziÃ¨re is launching a second run for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far: He wants to punish sympathy for terrorist groups and knock down jihadists with dual citizenship the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.</seg>
<seg id="18">He still thinks this is reasonable and does not call for anything that does not have any chances in the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas present de MaiziÃ¨re as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have it in part: He plans fast-track procedures for deportations and more ways to arrest people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees targeted in the country are expected to check their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security review.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of denials for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of this is politically and legally sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="24">Many of them are still unexplained and leave questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And on a number of points - on the inequality of patient treatment, for example - the question arises: What does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de MaiziÃ¨re says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be denied that the bombers of Ansbach and WÃ¼rzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">Moreover, many people were worried about safety, given the high numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that profoundly employed people cannot be excluded in election campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="30">Internal security has been hugely focused.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">Uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are electoral struggles.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking a position on internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">Over the past few days, the two parties have been high.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garrison dispute over the equipment of federal police, then about a security-policy ideas collection of some Unionist interior ministers, in which department chiefs also call for a burqa ban and a departure from dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De MaiziÃ¨re also struggles with conciliatory sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">He doesn't think of a departure from the double passport.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">Making them new doesn't make sense.</seg>
<seg id="42">And with a burqa ban, he has constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether its own package on all corners is unconstitutional and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner has yet to show up.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is something in it that could cause controversy.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also currently trying to take advantage of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="46">Leader Sigmar Gabriel signals only a careful willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."</seg>

<seg id="1">Volkswagen is still glittering.</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite diesel scandals, delivery numbers are rising worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But not all markets are running around.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is a term in the recall.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen will start deliveries of goods in the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Europe's largest car maker, despite its many brands and a number of well-running markets, can continue to offer a plus over the past year.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, in July, VW's core brand slowed mainly in Western Europe, again loading total sales, as the company listed in the Dax reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 449100 cars than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China became the second-most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Germany, deliveries fell by almost one-sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brand sales chief JÃ¼rgen Stackmann attributed the weaker July figures mainly to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, in some core markets there has been a decline in purchasing by "changing economic conditions."</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation surrounding the attempted coup in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU also impacted, a spokeswoman explained.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, where the exhaust assailants first escalated, there is also a minus to Buche.</seg>
<seg id="15">Big support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overall, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony is already further glimmed by the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a 0.9 per cent export drop to 3.37 million vehicles is due.</seg>
<seg id="17">CEO Fred Kappler continued to show a sales share from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">1.3 percent more vehicles delivered to Volkswagen at this time, worldwide 5,904 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW calls for some 2.5 million cars to be converted into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">As part of the rearmament, VW confirmed that the construction of cars has no negative impact.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the conversion of vehicles there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The automaker is issuing a "guarantee-equal" certificate to the customer after the conversion, but does not talk about a "guarantee," as stated Friday in corporate travel.</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason is legal fine.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Focus reported that Volkswagen is now guaranteeing its German customers a guarantee of revamped diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">That was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives at the Federal Transportation Department.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Department of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW has to comply fully with the terms of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Deviations from this will not be accepted," Federal Transportation Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said, according to the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has accepted the guarantee that no deterioration occurs in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after conversion and that all type-approval vehicle values will remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" but does not, as it said in corporate travel.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the broad term "guarantee," Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers may, for example, come to a workshop for six months after the conversion, for example, with motor damage - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the interests of the customer, too, it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the absentee scandal, as it said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore VW does not use the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="1">Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands punitive interest from rich savers - the second institute in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="2">Bank Chairman Josef Paul said Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park Â£40 million on giro or day money accounts."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Federal Federation of German Banks speaks of an isolated case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers "do not have to fear paying for their savings groceries."</seg>
<seg id="4">Camps banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 per cent penalty rate.</seg>
<seg id="5">This fee will be charged by Raiffeisenbank Gmund as of September by private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros in Giro- or Day Money accounts.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The first 100,000 euros are free."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The next 100,000 will cost Â£400 a year in the future," Paul said.</seg>
<seg id="8">He has been wary of EUR 40 million for some time, which could be lifted from one day to the other and could not be used.</seg>
<seg id="9">"These are with me in the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs," the bank chief said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I can't put up for every million euros."</seg>
<seg id="11">The costs will now be borne by the polluter pays principle.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply letting the cash lie in the hallways of Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already seen four raids, I'm not still the fifth!" The bank chief said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most customers would understand and switch to other forms of investment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Few migrated to other banks.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Co-operative Association of Bavaria said: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate is causing significant costs for all banks."</seg>
<seg id="16">To carry them alone is "economically unsustainable."</seg>
<seg id="17">Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.</seg>
<seg id="18">With punitive interest rates for deposits starting at three million euros, the Thuringian People's and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="19">Michael Kemmer, chief executive of the banking association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits, so competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."</seg>
<seg id="20">One banker said that at Tegernsee there is "a clientele that is somewhat lush from assets."</seg>
<seg id="21">"This can become a problem for a small bank" if it hates money for free.</seg>
<seg id="22">Founded in 1911, the cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Eger, Kreuth and Tegernsee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Famous actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Co-operative Association of Bavaria "is not currently aware of any other banks charging an exit rate for deposits of private customers," spokesman Ernst said.</seg>
<seg id="25">The president of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe FrÃ¶hlich, said at the end of June: "The threshold of going into negative compared to the private customer is very, very high."</seg>
<seg id="26">The competition is tough, and it threatens the exodus of investors to competition.</seg>
<seg id="27">Customers in Germany will not be able to do so in width.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment part to oversaw it under the pseudonym non-Allevenus men's middle age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much-vaunted revival of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a plate are all predictably aged between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's also no hordes by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning: Older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are YouGov's results true?</seg>

<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly bowing to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specials.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I am close to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am joined by Sister Ray (data number: Two young women, three middle-aged men) in Reckless Records (data number: Eight middle-aged men, one woman, presumably around the 20), is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I appreciate already," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, depicted above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his apartment room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: He is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="19">"A lot of things I buy are from the late 1960s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12... things where I was probably something too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's my lads.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets will reach the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people being influenced by the media boot, people who have heard about the comeback and are being prompted to buy their old plates again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations I have had, people usually got rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to supporters of the record revival of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers took advantage of the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar disk hulls, from items that alert happy youth events.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or owning material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it's the case with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's an easy way to get mentally involved.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We're like their social workers!" Flares an employee from a plate stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those buying a record do not own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably be very concerned, while I blew through a stack of Bossa Nova complications.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works on sounds of the Universe (data number: Three middle-aged men), noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Someone came here just recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-like.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who are slow to get in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a bare audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists taking photos, teens and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts of the newest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drenched from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them look very lonely, but naming mental trauma is hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes more of a shop bump than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives away with a beloved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business of saying that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired: Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I seem to mutate the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenagers group up for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">To the left is a stairwell, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: A mix of contemporary music and classics that feature essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just purely decorative, some so far above that it's impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It's pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send into the depths of sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research revealed that YouGov's results are true, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning with the bumble through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while miles the startling look of an unruly, 30-year-old fake presenter who rages over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to bring down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to tear down 72 provisional deals in which people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, offering hairdressing services or selling tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">Calais prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-backed union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also concluded that provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who operate the 72 provisional shops, but acknowledged that the concerns of Calais prefecture were "absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge, Jean-FranÃ§ois Molla, said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' CafÃ© des Lagers, which is commonly operated and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' CafÃ©.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it said that closing "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 - the highest number to date - after a steep increase in arrivals over the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's Raser has to adjust to the next generation speed gauge: In various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are designed to transfer packets particularly effectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden, for example, can be used at accident points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that speed limits are met by a stationary flash.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is autark: Its battery holds five days in uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measuring technology also allows all vehicles to be captured across several tracks simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits and transit bans after time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the high-powered state you can move the trailer, according to the manufacturer, with every car with trailer clutch.</seg>
<seg id="10">In order to prevent it from being knocked down, it has been lowered in the measurement mode so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and, incidentally, shattered outer shell.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect lightning from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested, according to Vitronic, in various federal states.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-yard rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis on Thursday night when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji awarded a masterclass in the handling, side-stepping, hindrance, line-up and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept by the not-too-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Boks' marked defeat, 7-5 in the semifinals the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">That setback will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks hit GBs for fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell was running in driving buses, and the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards as osea Kolinisau ran out in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With still four minutes remaining, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely grabbed the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A heaping tack from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it just stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, JASA leaned Veremalua in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the rematch and there was still over a minute of play... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preached through more weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still learns.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is the case.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half until Josua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interplay by Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a try for GB, making a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favor of the South Sea supervisors whose fans sang, flags waved and danced in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire Fijis's playing approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set up the i-bag with another try in the final seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff quipped that Fijis huddled himself and GB kicked damnedly in the turf.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day, Fiji beat Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race - Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with trainer's cancer to roam victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotine gold than in these games and that wants to be what.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing strike to the last, 220 hard Hieve to enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although it was only the Beiden who sat at the helm, there were three votes in the boat.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39.th undefeated effort, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of tails, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to goose.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make up the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would survive that day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he was doing what risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky that he was able to start treatment in early 2014, outside the season, which kept the stoppage to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I soon had to do better.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was the principal in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week... That may be something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much this means to me how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we wouldn't be one, so a massive thank you go to him, he's the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a tough rhythm with which their opponents couldn't compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "bleeding in the process, staying in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important not to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do something Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realise I'm an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">For 31 years, exemplary clarity</seg>
<seg id="2">The managing director of the "Veitensteingruppe," Ruppert GÃ¶ller, retires.</seg>
<seg id="3">The association is regarded as a "Bavarian example."</seg>
<seg id="4">A small fraternal drinking water utility association as a model for large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some time ago it was mentioned in the original tone in a contribution from the Bavarian radio.</seg>
<seg id="6">Soon after, the water forum of the government of subfrancs appreciated the ring association.</seg>
<seg id="7">The work of the Veitensteingruppe was regarded as exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert GÃ¶ller, who has been in the ring-fence for 31 years, 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retired at age 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The water utility association of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water each year and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member communities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">Water supply contracts exist for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud BÃ¼hl (FW), recalled that Rupert GÃ¶ller was hired as a water officer in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the ring association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"His duties have been very diverse and they ranged from water management and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," the chairman said.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, she called the start-up and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the rehabilitation of the high containers (1999), the reintroduction of central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water lines.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no deadlock at all, and there has always been innovations because water meant life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her Laudatio, she praised GÃ¶llers loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has campaigned with a lot of heart blood for his water utility association and he has consistently lived the water utility association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitensteingruppe for nitrates reduction in front of the water forum of the district of Unterfranken.</seg>
<seg id="20">He received a great deal of recognition and praise for that.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert GÃ¶ller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water man and he was a faithful knack.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view, he called the well-being and the restructuring of the ring association.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the hardest use were, however, the pipe collapse at the high tank at Kirchlauter on a January 3.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here, at minus 17 degrees, the whole night will have to work so that the towns could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">The supply of Neubrunn was maintained once again because it was filled with hoses in Pettstadt's high tank.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel StÃ¼rmer from Lauter, who is the successor to Rupert GÃ¶ller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Light view for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-battered and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared millions of additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that have threatened the industry from oil production are off the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the liberation from the Renewable Energy levy on inventories for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ, Friday's edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"I'm really glad that after two years of tough negotiations we were finally able to achieve that."</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers who use gases from the hoop to produce electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German trade association, the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros a year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ there is now a keynote agreement with the EU Commission following talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants will an EEG levy of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this is not raised in the steel industry either.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on own-energy production.</seg>
<seg id="12">This largely enshrines the status quo of the existing system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's success in the steel industry is particularly important.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In terms of our" Steel campaign, "this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Others have to follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Climate and employment objectives must also be weighed up in the reform of the emissions trading regime," said IG Metal Chief JÃ¶rg Hofmann in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressures since the 2008 financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to deteriorate as the world's largest producer country, China, threw mass steel onto the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on imported steel are showing an impact, and on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has hung up.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">German industry primary Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Most recently, prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost cuts.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp did not want to rule out closures of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">They produced well six per cent less crude at 3.4 million tonnes than in the previous year, according to economic union Steel reported Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief increase in May, the produced crowd now declined for the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been two per cent below the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the Association expects to see an increase in its order position.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: Singing does senior people well</seg>
<seg id="2">Singing has already accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl she was in school choir, in the Lehramt studies she lectured the compartment music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a sample, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good about her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors right from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with peers the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular coexistence, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because social and family structures often solve at age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her chorus: "Take off and organize, rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of coexistence."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because seniors are training deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of the puste in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the federal Labor Association of senior organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common singing was much higher, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of her youth time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, self-dementia sufferers escape long-running events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head is also required to perform a special performance, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, concentrate on your own voice and on a given rhythm, adapting to the other singers - that is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Older people who live alone practice not just to focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition obtained by singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: If I go for something for a long time, I get better and wake up beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, then there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who is listening when a sound goes next?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="30">Singing someone from the acquaintance in a senior choir can easily be joined.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the ChÃ¶re area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can contact the community or the church front directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior places are also found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cats react more sensitively than hangover on cries of young animals</seg>
<seg id="2">Biologists have studied in Hanover the effect of running cat babies on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">To their surprise, this didn't make the males cold either - but they kept the same in contrast to the females.</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize Katzenbaby's grazing degree.</seg>
<seg id="5">They respond by 10 per cent faster to Laute of kittens who choose to be in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH) found.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hangovers also respond to the calls of kittens - but always equal.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Obviously, the acoustic differences between mistrust of less and heavily razed juveniles for the males are either not perceptible or not relevant," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is a graduate of the study, published this Friday in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kittens were different from the urgency of their need for help.</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult hangovers and eight kittens from the MHH's livestock were observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were presented for one run of little ones, taken from the root box for three minutes and separated by mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, they were confronted with chills of more razed kittens, which were additionally raised.</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the low sample.</seg>
<seg id="14">"All females, even those who haven't had their own offspring, responded differentially to the cries," Konerding said.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned faster to the loudspeaker when this call of the very rainy kittens played off.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be innate or evolve with the gender maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"One surprise was that the males responded at all," the biologist said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past, scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby noise.</seg>
<seg id="19">Some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to babies, whether or not they were mothers, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.</seg>

<seg id="1">Podolski picks up with "Gala" after Supercup</seg>
<seg id="2">Hakan SÃ¼dkisr is a football legend in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan SÃ¼dkisr.</seg>
<seg id="4">He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football game is again taking place in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="6">In front of the duel of the archrival between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even when the state of emergency was imposed following the overthrow in July, the government promised that ordinary citizens' daily lives should not be affected.</seg>
<seg id="8">But that does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah GÃ¼len, who are blamed for the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not done before football.</seg>
<seg id="10">The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against former Starkicker Hakan SÃ¼dkisr.</seg>
<seg id="11">So the South Coast, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="12">South Korea is said to be supporters of the preacher Fethullah GÃ¼len, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the state of emergency, which was first imposed for 90 days until October, has no effect on the lives of most Turks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The late-night "democracy guards" in public places across the country declared Erdogan quit Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="16">Especially fans of the Besiktas working-class club are traditionally not among the president's friends.</seg>
<seg id="17">But what unites the bulk of the Turks, given dramatic experience in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats Galatasaray or Besiktas.</seg>
<seg id="19">At postseason "Gala," it will arrive especially again on Lukas Podolski.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the past season, Cologne proved its sporting value: With 17 goals and nine boards in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the final match against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 victory.</seg>
<seg id="22">The newspaper "Fanatics" hailed him: "He was the best in the place."</seg>
<seg id="23">He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team's cup.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thanks to Poldi, the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory deal.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the runner-up K.o in the Champions League, the "lions" also varied early in the Europa League.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the southern Lig it was only six.</seg>
<seg id="27">The season wasn't good.</seg>
<seg id="28">The cup was the only way to win something.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We've done that and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.</seg>
<seg id="30">For champions Besiktas, the season ran better.</seg>
<seg id="31">Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 seasons, placed the base for the 14th title as a South Lig goalkeeper.</seg>
<seg id="32">That's also why fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old's return.</seg>
<seg id="33">In doing so, the Gomez, which is under contract with AC Florence, and which was only sold to Besiktas after the coup attempt, did not return because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.</seg>
<seg id="34">"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," the trade magazine quoted "Kicker" club chief Fikret Orman.</seg>
<seg id="35">To do so, however, the striker would have to be prepared to waive around a third of his annual salary, estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear: "His salary at Florence we cannot pay."</seg>

<seg id="2">34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already banned twice because of doping (2001 and 2006).</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa must not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="4">Other outspoken athletics sins can only laugh at it - they're fighting medals in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="5">The issue of doping still determines the headlines at the Rio Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="6">Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had entered her starting right just before the Games after a doping ban, was mercilessly pumped out and busted at her start (100 metres chest).</seg>
<seg id="7">It offered itself a whimsical scene: With a hung smile, she was still stumbling into the hall and had provoked with her appearance.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it was determined that she would not get gold, the audience broke into a jubilant storm.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are still many other athletes who are on the run despite doping past at the Rio Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here is an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-relay / USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was already banned two times because of doping (2001 and 2006 through 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since his bann, the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-world champion have run even faster than before, he is more than 100 m in 9.80 seconds the world's number one and is considered the biggest challenger to Usain Bolt.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-relay / Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit down a six-month lock in 2010 after being proven to be the painkiller Oxycodon.</seg>
<seg id="15">She had strong tooth pain after undergoing surgery, defending the 29-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sandra Perkovic (Diskus / Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion of 2012, world champion of 2013 and European champion tested positive for banned stimulant methylhexanamine from 2010 to 2016.</seg>
<seg id="17">Perkovic denied the knockout take and was banned for six months.</seg>
<seg id="18">The four furthest seasoning this year goes to the account of the big gold favorite.</seg>
<seg id="19">LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-relay / USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, was tested positively in 2010 and 21 months closed.</seg>
<seg id="20">One means of retirement expansion was responsible, Merritt pleaded.</seg>
<seg id="21">This year, the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world.</seg>
<seg id="22">Iwan Tichon (hammering, Belarus): Hardly any athlete has yet to recognize so many medals.</seg>
<seg id="23">So Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after being identified with him testosterone doping.</seg>
<seg id="24">The 40-year-old also had to give Olympic silver in 2004 due to steroid doping and the 2006 EM title due to testosterone abuse.</seg>
<seg id="25">He received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games as a result of a judgment of the International Sports Court CAS.</seg>
<seg id="26">At 80.04 m he is ranked second in the world rankings.</seg>
<seg id="27">Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world record holder and gold favorite was tested positively only in May but may still start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="28">At the 29-year-old world champion, hints of taking a banned food supplement were found, the ban on the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mild and ran out as early as July 13.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, the Foreign Office spokesman, Thomas SchnÃ¶ll, said Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She suffered cuts and was treated in hospital, but she was already able to leave.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her home trip she planned for early September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether Austrian citizens are also affected by the further explosions on the island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, according to SchnÃ¶ll.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin was first seen exploding two bombs in an exit area on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two explosives went up again Friday morning, killing another person, according to authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured at the detonation near Patong, which is popular with holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded that killed an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">The blast was in the air, according to authorities in a flower beet before the remnants of coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and Chumphon on the south-east coast still claimed several injuries.</seg>
<seg id="15">You go from a link to the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," Army General Danai Kritmethavee said Friday morning before journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We assume it is a coordinated attack."</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to comment on possible motives - but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This is just local sabotage, which is confined to limited areas and provinces," a spokesman in Bangkok said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Instead, one assumes that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">Authorities have received intelligence on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - but they have not been informed of the exact timing and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group was standing behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">Police instructed their officials across the country to step up security around major government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they usually do not target tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin lies a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">Following the bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry on its homepage recommends that it comply with the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (safety level 3) applied to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and surrounding areas.</seg>
<seg id="30">After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, there is no need to travel to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (safety level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a disputed referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">It also gives the military great influence in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving toward stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is holding itself to benefit from having led the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has also failed to cope with the insurgency of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just over a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were also killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="1">The right-wing "Identity Movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to several national tribunals, constitutional defenders in the federal government have also been monitoring the group.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We see evidence at the 'Identitarian Movement' of aspirations against the liberal democratic basic order," said Constitutional Secretary Hans-Georg MaaÃen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are becoming extremist.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why we are now monitoring the movement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Identity Movement" is a grouping with French roots that has also been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">It opposes "multiculti-Wahn," "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of its own identity through over-alienation."</seg>
<seg id="8">Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Sachsen and ThÃ¼ringen - are already watching the "Identitaries."</seg>
<seg id="9">Maassen said his authority had been closely aligned with the national offices in the decision.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Groups like the 'Identity Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," the constitutional secretary said.</seg>
<seg id="11">In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music.</seg>
<seg id="12">That would be Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not a good advertisement for your own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propaganda is meant to raise people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="16">That is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of "identities" to African politicians.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maassen said he had no findings on that.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possible contacts of this kind are only relevant to constitutional protection.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is important that the relevant party - in this case the AfD - be changed by certain people who are extremist, and become so extremist.</seg>
<seg id="21">So it is crucial whether such people have a controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not apparent.</seg>
<seg id="23">With regard to the significant increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, MaaÃen said he would not yet talk of new right-wing terrorism in this context.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have found in recent years that there can be legal-terrorism structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the Old School Society or the Friday Group.</seg>
<seg id="26">It may well be that other rights-based groups or micro-groups that plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugees or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, there is no evidence of German-wide or pan-European governance of legal terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created at regional or social level.</seg>
<seg id="29">There was concern about the fact that many assaults on the account of people who had not previously appeared on the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is the cause of concern.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">"So many people have committed crimes that had nothing in the past with far-right extremists who were perhaps politically indifferent or, for example, elected CDU, SPD or the left, but who then radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist voting."</seg>

<seg id="1">Rio 2016: ROBEL Kiros Have become Internet Thit</seg>
<seg id="2">Not always determine the Olympians or world records the headlines at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the brave appearance of ROBEL Kiros Have at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he wasn't seen at times in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral Internet thit.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished with a lag of 48 seconds his lead and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that drew the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopians got a special starter right from the International Swimming Federation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming more familiar in underrepresented countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since the majority of athletes are running in evictions, Habte simply wanted to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Have ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly, the first nicknames made the lap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media called him "ROBEL of the Wal."</seg>
<seg id="16">In line with a "welfare belly," the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod."</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he only struck with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 metres freistil, played no part.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Eric Moussambani's run caused media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to arrive alone in a lead of more than 100 metres.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetic, Moussambani was fired at the time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the contest.</seg>

<seg id="2">The consumer research company GfK is exchanging its head Matthias Hartmann.</seg>
<seg id="3">The resignations suddenly came - but not quite surprising.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difficult situation of the market research company GfK has allowed the chair of chief executive Matthias Hartmann to become all the more uncertain the longer the success he has promised.</seg>
<seg id="5">Turmoil at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company, the world's number five faces a new workforce.</seg>
<seg id="6">GFK chief executive wants to leave the company at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahert is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect on 12 September.</seg>
<seg id="8">As of September 1, the Executive Board member Gerhard Hausruckinger informed the Company.</seg>
<seg id="9">He is to officially assume the role of a "CEO" until a successor to Hartmann is found.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on long-term business orientation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Details didn't want to name a company spokesman on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Anyone who is going to run the market research company in the future is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="13">In investor circles, it was said on Friday that shareholders were most disappointed with the continued success of the restructuring launched years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Hartmann has been at GfK's top since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible after 5 years," it said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Given the last bad GfK business figures, any shareholder will eventually be unsettled.</seg>
<seg id="17">"If that were the case with BMW, they would do the quandts," it said.</seg>
<seg id="18">The company had also failed to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarter.</seg>
<seg id="19">With $361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable year-ago quarter.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the first half of the year, sales shrank by 3.4%, with 721.2 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="21">Earnings in the second quarter primarily impacted the Company's healthy value given its difficult economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company's value write-downs of EUR 139 million, which were necessary in the Consumer Experience Division, cost the Group a loss of EUR 148.2 million.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.</seg>

<seg id="1">The charges per cubic metre of wastewater are 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros for the area of the Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl sewage plant from 1 October 2016; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros (â¬2.26) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (â¬2.18).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the Azendorf plant, the sewage fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvements are needed.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a surplus calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd SteinhÃ¤user (CSU) reported, during the approval of the budget by the State Board of Kulmbach, it was found that undercover for these sewage plants is running.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal bases, to operate the facilities at a cost.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, citizens and industrial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel, a reclassification of charges for the sewage plants of the market was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or sub-ceilings from the previous calendar period should also be offset.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt's serious charges were based on the fact that all three sewerage plants were relatively small, with a very low sewage attack between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, the low distribution base would have a serious impact on the costs of necessary repairs of several thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, waste water is slightly declining in all three plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, in the previous calculation period all three plants were affected to a significant extent, not least because of their age, rehabilitation and repair expenses.</seg>
<seg id="14">The complex in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for puppies, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf sewage plant the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Welschenkahl pumping plant, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor plants had to be overtaken from scratch, and the Lopp particle treatment plant had to be phased out after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed to meet the water requirements.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses included the advanced maintenance and maintenance costs to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were well below current levels in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">SteinhÃ¤user made it clear that, in the case of a low sewage attack in the three plants, the costs of operation and maintenance are "fully exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt added, the market community has been spared large entertainment costs at sewage plants over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for these installations will continue to remain precarious in the long term, given that the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water utility group cannot be extended to cover these plants because they are deficient facilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat 'Anime' effect criticised as Asian caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unfazed, stand-alone tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies a day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused of promoting Blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty deal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it suggested to some users a filter this week that gave them sleeves, false teeth and dark cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow-eye."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely circulated Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: The filter was thought to be a tribute to anime characters rather than a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who experienced racism reminded the filter of vulnerable clichÃ©s.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others strongly opposed the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet spread across the photos, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and to say the least uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the counterpart of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effect.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not weird, but that the yellow view has been drawn into the aberration.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company crossing these cultural stumbling sites.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integrity struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's great audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, "so it's much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be," 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account called on others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that rash-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Either they don't have different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors working there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or well, to say what against it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their view, a complaint that Snapchat largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but, according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a staff officer focused on underrepresented communities and internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu, for its part, said she will close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that's not O.K."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, notes committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel from the United States Central Command changed intelligence to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than had allowed actual conditions on the ground, a committee of inquiry from Congress reported in a report Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, drawn up by a task force of Republican members of the force commander, intelligence commander and the military budget commander, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Intelligence information typically disguised by senior CENTCOM commanders regularly recorded a more positive picture of American efforts to counter terrorism than had allowed actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"What happened at CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership errors in CENTCOM range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 10-page report details persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their presenters to draw a more optimistic picture of the Islamic State's threat, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts," the report noted.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CENTCOM member announced publicly that a military reconnaissance of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"After months of investigation, so much is clear," Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, said in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="14">From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top Central Command officials changed intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republicans launched the task force after they admitted that analysts were worried about manipulating reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations into CENTCOM reports are under way by the Ministry of Defence's inspector general.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the news center released their own findings on Thursday, consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In 2014 and 2015, CENTCOM created an overly limited process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">That process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the release of intelligence reports," damaging morale among analysts and "gave unduly little room for dissent."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and Democrats declined to find any evidence of White House intervention among CENTCOM analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's inspector general, which were recorded after complaints from CENTCOM analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press secretary, admitted in an opinion that the Defense Department would not comment on reports from Congress while the inspector general's investigation was still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also admitted that "experts sometimes have very divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigation has had repercussions over the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of Defense Department officials).</seg>
<seg id="27">But last year's accusations raised questions about how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the incidents of more than ten years ago, when a CENTCOM analyst, Gregory Hooker, summed up a document on how the then-government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupying force in Iraq, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, and gave little time to the invasion in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, found that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have been operational to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, that finding was not released, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcom's then-commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">A day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match Thursday against India that the Americans blew with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember having ever done that.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." She said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know this: The Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic race and are equal in their group with Britons in first place, undefeated after their 2-0 win against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will win the first and second place each.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-place pick will leave the strong Dutch a little longer, leading the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game on Saturday, Americans have unleashed a surprising whistle through their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the last of 12.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of that team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in hands for the first time with three years (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player of the US, the youngest in the team's history.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she couldn't qualify for the caddie.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and started to turn things to better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the workload in London we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We've got to grab the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday night, Bam opened the goalscoring in the first half of the game with a backhand shot from close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly angry and held the playoff record from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lured the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the goalkeeper of the United States, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a goal in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympics, the Zen des Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a rapid relay between competition and pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning baton, stretching from the bracelet to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the queue at the caffeshop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is here for the first time at the Olympics and is a woman's swarm with horror, could well have been among those familiar names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmer, Turner or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame doesn't exactly illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, some in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognised: Air pistachio, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may it last for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I get humble arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampolin.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived the last 16 years that many of those, I questioned, did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline, and by 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jump has some outsider charm, in part because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than the one for the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert but just an earth-bound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonish treatise of its never-ending cloudy impact - but also the Grazie des Turnens and Tauchens, the two sports that essentially unite it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "Trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shooting nearly up to 30 feet in the air and must have a number of falling movements (turning, lifting and saltos) before landing on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to the performance, difficulty and flight time.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-time athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal hopefuls must go further, faster, up and over in their pursuit of gold, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also in television broadcasting another mockery goal: That of the world or of the Olympic cord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to stir even a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I find even when watching these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing space.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she collides, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is competition here too, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreary, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's skills and fingers will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the endings as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">Amid the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If awareness increases can only be achieved through the anxiety and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his after-air, new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="1">'a generation protests' in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia met violent opposition from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say tens of protesters were killed during clashes with police in gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government have rocked the country and extended into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said police officers shot and killed tens of unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">Circulating videos about the protests, which are probably from last year or earlier, show how security personnel beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now calling for an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is Africa's most populous country after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, with few countries in Africa, if any, receiving so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was far from a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently cited government repression - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"If you suppress people and these no other options have except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protest.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of power from the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the opposition's last seat and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a fight over this zaked, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts worry that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been forced more or less in recent years, could exploit the turmoil and rearm itself.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years of HinkÃ¶cheln.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: Smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years have very many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became more frequent and Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said they gathered so to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Aonen, the Amharas, who come from Athopaedic predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economics, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flat-land areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"We're coordinating under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which account for around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister until his death at an unpublicised illness in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly savvy at seeing early signs of discontent and using special officers to edit opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively obscure reasons to take up Mr Meles's position.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, were seemingly botched by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in recent months and that time of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal mischief.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters attacked Gondar, an amhardy city, led by Tigray, and hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drones flights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed that base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"This," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very thin grate hike."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his claim Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to dispel the latest controversy that surrounds his campaign by admitting that his multiple repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group was not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">That clarification raised new questions about the communications capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate about whether he is able to communicate clearly and intelligently with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades who seek to protect him during an eventful period, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements he might not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the suggestion at a campaign event Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rested in relation to Thursday's claim, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he thought the allegation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When conservative radio operator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The latest storm of criticism is spurring on Mr. Trump, while he has sought to shift the focus of his campaign to the economic situation because of falling polls.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton made speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Speaking via Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already put sarcasm on his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said that Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later declared "Of course I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then shrink back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction falls," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who watches the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for presidential elections, Mr. Trump adopted an even more corrosive tone as his poll numbers continued to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new poll by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist released on Friday showed a lead with a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologise for his provocative remarks, he frequently accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is more focused on attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, gave great effort to defend the candidate in a CNN interview Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he says is legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said he was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true, in this sense, that before Obama was ISIS an almost unknown, small organisation, he called it backbenchers, completely wrong, and because he withdrew troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, ISIS allowed itself to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of walking around on each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He derided the "poor, pitiful" television experts trying to understand him and said, "You can't!."</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as just another evidence that he was unfit for president.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once pushed over the price off the market, CafÃ© comes back in Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue shop front were pushed out.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Soap Cherie business, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrified city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is changing, but I still can't believe CBGB dead, the Chelsea hotel exempted and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, it's also reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepted credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly slim atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafÃ© who is the owner and managing director of the new cafÃ©.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a client offered him to provide funds for a new outsider, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, maintained a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and acidic onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are nature tours.</seg>
<seg id="21">The cafÃ© no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a stalled stream of old regulars.</seg>
<seg id="23">"A lot of old customers were also pushed out by prices from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way on herself.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb closed, she gave up coffee drinkers for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I became clear that it was on coffee and culture in the verb that struck me," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual Iced Coffees, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been another longtime and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and invariably ordered the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Today Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he had no grudge about the fact that the soap business took the old business room.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the coffee of the cafÃ© as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we're still going to go on their offer," Rodriguez said.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the cafÃ©.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he prefers to exhibit it soon so his new neighbours feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The site also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold-fried coffee.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance the cafe will expand to a nearby building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was regulars and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new cafÃ© opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I had to smell that," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his rise to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a faible for sophisticated delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as PÃ¢te de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu that day was slightly more modest: Stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato pastry and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," Jane Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes' last book, "Chop Suey," acted from Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman, in her book "97 Orchard," told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear at Harper Verlag on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich shop for dinner, a small, cordless snack in the Flatiron District, which has already been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive oil, while Coe, 57, was eating truthline with potato pastry and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered hacking, this found the couple fit for a discussion about eating in the Great Depression era.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Rich food was very popular," Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were made from an ingredient and somewhat cheap, stretching the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Coe grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It must have settled in the stomach like lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cook for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pastes for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War. "A Square Meal" marked the way in which the country was dealing with it, no longer being the shard country.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It was a time when food became a central, tense issue for Americans," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Just as tense was the new budget diet: Mysterious food such as bread and casserollen became staple foods, which Kasserolle described as a "wonderful way to revalue essence," Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unappetized ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which has been the focus of American cuisine for years, became a rarely serviced luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar blends were tried, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even common cooking.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It wasn't a popular addition at lunchtime," Coe says.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home-grown recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - drove the country's eating habits such.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budget politicians" and to live up to the challenge of turning pampy like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historic leakage.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers's Lass-me-cake-eating attitude, are palatable.</seg>
<seg id="36">While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he poured like the millionaire man of the world to whom he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife, Eleanor, had asked him to issue an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the presence of a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Ms Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also to prepare one of the most defiant. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the Great Depression era to deal with food were discarded once the country got back on its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple admitted to writing the book's eating habits better understood by Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how she couldn't throw food away.</seg>
<seg id="45">"She had a real fear of the waste of food," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ziegelman recalled: "She actually made people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the windfall incident.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: The plum dessert, which President Roosevelt ate at noon.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a send name.</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no slaughtered cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone appeared somewhat reluctant to take a spoon in the tough, brown Glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.</seg>
<seg id="53">Coe took an aftershock three times.</seg>
<seg id="54">Like a Can-Do budgeter, he said to his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna was allowed to return to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with well over 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to date.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks only get up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland shark lies along the coast of the North Atlantic, with an average of just 1,220 metres.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five-metre long animal accelerates to a hefty 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal at this maximum speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this loneliness seems to be a recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science at any rate a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Madness," notes Alexander Schoulein of the Max Planck Institute for demographics in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks will be stone-painted.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the Ice Sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about Greenland's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow-motion pace decreases her when she issued six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey do this sharks anyway: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleepy animals or patrol at the bottom of the iceberg and seek carcasses that torch down from higher water levels.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now looked at 28 Greenland sharks that caught fishermen in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen between 2010 and 2013 as by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 inches long, while the largest 502 inches tall.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon 14 method the lens core of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had remarkably much carbon-14 in the lineman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tests dragged larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third-smallest animal with 220 centimetres length, the lineman contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 levels in their linemen, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon 2pm for a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark showed an age of 335, while the record shark with 502 centimetres is likely to be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland females only get offspring when they are longer than four metres was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now researchers of length were able to assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of gender maturity and its age was determined by 156 years, Greenland sharks can obviously be propagated at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This, too, is likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck set a 120-year-old harpoline, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on Sparflamme.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and aging slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The loss of heat from a gram mouse is therefore much greater than a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: They have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"A smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Schoulein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources more in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frankfurt benefits from Brexit</seg>
<seg id="2">The city on the Main therefore has the best opportunities to attract jobs and firms from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtland, head of the IW's financial and real estate markets.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial institutions can continue to operate from London through financial transactions across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the so-called EU passport, they have until now been authorised in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is what big US banks are using.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks have already announced plans to shift jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobbying group expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB) shares responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as EIOPA and the ESRB risk body.</seg>
<seg id="10">While the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is headquartered in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The proximity to the central bank is important to banks as they can communicate so directly with oversight," says IW professor Voigtland.</seg>
<seg id="12">Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but it is also worse off in infrastructure, as is Dublin.</seg>
<seg id="13">Frankfurt is significantly easier to reach thanks to the major airport.</seg>
<seg id="14">The city also has easy access to commercial properties.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In Paris, it's not so easy to find free high-quality offices," Voigtland says.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are 50% higher than on the Main.</seg>
<seg id="17">Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a ranking of consultancy Mercer, the city is ranked seventh, Luxembourg at No. 19, Dublin at No. 33 and Paris at 37th.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although quality of life is a matter of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concluded.</seg>
<seg id="20">London, however, will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to economic researchers.</seg>
<seg id="21">For this, the balance of power also speaks: In London, around 144000 people worked in the banking sector according to national bank Helaba figures at the end of 2015 and 62500 in Frankfurt.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton earns 10.75 million in 2015 and pays 34.2% federal tax</seg>
<seg id="2">Hillary Clinton released her tax return for 2015 on Friday, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband, and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in Redehonoraries; the former secretary of state gave an income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the State Department.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clinton's nominee for the vice-president, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, disclosed his tax returns, along with his wife Anne Holton.</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton campaign hero Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backers about his past promises to publish his tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law because of that.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax review by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They're on the train," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the publication of the Democrats' presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax audits are not complete.</seg>
<seg id="12">Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, have already said that his refusal raises questions about assets, his donations to charitable organizations, his business interests and various other links, particularly with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has already plunged to the issue and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which senior Republican Trump is calling for his tax returns to be published.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="16">Politico has reported that Trump did not pay or very little tax during the 1990s for two years, and an economics journalist at the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday as saying that could still be the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">Federal taxes have become an issue in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Obama also supports the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="20">During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called Trump for a meeting to exchange their tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="21">Buffett said he had also undergone a tax review of the IRS and Trump was "afraid" of voters rather than tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clinton's campaign has released tax returns back to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.</seg>
<seg id="24">The 2011 Clinton tax returns showed that they paid only USD 100 of their income, unlike most Americans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their main asset was a low-cost index fund from which the Clinton dividends and yields of USD 109,000.</seg>

<seg id="2">Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going in people-owned settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuder.</seg>
<seg id="3">The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea of doing so years ago, has stepped up its promotion along with U.S. nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, using a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and crops without violating animals.</seg>

<seg id="6">"Since we developed the... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change of attitude within these communities, which are much more confident that they can discourage elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide's managing director Damian Bell said in a note.</seg>
<seg id="7">The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.</seg>
<seg id="8">If he is not deterred, a so-called "Chiliwolke" is thrown.</seg>
<seg id="9">Chilipuder milled with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom whose end is turned up to the ignition.</seg>
<seg id="10">When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and spits fine dust to chilipuder into the air.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewish director crushed Berlin hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed following 'Arab' call - RT News</seg>
<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media frenzy after betraying that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre-election election as it had "requested Arab guests," according to an employee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country pre-selection list.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed between countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?</seg>
<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to elect Israel through its own call center.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to a statement seeking comment, the director turned to hotel reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hotel employee said the measure was a "deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels."</seg>
<seg id="12">The reason behind it sparked even more anger in the director.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the preselection be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted as saying.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," the South German newspaper reported.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were horrified and dismayed by this event.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is really very shameful.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this has been reflected in this very chain of hotels in Germany is an even greater disgrace.</seg>
<seg id="18">This does not require any explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">We expect the hotel to draw "the right conclusions," the official said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some told the Kempinski Hotel that it had "succumbed" to the alleged calls from Arab guests.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Don't be ashamed," it said in another post, noting that the hotel, located on the noble KurfÃ¼rstendamm, is close to a synagogue.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations of itself and called the incident an "oversight" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There was never a direct statement" not to include Israel in the fast-track list, "the South German newspaper quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying.</seg>
<seg id="25">It adds that the country pre-election has now been added.</seg>

<seg id="4">Russian companies are taking on existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to access the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "Dzhagaryan said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Russian imports into Iran jumped 91.5 percent and totaled $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trade recovery was achieved through supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, "the ambassador said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dzhagaryan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, Russian foreign representation issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.</seg>

<seg id="7">In the evening before, pastor Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, segmented the pilgrimage cruises and told the pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">Horb was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where even a MÃ¼nster Unserer Lieben woman stands and the pilgrimage path was approached by the MÃ¼nster.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the morning and evening, each of the daily tours was surrounded by a brief impulse with different prayers, songs and fonts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis made roast on field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song of specially assembled pilgrimage song.</seg>
<seg id="11">The local parish houses were available for overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and vigorous dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day it went over furlongs to GÃ¼tenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tags then entered the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but in the case of swollen heat, some 500 metres of altitude had to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="15">The earned reward was a common barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburger MÃ¼nster later in the afternoon and crossed the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the evening fair in MÃ¼nster, the Minis of Cooperative Markus Obert was welcomed by the pilgrimage destination.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the church service, pilgrims could visit the Sakristei and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">In conclusion, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong Community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scot Callum Skinner stormed home as Briton drowned gold for cycling</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio when the British team defended the 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had embraced.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in March at the rail world championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as a hint.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man they stayed in when they saw potential in the Scots, which has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standings the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes was just back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A policy change made up much of the transformation, with Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell skinner, Kenny and Hindes, as they rose to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said: "It's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph at the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted he deliberately fell on the train after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew that statement later and there was no appeal from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">There was no such problem this time in such a surprising victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: "It feels like the whole GB of flags in the gallery like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We've come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We got so badly away at so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that has won seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kennys is in the range of possible, he repeated Hoy's win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would mean an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born).</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal contest of the day, but there was more good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-mile race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They came in 3: 51,942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the contest, where Wiggins will certainly focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had struggled with officers before qualifying yesterday when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13.260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is relying on its strong rail team to dominate the mid-period of the Olympics and pick up a bowl of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were lowered.</seg>
<seg id="46">It played drama in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sex-related and bullying allegations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the legendary GBs, which has reached its peak for the perfect moment, can be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland due to the lifting of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of Portland's aluminium melting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - is at stake as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract, thereby lifting all supply contracts, as the supplier of energy.</seg>
<seg id="3">That move followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 20-year subsidy expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No fewer than 2,000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moreover, domino effects could occur as melting consumes around 10 percent of Victorias' total power generation.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry meltdown, leading to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa's meltdown in Portland is losing money and risking closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelting with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects three other owners to terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through melting," the company said.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "security deals" that should have come into effect from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"From that point of view, AGL assumes that contracts will contribute 17 to revenue in the fiscal year," the power supplier said.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on revenue on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual deal of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts did not affect Alcoas "ability to operate the meltdown or to ensure the power supply to the meltdown."</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even though it is still guilty of a statement as to why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn about the industry's poor economic conditions ahead of the possible closure of the Portland meltdown in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">Referring to the analyst's statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consume about 600 megawatts and tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity each year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us as a power generator, that wouldn't be good, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue</seg>
<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, who is brand ambassador to Estee Lauder and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to wine," Kendall wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The unveiling of the Covers followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), spelled reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problems Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the most popular Showbiz Onkings.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the climate-related act of almost every birthday pisode of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You dazed that we had forgotten you?" With the honesty of a cartoon canine on a Senate pitch at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's great sister Kim may have beaten her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were due to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for herself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most widely sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With an extent that resembles a picture band rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista was advertising from the 832 pages of the rolling house 615 pages).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his coach is so eagerly awaited that pictures of the magazine have leaked before the official announcement in the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, clearly more "celebrities who model" than "models that are celebrities" were on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the low chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even though it's all on Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who are emerging in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the release of lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mistbits of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">Those feelings boiled up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But moving on to resentment seems to be at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the true sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your congratulations to Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her spare time she is seen on reality TV, presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="1">Local council centers dismiss 160,000 people a year</seg>
<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the country's needs for assistance are dismissed annually by local council centres, while the industry is grappling with the impact of further cuts on already overloaded transactions.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those with no resources for unjust dolphins and the like - are already being dismissed in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Legal services from the community, which are already overly outlawed, are preparing for further cuts.</seg>
<seg id="5">As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.</seg>
<seg id="6">The director of Queesland's community centers James Farrell said the latest survey by the National Association of Local Government Centres showed that thousands of people are already being turned away every year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government's decision.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Queensland council centers are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from important services you need," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families who go through divisions, workers who have been unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows they cannot get the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">The federal government will cut funds by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning that thousands of vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We call on the Attorney General and Federal Justice Department, as well as Senators of Queensland George Brandis, to lift these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need on legal issues.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is now time to look at the needs of local community centres and their customer communities and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump election campaign charged after staff allegedly pulled gun</seg>
<seg id="2">New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina turned a firearm on an employee in February while traveling in a jeep in February.</seg>
<seg id="3">The incident is described in a indictment filed Wednesday in the National Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bordini admitted waiting months for the matter to be settled internally before realising that "that would not happen."</seg>
<seg id="5">The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a gun, put his right index finger on the deduction, and rammed the run in Vincents Kniekehle," Bordini admitted in his charge.</seg>
<seg id="6">After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he admitted in the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause harm," Bordini admitted.</seg>
<seg id="8">The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" - gun owners and gun friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and judges should appoint.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bordini's complaint requires damages from the campaign for violating due diligence and from Philip for bodily injury and lasting mental damage.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trump's press secretary Hope Hicks was unavailable for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="12">Attempts to contact Philip also failed.</seg>
<seg id="13">WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="14">Calls from his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, did not respond.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far waged a controversial campaign.</seg>
<seg id="16">The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).</seg>

<seg id="2">In the forthcoming elections in the LÃ¤nder of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses are recorded for the governing parties SPD and CDU.</seg>
<seg id="3">This gave representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-and-black ruling coalition in the north could run narrowly further, this is not possible, according to polls in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both federal states, though, the SPD would be the strongest party, and thus would have good chances of continuing to face the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD plunged from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">The party was just ahead of the CDU, according to the survey, which could return to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">Third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the country's day.</seg>

<seg id="11">NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 percent each in the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the Berlin parliamentary election, the SPD, according to the poll, would only be 23% (election in 2011: 28.3%).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU gained only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">They were still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but off the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>

<seg id="2">E-mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came onto the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty knocking.</seg>
<seg id="7">Built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would now range for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet, but they somehow come from the stone age of the Internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an "office in the West End format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone was able to reach a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the Communicator to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit agonizing slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the phone could be turned up similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then found a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, that's about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was â¬392 in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could expect the Communicator to become the start of the smartphone era in August 1996.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then, everything has been different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finn mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold and handled to Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market dominates today, all of which came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always and everywhere online, that's today for a lot of people everyday.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 1.4 billion devices were sold, with Samsung and Apple alone accounting for 555 million pieces.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales of devices are around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">This includes the well-running operations of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Around the smartphone, an entire industry has now emerged.</seg>
<seg id="31">The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, then Apple chief executive Steve Jobs on the Mac World announced the launch of the iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: A music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, to use everything easily by touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple's winning streak began, yet today the iPhone is the group's most important product.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, had the afterthought.</seg>
<seg id="35">They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has struggled.</seg>
<seg id="36">The shots now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a self-evident 20 years after its invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">On average, every German now looks on his mobile 88 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all need to learn to get rid of the smartphone," said just Janina Kugel, on the Siemens board of staff.</seg>
<seg id="40">Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this represented Heathrows' biggest attraction, just as it was in 2012 in London, when we ran a big effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local and local businesses near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement Heathrows is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overwinds, but Heathrow answers every question it asks.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.</seg>
<seg id="12">Enlargement is one way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, Â£211 billion in grassroots growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented an Â£11bn infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which was chosen five years in a row to become the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, built amid the world's two most frequent running tracks.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third grade, supported by Â£16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London Games have been a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass ad blocking are equal to a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad closures on its desktop, Adblock Plus released a blog post in which it said users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop site would change coding regarding its advertising ads to make it more difficult to identify which part of the page is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of neck-and-neck fight between the landmark Open Source community and the converters has already been under way since the invention of advertisers," and that it is possible Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying advertisers have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, about 200 million people use advertisers; almost four times as much in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company has put it on display blockers on desktop PCs as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient proportion of revenue, so Facebook appears to be worth investing such a move.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preference tool" to give people more control over advertising aimed at them.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Facebook claimed Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.</seg>
<seg id="14">"For users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," a spokesman for Facebook said in an e-mail message.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ad blockers are a blunt means, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.</seg>

<seg id="1">Woman charged with suspected suicide on Swiss highway</seg>
<seg id="2">The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police are calling for witnesses after a woman was rushed to a highway in the early morning hours Thursday in a suspected suicide from several vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in Canton Waadt shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman put herself on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, police in Waadt said.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a welder aged 49 who was overpowered by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She still died locally.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said police, calling on them as well as any witnesses to the incident to report.</seg>
<seg id="9">An investigation has been opened into what is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision preventable?</seg>
<seg id="12">That's something the prosecutor needs to decide, "Hofstetter said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - where one person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists did not have to assume that a pedestrian was running on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a policeman of the negligent killing was acquitted after crossing and killing a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014 one night.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had been drunk and has become unconscious on the street, the court took over.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove in a justifiable way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone with more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44.</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus was probably once habitable, according to projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and carbon-dense atmosphere, could once have applied earth-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly moved on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet presumably had more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protect against rapid darkening.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matt.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In the Giss model simulation, the slow turn of Venus exposed its daylight side of the sun for nearly two months," Giss scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was once presumably habitable, Venus -- over several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans darkened and her water vapour was burned away from the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as coach and vice president of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche and introduced too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="3">Alternatively president / general manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will seek a new coach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," 50-year-old Roy said in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="5">I've spent a long time and a lot of time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, need it and get it to a higher level.</seg>
<seg id="6">To achieve this, the team's vision and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly tuned to that of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="7">He must also have a co-determination right in decisions that affect the team's performance.</seg>
<seg id="8">These conditions are not currently met.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Patrick informed me today about this decision," Sakic said.</seg>
<seg id="11">We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">Roy was awarded as the best coach in the league during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14.</seg>
<seg id="13">He led the club to 112 points and to first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild-card spot in the Western Conference by five points.</seg>

<seg id="2">Labor struggles over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all contenders are set to table a new round of talks, negotiators said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Strikes against oil field service provider Wood Group have been conducted sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Woods Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute," it said in a joint statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will hold some full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin early next year to retackle the problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">Unions said their last strike, the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Woods Group this year cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent because of negative market pressure.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company's rate cut follows a 10-percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shell has sacked thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it rationalizes its business activities as a result of its megagement with British energy company BG Group.</seg>
<seg id="11">Energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices, an economic situation reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Plejaden's star home.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data will help astronomers understand why stars rotate at different rates in the startup and in what context the rotation periods are related to planetary development.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The chapel of the Plejaden is 445 light years from Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star shop, which was created about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates, these mature stars have large amounts of star winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is ageing, his rotation rate begins to slow.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures each star's rotation rate by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star fleece -- like sunflecks.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are turning more slowly than fewer massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In the" Ballet "of the Plejaden, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the plot's startup is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The star bunch of the Plejaden offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still much ahead of us about what we would like to know more about how the How, When and Why Stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their "dance shoes."</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues have detailed in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the plejads' rotation rates, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="1">A controversial baseball star resigns</seg>
<seg id="2">Tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from Base to Base.</seg>
<seg id="3">After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old pro will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays one last time.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say 'Goodbye' to bite," explained the 14-time All-Star Game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).</seg>
<seg id="6">Three times Rodriguez was elected the league's most valuable player, he won the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="7">His signature under a 10-year contract gave him $27 million a year since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will continue to act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a player, Rodriguez paid back a long time with performance.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees created a few milestones.</seg>
<seg id="11">With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in key statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">But into the baseball's fame hall, the 41-year-old is still unlikely to be included.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because so successful Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.</seg>
<seg id="14">As early as 2009, the superstar admitted at "ESPN" to having banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013, he was banned for 211 matches due to a winding-up in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received high-performance funding for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.</seg>
<seg id="17">Following a dispute, the ban was still reduced to 162 encounters.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The league might even have done me a favor for 2014, because I've been through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said sweetly at the time.</seg>
<seg id="19">His farewell days don't go silent either.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.</seg>
<seg id="21">"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."</seg>
<seg id="22">"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi estimated.</seg>
<seg id="23">After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and was told the relationship with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from fans from Yankee arch-rival Boston Red Sox.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We want A-Rod," the supporters sang at the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: Due to a positive doping test, thunderstorm Adrian Zielinski from Poland cannot start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">An errant athlete would almost have won a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known to the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa of Bulgaria and Polish thunderstorm Adrian Zielinski were tested positively and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically-acclaimed athletics competitions, these news comes to an untime.</seg>
<seg id="7">At Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazid was already proven last Sunday, which is used as a masquerading tool for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon local time.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old took fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have taken part in the lead over 50 m Freistil.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</seg>
<seg id="12">The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment."</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also on the night of Rio leaked the news about the positive sample at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth Test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she told Bulgarian TV station BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">She was innocent "the only explanation could be food supplements," the athlete explained.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance is to be EPO blood doping.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B sample is expected to have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation so many have already been ruled out."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all thunderstorms from the chronically dopingladen nation must not take part in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski," the London-based Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg, was also announced as his brother Tomasz tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny taking, but both may not start in class until 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of athletics, the Danekowa case is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The International Association of IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from launching until an exception because of systematic doping, including the LÃ¤ufernation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming, the earlier offences in China also ensured fierce clashes between athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Sun Yang pinkels purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"When I see the podium about 200 m freistil, I want to pass," Lacourt said on French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also at the heart of a clash with Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," said this.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was tested positive for the Stimulans trimetazidin in 2014 at the Chinese championships, but only had to sit off a three-month ban.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data feud: So perfide hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of companies surveyed have been killed at least once in the past 12 months, in part several times by an attack involving blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a Ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">Forty per cent of victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to reuse the systems and data that were being accessed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Offenders specialize in their blackmail software, according to Malwarebytes' observations, to attacks on corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially extortionable ransom is significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are currently seeing a terrifying rapid evolution of malicious software," Malwarebytes chief executive Marcin Kleczynski explains in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks took place alarmingly quickly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files, and archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and solves the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blacksmith.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end key code to the files, victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users are at stake the personal photo database, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage will be higher if a Ransomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">Twenty-one percent of the German firms affected reported revenue losses from Ransomware, while 13 percent even had to cut business completely, in one case people were in danger of living.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We always tell the victims: Don't pay, you just promote the problem," Kleczynski explains.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject offenders' demand in the face of deadlock in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers, in turn, know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure's security researchers looked at the user's areas and contact with the expressors and come to the conclusion: Offenders are actually trying to build some kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims via chat how to pay by Bitcoin, create freely accessible support websites or decrypt example files in vain.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are replaced after payments of a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from Ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more professional and share the work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a Ransomware about a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, however, is that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software building kit to the actual blacksmith.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-off, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Included in the delivery range is an adjustment tool, so smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blacksmiths then seek more hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in to one of the forums underground, buy the set from a criminal and then hire another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Usually the criminals then instruct Spammer with the spread," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ransomware's risk is now well known to many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of corporate IT executives in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to fend off Ransomware using file-back and scanning software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful erasing, the offenders will instead face the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes chief executive Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">As a result, the loss potential is much higher than before depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also set completely new targets on the Internet of Things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hacking conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat associated with the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offenders then block an entire manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating, Ransomware could also become an issue in industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually proving to be very flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V looks rather small, passengers have plenty of space in both the front row and the rear, it doesn't work closely at all.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit upper side falls off there.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a trunk of 453 l at high-level and 1026 l at converted backrests, but there are the Magic Seats.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: The seat areas of the backbench can be mounted like cinema chairs, thus providing storage space that is 1.24 m high from the ground to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-litre diesel tested with 88 kW / 120 horsepower accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is likely to do his job somewhat quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another motorization: A 1.5-litre petrol station with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">Driving is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the steering is likely to be slightly more direct.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the motorway passenger</seg>
<seg id="2">It regularly dust on the bypass - here's a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But that is to change: The right-hand holder is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all motorists who are in a traffic jam every night on the environmental road when they drive over the motorway (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The state-run road building extends the legal highway at 700 meters next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between Hammer Street and the Weseler StraÃe exit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Motorists can then brush right from Hammer Street.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: Traffic is more rapid, improving the overall flow on the multi-vehicle section of the BundesstraÃe 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU Group in the district representative MÃ¼nster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trajectory on the feeder annoys motorists especially between 5pm and 7pm.</seg>
<seg id="10">The backlog extends to the bridge above the Albersloher Way and sometimes beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason is the needle on the B 51 just before the Weseler Street exit.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, traffic will only be diverted over the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be rebuilt well over a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary force to absorb heavy goods traffic two-way.</seg>
<seg id="15">How long this bottleneck and the related working day-to-day congestion will not be able to say the relevant state operation.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, years can be expected: Because the bridge has an official residual life until 2034.</seg>
<seg id="17">In order to extend the right-hand lease, the local company deliberately sought out the weaker time in the school holidays because it is likely to be disabled.</seg>

<seg id="1">Recovering night: Tips against sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you get around forever, at night you get awake, and in the morning you can't think of sleep well before the Weckerbell.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is far from relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, such problems are in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep is frequent or permanent.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on a variety of causes, says Hans-GÃ¼nter WeeÃ, a member of the Management Board of the German Society for Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But what you can understand about it is the insomnie, that is, an injunction and sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely this that many people find unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Board of Directors of the German Medical Association with practice in the Dutch Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">This can contain organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not rare that sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Very early awakening is common especially in a depression," WeeÃ says.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors match each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a band failure, you can be bad, wake up every two to three hours and start grinning about everyday problems and concerns, WeeÃ gives an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you have sleep problems with a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who don't sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected on the day should go to the doctor, wee.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look very different: One is cut off, tired, uncut, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Among other things, behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, or even drugs - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are hardly any established sleep doctors in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of CharitÃ© University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, you should first contact the doctor in case of sleep problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be explained with studies of whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">In order to study in the sleep lab, physicians advise, for example, in snoring with respiratory agents, in sickbay fatigue, in sleep converters or if you don't find the cause of a distress disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">We do not really need to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Just don't make a lunch sleep," Fietze says.</seg>
<seg id="30">After dressing you go to bed at your normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a nose, a chest belt and a fiber on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling features the sleeping end.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get to grips with the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of pitches to be set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">There is a regular sleep and sleep time, not too long in bed, not sleep in the day, not a TV to sleep, drink and not watch the clock at night.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented via Facebook on the disappointing cut of the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the short-track world championships in Doha, setting his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has been protecting himself from his critical ex-teammates via Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In a country where an Olympic champion is getting Â£20,000 and a jungle man's Â£150,000 should no one be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on the night of Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The support system for swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">We cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look very closely or even operate on doping.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I'm not saying that checks should be stopped here," he continued.</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to launch a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">That is precisely how countries should keep it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, also a rest of the cobblestones: The Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at first sight, but the police are one of the city's "dangerous places."</seg>
<seg id="2">Take the road from east to west, get past playgrounds, a fresh kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">To the facade of a gray house, someone sprayed "ugly!"</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of a Lidl, which is also to be demolished soon, it is already being built: A house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be created by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy district," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain said, are preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: Once occupied, the inhabitants now have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Berlin interior senator, Henkel, in particular, had argued several times since the beginning of the year for a crackdown by the police against the project, calling the area a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterforge, had been cleared with 300 police officers, patrolling three weeks of official testimony, with 30 to 40 officers and three man's cars on the ground, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house by number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, building workers on behalf of unknown homeowners renovated the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the cheer of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road acts peacefully: Parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, and others entertain themselves in front of the speleti.</seg>
<seg id="12">A primary school and nursery are close to home projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, are mainly made up of the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With residents of home projects sharing concerns about rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiev that, by the majority, wanted police protection from the vanishing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and police make up between domestic workers and their neighbors, appears to be unavailable.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, many houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all of Mainz Street near Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While Mainzer had been cleared under large police orders in a real street battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and polling travelers from all over the world: With them, residents from GDR times and former domestic workers share their jaw.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also evident in rents, which have risen by nearly 60 per cent since 2009 in new rentals.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: They are recognized by inserted slices or freshly coated facades, which have been covered with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-wing violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: According to statistics, crimes such as injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes make up property damage, which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated homes.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house for 17 years alongside the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is striking: The people of 94 are their neighbours, who have certainly not been.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn to Rigaer Street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important that residents get their street back: From the police, politics and the media, which all suddenly claimed the German sovereignty over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to take them away: Through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that oust old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"These are, after all, condominiums that are not interesting to many here - here are more people who are not so well covered," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Violence and destruction I absolutely cannot approve of."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to one?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including with police and residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding of the home projects and the left-hand scene.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come here should be aware of it - just like someone who moves to a pub district can complain badly about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social education teacher supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact point for all actors: Refugees, refugee workers, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine's client from the working group suggests that the honorary officials are more than grateful, that Deuschle is now there, the icing wool milchsau, which has a problem in particular.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some people - less mockery than they were aimed at the multitude of areas of ambition - thought when the administration wanted to run the post.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administrative team with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, has been sought.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not her central area, according to Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has limited a 50 per cent post to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It was high time," Regine customer says, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon to stand new containers in WasenstraÃe</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognised.</seg>
<seg id="18">Local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility changes from the county board to the commune and the job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find private housing.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has not worked so far, relying on private housing, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings must be exploited, as is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So new containers will soon be set up in WasenstraÃe.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customers and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent lead, they are internships, training centres, school places, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants who need to be flattened or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"More places would be good," Regine told customers.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the Bauhof or help caregivers, do nonprofit work - and that motivates and very proper, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "not employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">However, activity does not just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People should develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here, too, administration and honorary officials are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees feel that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You have to explain to the refugees that it is just going to take time to bridge it, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who at some point develop the feeling that they can't help anyone in Urbach should not work and be unsure that they will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people who are not at all doing anything," so the work of Deuschle and customer is always motivated by others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All of this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">One difficult question: Do the two have fear of radicalisation following recent events, including in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"No," says Regine's customer quite clearly, "what some might call naive," but one residual risk cannot and does not want to exclude it.</seg>
<seg id="50">But aid workers are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would be afraid that the bombers would completely dismiss them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"They want to show they have nothing to do with it," Regine customer says.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
