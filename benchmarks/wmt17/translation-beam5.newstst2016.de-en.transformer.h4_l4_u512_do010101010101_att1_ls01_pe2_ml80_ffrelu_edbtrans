Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran &apos;s destabilising measures in the Middle East .
however , the meeting will also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington criticises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process .
the Obama @-@ led deal on Iran &apos;s nuclear program has further worsened the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of Republicans before the U.S. Congress , Netanyahu delivered a controversial speech , partly considered an affront to Obama .
the speech was not disagreed with Obama ; a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election in Israel at the time .
in an emergency call , Professor admits he shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Shannon Lamb told police with a slightly treacherous voice that he shot his girlfriend and that officers would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still living and probably excited , and he said the dead woman &apos;s family contacts could be found on the phone .
inside the house , officials found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a hand @-@ written note that had been cracked on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted to , I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me , &quot; according to the authorities in the letter he signed .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , Ethan Schmidt , at the door to his office , according to police .
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 a.m.
he said Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that .
by the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when police boarded him .
a day after the shootings in the university that forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors , authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details released by investigators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal prehistory .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teachers include 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inclinations to problematic behavior .
one student , Brandon Beavers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little excited and nervous &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mikel Sykes , said Lamm told him he had to deal with stress at the end of the 2014 @-@ 15 academic year .
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for an assessment on health grounds , saying he had any health problem .
this year , he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not provide him with a guarantee of an automatic path to an appointment as assistant professor .
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr. Lambs &apos;s imagination . &quot;
these are questions Lamb can no longer answer .
after fleeing campus , police later found Lambs lane when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; house on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said .
his car was still running in the driveway .
it was not immediately clear why Lamm went to this house , but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 residents and taught geography and pedagogy .
he received a doctorate in pedagogy in spring .
one of Lambs &apos; longtime girlfriends described him as intelligent , charismatic and funny .
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when they met through shared friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game .
he was the women &apos;s swarm at the time .
all the girls melted up when he was there , &quot; said Hairston , now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon .
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , Lamb said &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage .
they had a dog called Lightning , who lived with them in the brick house , bordering a Bayou in Gautier .
police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Prentiss , Shawn O &apos;Steen , said they were divorced 15 years ago but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; O &apos;Steen said about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;Steen said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both joined a summer vintage market three years ago .
they later played together one gig or another .
O &apos;Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Shaffer , a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room , a weakly lit bar near Gautier , said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmonic aspiel before an audience .
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on the cleanup and joked to each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of jokes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
at the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening , about 900 people , including faculty , staff , students and members of the community attended a candlelight memorial ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the memorial service , while the university &apos;s &quot; Bright Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will resume on Wednesday .
&quot; we &apos;re trying to move our students to return , &quot; LaForge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
that story was corrected to reflect that police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamm , in his emergency call , called Prentiss his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plans to hire less labor for Christmas
Toys R Us says it won &apos;t hire as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give the current staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country , while still hiring 45,000 workers in the Christmas 2014 period .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will begin application talks this month and that staff numbers will rise from October to December .
while the holidays themselves are months away , the Christmas business is moving closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox jokes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was professionally a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Royals , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually make me realise that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I &apos;m a simulated sewing and an armesh length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; Spielberg said , &quot; undisputed the biggest time @-@ travel film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be seen on VOD , DVD and in selected cinemas in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; to the nearly five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only aggravate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief again calls on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations to finalise a political solution .
ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the council &apos;s five permanent member nations - US , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
he regretted that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers &quot; make this situation intractable . &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the Syrian crisis as they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 polls showing that Donald Trump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a breakdown .
but no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks at polls down , it hasn &apos;t ( yet ) worked .
ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump in the double digits , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate moguls .
of course , it is too early in the parliamentary term .
no one claims Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry &apos;s leadership was handed over to rising Herman Cain , none of whom won either state in the nominating process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outsiders like Jeb Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump &apos;s perseverance and begin to flow their dollars to topple him .
here are some current poll results indicating that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase :
Trump &apos;s popularity ratings have turned around 180 degrees .
just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid @-@ June , a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of 10 Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
in early August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump .
about three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion .
and those numbers are holding in early states .
a Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump .
two @-@ thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates .
in a CNN / ORC poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Trump were nominated .
only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; upset &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be &quot; dissatisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if Jeb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would become the candidate .
a majority of Republicans don &apos;t see Trump &apos;s temperament as a problem .
while Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tending to Republicans believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president , according to ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the nation &apos;s first pre @-@ election state , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander , according to Quinnipiac last week .
still , 44 percent think he doesn &apos;t have the personality to perform effectively , and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn &apos;t fit into the White House , according to ABC / Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their casual hats , Republican voters think Trump is real .
when asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , according to a CNN / ORC poll last week , four out of ten say Trump is the best bet .
that &apos;s been a change since the time when four out of 10 put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July .
full disclosure : GOP voters haven &apos;t had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to just 28 % for final candidate Mitt Romney .
still , a variety of GOP voters view Trump &apos;s campaign as plausible .
even when Republicans gathered around another candidate , Trump still beats almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump &apos;s leadership , while anti @-@ Trump support is diffuse among more than a dozen other candidates .
but a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates , Trump reaped majority support .
he added 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina , ahead of Marco Rubio 14 points , ahead of Walker &apos;s 15 points , before Jeb Bush scored 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate beating him ?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new poll by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters supporting Trump say they have firmly forgiven their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that and no one can really say never to change opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
yet Trump &apos;s strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider , neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Trump .
six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration .
since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rapist &quot; in his campaign speech two months ago , immigration has been the hub of public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that Trump &apos;s bombastic expression will keep crucial Hispano Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage reorientation efforts .
but according to Monday &apos;s new ABC / Post poll , six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues .
so as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Trump seems to be doing it .
frustration over the government is climbing to new highs .
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half the support of Republican voters , especially through their outsider status .
six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC / Post &apos;s new Monday poll they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience .
and they &apos;re also angry at Washington .
a poll by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by Republicans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; unhappy &quot; and 21 percent &quot; politely upset . &quot;
Munich , Sylt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
here in the Hobookenweg there is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea Lake .
in the street , a square metre of a reef house costs an average of 73,300 euros .
&quot; on Sylt , the supply of objects is naturally limited , &quot; the study states - hence the high price .
a new study shows where special layers cost one square metre most .
of course , 18.70 euros per square metre for a student bude in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top residential areas , one of the price comes as peanuts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices at staggering heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros nix - per square metre , well noted .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way , Munich is not at the top here for once .
champions League : Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
two @-@ man goalscorer in Piräus : Bayern star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3 @-@ 0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then ran .
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in Piräus .
the team of coach Pep Guardiola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record @-@ holder Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to garbage &apos;s double pack ( 52nd / 90th + 2 ) and Götzes hits ( 89th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the 12th starter in the series is expected to be the first step toward the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third inning .
Muller received amicable support from Olympic goalkeeper Roberto during his 28th match in the Champions League to Bayern &apos;s lead , which made one shot of the world champion as a flanker .
&quot; we won &apos;t underestimate them , &quot; Bayern captain Philipp Lahm promised before the game at Karaiskakis Stadium before 31.688 hot @-@ blooded fans - and the Munich kept word .
they showed a focused and committed performance without gleaming .
Piräus had won his recent six home games in the premier class , including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United , Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin .
in 2011 Borussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stumbled here .
but Bayern , in seven Europacup duels with Greek teams undefeated , did not want to be the next victim .
they bravely ran , but often too inventive to work in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were launched too often by playback on left @-@ arm Douglas Costa , who rarely came through against former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui .
Müller was more lucky from the right than his flank hit from the right half @-@ field in the left upper toreck .
in the 67th minute , the world champion gave up the possible 2 @-@ 0 .
the best opportunities in half had Robert Lewandowski .
first , when Olympic striker Ideye Brown beat Poland &apos;s head ball from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the goalkeeper Roberto parked with the knee ( 35 . )
although Bayern pulled up their usual dominant game , Piräus was able to set needles .
on goalkeeper Manuel Neuer , though , was forgiveness .
for example , when he steered a shot of Ideye over the latte ( 56 ) .
before Neuer allowed Guardiola to defend a four @-@ stroke lead with David Alaba in the centre alongside Jerome Boateng , who made it good .
Mario Götze , after muscular problems back in the caddie , sat out first .
the World Cup hero only gave the go @-@ ahead after finishing training , said sports director Matthias Sammer at Sky : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already malicious . &quot;
even at the first change , Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the troubled Lewandowski ( 59 ) .
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal ( 76th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by penalty Müller still put one up .
before the game , riots had occurred at the stadium .
after a smaller group of partially mumbled Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the followers of host Piräus with words and gestures , the security forces intervened and went with batons against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was transported injured from the stadium .
who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke do not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : in the event of waiver , the risk drops quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is reflected in the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several staff from the German Institute for Food Research ( DIfE ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , the risk of losing their teeth prematurely was 2.5- to 3.6 @-@ ounce higher .
scientists had watched more than 23,300 participants .
the main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammation of the gum , the DIfE stresses .
for these parodontitis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress .
the link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore based on more frequent tooth infections in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries .
people who stopped smoking , however , could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers wrote in the Journal of Dental Research .
however , it could take more than ten years to return to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Erstautor Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
one has to convince people to become non @-@ smokers , said University Manager Heiner Boeing of the DIfE : &quot; smoking shortens the lifetime . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health right up to the high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 is affected by toothlessness , the DIfE said .
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure .
the new long @-@ term study underpins the findings .
archaeologists encounter Kölner Rheinufer on remnants from late ancient times
once again archaeological finds have been made at the right Rhine in Cologne .
near the building site for the new Rhine boulevard , archaeologists at the Roman @-@ German Museum of Skelette and remnants of historic buildings have dug out , museum director Marcus Trier said Tuesday .
since the start of construction on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
for all construction projects in the city of Cologne , the museum is always included as a specialist office for archeological soil conservation .
in the third section of the Rhine boulevards , archaeologists have now been found .
it was already known from text documents that in the 4th century there was a fortress and a church in the 8th century , Trier explained .
in addition to remnants of the fortress and church tower , a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered , which was probably part of the church .
young woman covered by freight train
after a young woman was unhappy at the train station in Geilenkirchen @-@ Lindern , the Federal Police are asking the population for help .
early Wednesday morning at around 1.40 p.m. , the woman crossed from the direction of the railway station building at the end of the railway strip and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach .
by capturing the train , she sustained serious injuries , according to federal police .
she was treated in need of medical treatment and taken to hospital by rescue workers .
the reason for the late @-@ night crossing of the young woman is that there is no evidence available to the senior officials .
the incident may have been watched by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions .
in question are residents or passers @-@ by from Linderner Bahn , Ziegelbäckerweg , Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße ( L364 ) .
information about the cause of the accident can be provided under 24 @-@ hour and free hotline of the Federal Police at 0800 / 6888000 or any other police station .
Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
to defuse the dispute over the planned TTIP transatlantic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system .
the controversial private arbitration institutions for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system , which corresponds to far more traditional courts in its functioning .
&quot; we want to establish a system that citizens trust , &quot; said Cecilia Malmström , EU Commissioner responsible .
Swedin intends to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TTIP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade area with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically provide that the EU countries and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
they will come from the EU , the US and third countries alike .
there is also a second instance for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against judgments .
so far , the parties to the proceedings have agreed with each other on arbitrators , and there has been no objection to their judgments .
commenting on the debate over the past few months , Commissioner Malmström commented .
in the long term , it intends to work on an international investment court , according to its own information .
disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could then be resolved .
the investor @-@ state arbitration ( ISDS ) procedure , which was mainly required by large corporations , is considered one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe to TTIP .
traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , over which companies seek damages at the expense of taxpayers , wipe out national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
first opinions identified anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Campact as inadequate to the Commission &apos;s proposals .
it was mainly criticised for not applying the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( CETA ) .
on the other hand , German Minister for Economic Affairs Matthias MACHNIG ( SPD ) described the plans as a major step forward .
the Commission takes into account key elements of the reform drawn up by Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel in the spring with other EU Trade Ministers .
the old system of private arbitrators is off the table .
the French Government also welcomed Malmström &apos;s plans .
the European Business Association BusinessEurope warned that too many new rules would restrict business appeal .
small and medium @-@ sized enterprises in particular could be penalised .
when talks on the TTIP ( Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) FTA can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
initially , a framework for the agreement should be in place at the end of this year .
this date is considered no longer sustainable .
delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( now : Luxor ) .
next to him is a flipchart on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with a film pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly taken by Stevens talk .
he tells from various places he keeps recording on the map , which his minutiae and tender arranged songs report .
where they were born and what it looks like there , in his home .
since then , Stevens has proved to be a wonderfully creative Irishman .
with the album &quot; Greetings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; published in 2003 and the third album , &quot; Greetings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; sounds cleverly composed songs that are harmoniously very close to American folk of the late 1960s , but can drift into great opulence at any time .
there is a rumor that &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a weathered series : each of the 50 US states should be kept in succession .
but &quot; Seven Swans &quot; has already appeared in 2004 and in Rhineland .
Stevens is reduced here .
live meets him guitar and banjo .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Sufjan Stevens Invites You To : come on Feel The Illinoise &quot; ) , a nationally acclaimed masterpiece will be released in 2005 .
superseding ideas and stylistic finesse .
the album rises into the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , Stevens then uses &quot; The Age of Adz &quot; ( 2010 ) to produce very extensive electronic sales .
this sixth proper studio album is still widely orchestrated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and Hall .
the stage shows will become the colourful spectacle of Neon forehead bands and large fluorescent stages .
currently , Sufjan Stevens is touring as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the dark hamburger More !
he mainly presents the &quot; Carrie &amp; Lowell &quot; available since March .
although nearly 2,000 guests are now locked in their chairs , the significantly matured Stevens returns to intimacy and folk .
without giving a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album .
from the audience you hear : the talk is &quot; opulent &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; plate . &quot;
Stevens &apos;s humble , acoustically plays few older songs and finally misses himself under dead applause .
Jeremy Corbyn &apos;s debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Questions
since his election , Mr Corbyn &apos;s debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Question Time is eagerly awaited
new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Question Time and set up with David Cameron for the first time .
MR Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six set questions shortly after noon , with his performance being considered by the media likely and Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; fewer theaters and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could skip some meetings to leave them colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn &apos;s leadership , because it comes after being appointed a member of the Shadow Cabinet and following his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour chairman &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the sinking of the national anthem at a memorial ceremony on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the heart of several front page stories in the newspapers .
MR Corbyn &apos;s decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had &quot; stood in respectful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the Royal Air Force &apos;s &quot; heroism in the air battle for England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Corbyn &apos;s shadow cabinet , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two Newsnight programme he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem &quot; regardless &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn &apos;s top team , invoking differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader .
the BBC &apos;s political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also &quot; stacking up &quot; within Labour , according to Mr Corbyn &apos;s remarks on the position on the European Union and limiting profits .
MR Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is proposing changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow labor and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to cut the limit from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000 .
MR Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron since he is Tory chief , over the Dispatch box in parliament in the last decade .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy approach , says he has &quot; crowd @-@ sourced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s Question Time is too confrontational , and that he will refrain from both &quot; buzziness &quot; and contending with reluctance and has instead undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
MR Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economics minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example , if Mr Cameron is traveling abroad .
he has also raised the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor , and that he raised John Bercow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasperle theatre , &quot; often linked to Prime Minister &apos;s Question Time , but a few years later he acknowledged that he had failed to do so .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of a leader &apos;s judgment and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his fellow MPs , although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and that it needs far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound rises amid accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound rose skyrocketing , according to data showing a rise in UK wage growth , and in parallel the FTSE 100 was boosted by the bidding target SABMiller .
between May and July , earnings excluding bonuses grew by 2.9 % in the UK compared to the same period last year .
this percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and has received assessments about the timing of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.5505 and had climbed to 0.84 % against the euro to € 1.3730 .
the FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49 % to 6,229.21 .
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a 20 % jump after taking on rival AB InBev .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser , Stella Artois , Peroni and Grolsch .
Burberry shares were 0.9 % higher after encouraging news from the rival group for luxury goods Richemont .
Richemon &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are reporting growth again .
shares of Glencore rose 5 % after the mining giant said it took $ 2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
shares in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index , with a 4.3 % fall after Goldman Sachs set its valuation for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
JD Sports rose 3.1 % after the sports industry reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 46.6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of JD Sports says higher wages threaten expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company , he says .
the cost could hit JD Sports &apos;s expansion plans , he added , and that could mean there are fewer extra jobs .
Justin Bieber in the Capital : on Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber , Megastar .
smiling 21 years young , a hangout with top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line frise .
the type with the platinblonde hair is 100 million euros heavy .
more so .
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin .
and generation U17 turns through .
like Wiktoria Rudzinska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; Ritz Carlton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans escorted Justin yesterday .
including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland .
since 7am , however , the polin has been sitting on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz .
the Bieber construction : here &apos;s where her idol , whose posters hang on in Stettin , has been living since Monday night .
the suite where the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much a day as her mum Ewa earns in half a year .
if anything .
which says : &quot; actually my Wiktoria would have to sit in the 10th grade in grammar school . &quot;
&quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot;
school duty ?
who &apos;s cheering ?
the fans don &apos;t .
Bieber himself does not .
this has already ensured .
for the reclamation in the Superbowl &apos;s advertising break , he cashed in three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ pickup company splitting many , many dollars to the Bieber account .
and with every doll that looks like him and goes over the ladder , Bieber is also cashing in .
when Justin Bieber drinks a coffee , you are amazed at the window screen .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hype was too far .
others stress that Bieber is finally ranked No. 1 in the US and Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot;
Bieber himself , whose fourth album is due to follow in November , is not interested in the many zeros first time .
at least he does .
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to potato beans idea
potatoes or dyes ?
it &apos;s both - and in the potato beet developed by Oldenburger snack owner Hani Alhay .
inspired by the splendour &quot; potato instead of Döner &quot; on a poster of the Pegida movement , Alhay potato and meat put together on a mirror .
on the idea brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription &quot; Potatoes instead of Döner , &quot; which he had happened to see on television .
since then , in his shop , a barbecue mirror has turned up , topped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multiculti for the stomach , &quot; says Alhay .
the idea has now been registered with the Patent Office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as a utility pattern , according to the authority .
as to how much meat and how much potatoes the mirror contains , Alhay does not want to betray .
just so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds .
the culinary understanding is also good for its customers .
Metcash launches ground resistance campaign to fight aldi-
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground industry campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million Aldi invasion .
while Aldi prepares to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media , as well as through events such as Adelaide show .
IGA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as ice maker Simmo from Dunsborough , who distributes samples in IGA stores and shopkeepers selling leveraged tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholesaler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day .
there is a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash &apos;s IGA shopkeepers and generate higher profit margins than Metcash &apos;s IGA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the East states .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will snap away about five per cent of the food market in these two states 12 months after opening its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mostly self @-@ employed retailers .
according to a report released this week , analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $ 360 million in sales per year and Metcash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Metcash &apos;s high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash about $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , Mr Kierath said .
at the same time , Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states , mainly to Aldi and Coles , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley notes that Metcash &apos;s sales in the food and food business will fall 3.8 percent in 2016 , down 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , leading fund manager Hamish Douglass , the founder of the Magellan Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash would likely disappear within a decade .
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr Douglass last week .
IGAS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 , and revenue from Metcash &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers , has fallen 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction at the same time on sales and margins .
however , the wholesaler is wrestling and investing more than $ 150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers &apos; ability to improve their stores through fast @-@ growing fresh food and deliver better choice of private label foods .
Metcash &apos;s chief executive , Ian Morrice , says the price adjustments and store remediation programs will come to Elan and hopes the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by the president of Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the &quot; collateral damage &quot; in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and , according to the president of Australian tennis federation Steve Healy , deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour .
Kokkinakis , the younger of the talented duo , who is repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special Ks , &quot; got into the spotlight by Kyrgios &apos; infamous clash with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after , Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee , with Harrison calling out : &quot; Wawrinka would have to beat Kyrgios and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen smashing a tennis bat after a cramp thwarted a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gasquet , Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy .
the teenager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Britain .
&quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty concerned about is the fact that , in my view , Thanasi was dragged a little into the dispute , &quot; Healy said .
he smashed a racket when he lost because of a tie in the U.S. Open , but he &apos;s not the first player to have a racket of frustration with himself , and I know Thanasi well enough to know he &apos;s not proud of it .
but , really , he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open , even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he has been treated a little too tightly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is respected in the dressing room , he trains hard , he &apos;s good in form , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged .
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he secures the man from Canberra as a long @-@ term permanent part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we want the team to be completely focused on competition and not on all the controversies round &#91; Kyrgios &#93; , &quot; Healy said .
and I think Nick has made the rise very quickly , as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out , rising in the eyes of the public , and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we are trying to support him , we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , withdraws refugees
Hungary explains the state of emergency and called off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , holding all those trying to enter the country illegally , all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no @-@ man &apos;s land and Serbian officials responded with outrage .
the people who fled violence were stranded for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustrations rose .
as a police helicopter hovered over them , the migrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and cried insults against Hungarian riot police .
some rejected food and water in protest .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; for migrants to be sent back from Hungary while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not collateral damage .
talks must take place with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; Ivica Dacic said in Prague .
the turmoil on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc failed to agree a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels .
however , Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overcrowded Italy and Greece , and expressed their hope that an agreement would eventually be reached - next month or by the end of the year - that EU countries would accept another 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special European Union summit to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on early action by Brussels or its neighbours .
the state of emergency launched on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto , meanwhile , said his country was also planning to build a barbed wire mine along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border .
CBS News correspondent Charlie D &apos;Agata reported that even prison inmates were deployed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and a point of entry into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Orban , however , has insisted that most of the arrivals are economic refugees looking for a better life , rather than war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly at odds with other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or damage to the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 @-@ foot ) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia , a crime that also imposes higher prison sentences on convicted traffickers .
&quot; because of the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
Parliament has yet to agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected for next week , but reporters from Associated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gyorgy Bakondi , land security adviser for Orban , said authorities had 45 people in trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country .
they come up by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws .
authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and pressed a crowd to push back there .
about 20 succeeded , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway link from Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Bernie Sanders in national poll halved
former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at national level , but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining her ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries ( 58 percent earlier ) , while Sanders is second , with 27 percent ( rising 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries .
more than five months before the start of the primaries , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
since the CBS News poll , Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups , while Sanders has made some gains .
Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates , but those presenters have diminished .
their support for men has fallen significantly , and Sanders is only 5 points behind here .
Clinton &apos;s advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated , and she and Sanders are now on equal footing .
Clinton , however , still has a big lead among older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double @-@ digit lead at the Liberals , but Sanders now has a 5 @-@ point lead at that group .
about half of the Democratic voters of the primaries nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six per cent would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are mostly thrilled by her .
the views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - just about a quarter would enthusiastically support her .
while 48 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republican voters say this over their top candidate Donald Trump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval for dealing with the problems and selectivity is also cited .
as the vice president casts a potential for the presidential primary , 57 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not .
when Democratic voters are asked about who would be their second choice for the party , Biden is at the helm .
of Clinton &apos;s supporters , more than half say Biden would be her second choice far ahead of Sanders .
if Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead increases before Sanders , from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; but that figure has fallen by 78 percent last month .
Biden is by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; most electable &quot; has risen .
still , when asked about what is more important to a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about electability .
like last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for those voters of the primaries stands as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results on some important features in their party &apos;s primaries .
majorities view Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Biden cuts best among the three candidates at honesty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of Democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say that about Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him on that .
democratic voters of the primaries generally also see Clinton , Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders .
as questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server continue to be asked during the term as Secretary of State , most Democratic voters of the primaries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say it has not affected their opinions overall .
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public as a whole .
half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement , while only about a third are satisfied .
public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said their opinion of her had deteriorated .
it &apos;s mainly Republicans , more than six out of 10 , who say their views have gotten worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is seen by her party &apos;s voters as honest and trustworthy , this remains a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
sixty @-@ six percent of voters do not think they are an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voters nationwide see Trump as not honest and untrustworthy .
Clinton and Trump , however , get good marks on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Biden , Carson and Bush perform best in honesty .
a majority see Sanders as more than honest , but as with Carson , many have no opinion of him .
the margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Carson moves close to Donald Trump in nationwide poll
Ben Carson is close to Donald Trump &apos;s latest poll by CBS News / New York Times
the two candidates now account for half of voters &apos; support in the new poll , and others are losing dramatically
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide , with support growing from 23 % in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month , up 27 % in Tuesday &apos;s poll .
but Carson shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the poll also showed that Carson is doing well among demographic groups and that Trump is outperforming higher education among Republican voters .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich , has been cut off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker , who has fallen the deepest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida governor Jeb Bush , former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are ranked third with 6 % .
the margin of error in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is Plus or Minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CNN / ORC poll released last week shows Carson rising in the polls - he landed at 19 % support among Republicans , behind which Trump was 32 % support .
ABC News / Washington Post &apos;s latest poll also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson .
looking ahead to a Carson rise last week , Trump found some sidelines for the former neurosurgeon , even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if peak levels are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vacationers to find warm water .
a bath in North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some no longer go to the sea : no more than 18 degrees water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DWD ) informs .
bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east , it even rises to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College newcomer
nearly two years after a student died during a bullying ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges are filed against five people .
members of the New York @-@ based Baruch College Pi @-@ Delta Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun &quot; Michael &quot; Deng during a introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , police said .
officials said he was saddled with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound backpack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to get over a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Deng eventually complained about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
members of the Pi @-@ Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to hospital , according to police .
however , they had the time to switch Dengs clothing , to goose his symptoms and Andy Meng , the Brotherhood &apos;s national president , to contact counsel , police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference .
&quot; at this point , members began to hide utensils and basically put the good of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng , &quot; police chief Wagner said .
he could not be revived and he died the next morning of his injuries .
according to an autopsy report , Deng was repeatedly inflicted with blunt force injuries to head , hull and thigh .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood ... at least one student has been dying of the bullying every year since 1970 , &quot; Douglas Fierberg , a lawyer representing Dengs &apos;s family , said in a statement .
Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable , and this move by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge of murder of third @-@ degree murder for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Meng , are also charged with bullying and forming a criminal association .
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or unofficial - has sanctioned this , so we will also hold them accountable , &quot; Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday .
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation with the local group .
that will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
an increase in interest rates comes , and home prices are set to falter , yields on bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , history provides little guidance for the economy .
a recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial assets react .
as a result , US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normalization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants may find that the whole excitement of an increase in interest rates has perhaps been exaggerated .
&quot; the first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; Julian Jessop , chief economist at Capital Economics , said in a note to clients .
by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal highs , but still to low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear .
however , that does not mean there will be no impact .
here &apos;s a historical trend @-@ based look at how some areas of the economy might respond :
as the market saw last month , anticipating interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while .
once the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there appears to be a tendency for asset yields to be strangled 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after interest rate increases in the Fed .
more specifically , in the past 35 years , the market has mostly been in the upward trend - about 14 per cent - on the road to interest rate increases , pretty flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 per cent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return on the past six cycles of 14.4 per cent , according to a recent analysis firm .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increases cycle and that returns start to decrease .
recessions are a fact of economic life , but rates often encourage them .
in the current case , the Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the Fed &apos;s interest rate hike .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta Fed .
interest rate increases at such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; Deutsche Bank said .
market participants have taken the whole year on an interest rate hike from the Fed , and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week , which ends Thursday .
while many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in that session , futures trading only gives up a 25 percent probability .
&quot; in our study , all the increases have taken place from 1950 to today in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ recession levels have been coming into the shadows very quickly after the start of the recovery , &quot; the report said .
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period .
the current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is pretty similar to that in the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on equities when those change their strategic rate .
for bonds , returns appear to change direction once the first increase / reduction is made in the cycle .
at the end of the increases cycle , bond yields fall immediately , Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Schwab &apos;s strategists believe the rise in interest rates will lead to returns between longer and shorter bonds , leading to a slump in the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better returns in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cautious about expecting higher yields , &quot; Kathy Jones , Fixed @-@ Income analyst at Schwab , said in an analysis .
what is interesting is that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tougher monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit packets have expanded and volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy .
by and large , companies that handle the larger portion of their business in the US will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market , as well as financing their debts .
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to respond exceedingly positively three months after an initial rate increase , &quot; Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers .
companies with a strong balance sheet have surpassed an average of 5 percentage points on average after each of the rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counterparts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , Goldman said .
outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see gains through higher yields , even if experts disagree on how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MPs Andrew Bingham
the Conservative member of parliament criticized the broadcaster for its &apos; dumby&apos;
he argues that he is increasingly not different from commercial rivals .
he also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they only imitated The Brits
Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading parliamentary member and increasing new pressure on the broadcaster to prove he is doing something private broadcasters don &apos;t do .
conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public @-@ sector radio station was &quot; disillusioned &quot; and increasingly no longer distinct from its commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dumbfounded &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also targeted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , appear to be The Brits only under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you are actually just mimicking what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr Bingham .
BBC director @-@ general dismissed the allegations , arguing that BBC Radio 3 is well ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educating the public .
what I get from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music that &apos;s really unmatched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to finding new music and commissioned new works , I also think really important , &quot; he said .
earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that harder work had to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because Britons are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Choice of Culture , Media and Sport to step down commercial rivals .
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced &quot; in a special BBC way . &quot;
he added that he wanted the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stall &quot; when it launched an entertainment series next time .
however , he refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money on fee payers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there was seven per cent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since records began in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
experts believe Black Friday slowed spending in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has boomed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities .
but experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven per cent in the first three months of 2015 .
total spending for August represented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , with only five per cent increase over the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed just seven per cent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always evolved over time , &quot; Andy Mulcahy , editor of the IMRG sales index told the Guardian .
he explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
but now this is commonplace , and we may see growth diminishing .
the black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the waning turnovers .
experts believe buyers will withhold their purchases before this event , which takes place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers screamed around their computers to make their bargains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe Black Friday , at which buyers battled for bargains , could stop buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Consortium found that of £ 5 spent slightly more than £ 1 online .
for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than a third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mecca killed in Kran accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanctioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca by the streets
Saudi Arabia posts collapse in part of huge Saudish Bin Laden group
the Department of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the ones killed when a crane crashed at Mekka &apos;s grandmosque .
grieving filled , largely dressed in white , the track to pay tribute to her when the first of the dead entered her final trip to the Al @-@ Moaissem cemetery .
the funeral procession moved to the Holy Site , where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the begging .
the bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction over the Bin Laden family &apos;s construction company because of the disaster , which also left 394 injured .
the bodies of 29 officers killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mekkas were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton , Greater Manchester , the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell down .
MR Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Haddsch at the Great Mosque .
Saudi officials have already determined that the Haddsch will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today , King Salman said the Bin Laden group should not have steered the arm of the wreath when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree , published by the state @-@ run Saudi Press Agency , said the Bin Laden group was complicit in the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report that detail , but said the company &apos;s leadership was banned from travelling abroad .
earlier this week , Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the sick , who crashed into an inner courtyard of the Grand Mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddsch , which takes place later this month .
the Bin @-@ Laden group has issued no statements about the collapse de Krans , and its representatives were not available for comment .
the Royal Decree also tadled the group for non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mekka &apos;s big mosque as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin @-@ Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been linked to Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and is taking on major construction projects .
the late leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a breakaway son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the wreath &apos;s crash came amid heavy winds and rain , just days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim .
officials said 158 people remain in hospital .
officials ordered that 1 million Rial ( £ 174,000 ) be paid to the relatives of those killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other casualties receive half of that amount .
B &amp; Q boss says time is ahead of cheap Eastern European craftsmen
Britons increasingly employ craftsmen , says Veronique Laury
the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has surged
this leads to the opening of 200 other Screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen
at the same time , Kingfisher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide
by Rupert Steiner , City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Britons lay down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen doing the work in their home
if you can send a hammer or brush to remove walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays .
because Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to perform home @-@ grown jobs in their homes , according to the head of the company behind B &amp; Q.
Véronique Laury , new managing director of Kingfisher , which owns the construction market chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now outdated .
as a result , Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and closing 60 outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Laury said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of 10 purchase decisions in the store are made by women .
at the moment , the men outweigh the staff .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past .
Mrs Laury said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move this towards a balance .
in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Laury , who is one of only five women at the top of a leading company listed in the FTSE100 index , has also revamped her top team to reflect a similar number of men and women in leadership positions .
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and finance arm .
Mrs Laury said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
Kingfisher reported a drop in half @-@ year profits and sales after the group owed the cost of closing stores .
because of the trend Kingfisher , who owns Screwfix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
officials of Aich / Dob due to infidelity in court
on Wednesday , at Klagenfurt , two officials of the Austrian volleyball star Aich / Dob have to answer for infidelity and abortion .
the defendants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse of office .
he was legally acquitted of this charge in May .
the current process has been postponed .
according to District Attorney Robert Riffel , in the preliminary investigation , it emerged that the defendants used funds from club accounts over which they were allowed to dispense in their functions for private purposes in 2006 @-@ 2011 .
he cites the damage with around 400,000 euros .
sports officials are also charged with financial offences .
this was the fact that the chairman of the Schopenensenate , Judge Michaela Sanin , was leaving .
it is to be negotiated at a later stage .
to dismiss the infidelity , the defense stated that at no time had an asset been created .
sports officials would only have billed expenses and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 , in which they had invested a lot of time and money , had run out of debt - the Passiva was about 600,000 chilling ( $ 444,000 ) in 2001 .
&quot; at the time we were facing the situation : do we continue to run the club or block us ? &quot; one of the defendants , in the brothel profession of large @-@ scale financial investigators .
he then decided with his colleague and co @-@ defendant to take on this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have imposed money , executed our life insurance as a security at the bank , &quot; he said at the arrest .
with the club agreed : they can manage the money freely , only no debt must be made .
furthermore , in the event of financial success , the disbursement of expenses was decided retroactively until 1991 .
as a result , some of the expenses paid off only years later , from 2003 , when a plus was in the account .
as a result , flat @-@ rate and non @-@ detailed bookings appeared , the former Obmann explained the transactions .
the accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together , the second defendant said .
why the withdrawals had not been disclosed to the club in detail , the judge asked .
the club didn &apos;t care in detail about financial management , important was just debt free , according to the answer .
when an official began an investigation into abuse of power in 2011 , a sum of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account .
those were reserves , the defendants said .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the club , according to his statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; the judge wanted to know .
the respondents did not know a response .
he then finally thought that this was the best thing for the club .
if anything had happened to him , no one would have known anything about that money , the prosecutor put in the room .
the co @-@ defendant was informed , the official justified himself .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; compensation for damages . &quot;
why claims ? , judge and prosecutor wanted to know .
on that , the first defendant said he did not agree with that phrase because the club had never suffered any damage .
but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; With that , you &apos;re all out of the tailor . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the official said he never received a cent salary , saying he only billed mileage and diets .
on diets , he charged the club £ 1,000 a month , but the actual expense was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not be provided by the defendants .
they were not kept after an operating audit in which everything had been judged correct , they said .
mileage was also related to the second defendant .
all the closures were made in cash , to which he had to go from his place of residence to the bank to Bleiburg , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard cuts another 30,000 jobs
in addition to three years of staff reductions , the computer giant will reduce further jobs when the company is split .
the pitfalls at the US computer giant Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer business .
this is expected to save costs of $ 2.7 billion ( $ 2.4 billion ) , the company said Tuesday .
the move will result in a special charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter .
the three @-@ year reduction of 55,000 jobs has not yet been completed .
HP still employed some 302,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 .
afterward , the Hewlett @-@ Packard stock added 2.3 percent .
the group , which is large with printers from the California Palo Alto , is currently splitting up : this year &apos;s computer and printer business will be bundled into a new company , separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both branches are expected to be listed on the stock exchange .
another disappointing PC sales , as well as weaker demand from corporate customers for its services , were the second @-@ largest PC manufacturer in the world after Lenovo .
in the third quarter ended July , sales of PC and printers fell 11.5 percent .
sales fell 8 percent to just $ 25.4 billion .
as a result , the proceeds declined in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a split and massive job cuts to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has reacted late in the day that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets rather than traditional computers and are increasingly doing business online .
Whitman &apos;s restructuring plans provide a total of around 55,000 jobs .
conflict : majority backs anti @-@ IS training mission
however , direct participation of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would largely come against : 54 % opposed it , and 35 % were in favour .
that other states fly air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
24 percent oppose intervening in the conflict .
working with Syrian leader Bashar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those surveyed oppose it , while 20 percent would be in favour .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day on the 66th IAA
the exhibition focuses on interconnected , self @-@ driving cars and electric mobility until September 27 .
after two press days , Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the slogan &quot; Mobility links &quot; on Thursday .
the broad audience can visit the IAA from Saturday .
the organisers of the car association VDA expect about 900 000 visitors as of two years ago .
Röszke : violence on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used tear gas and water cannons against several hundred refugees on the Serbian border .
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind that , a police line had formed and behind the police there was a water cannon ready .
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles , according to officials .
officials initially set up uninterrupted pepper spray .
after that , police used tear gas .
much tear gas has been sputtered toward the refugees .
this dissolved the group .
the refugees have now withdrawn somewhat .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried out of the zone .
children who had inhaled tear gas shouted .
other refugees sacked in and suffered from breathing .
the Serbian police press secretary also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
the world is watching when the US Federal Reserve meets on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
a survey among 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half who thought last week that the Fed would do so now thinks the Fed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 per cent .
it &apos;s a historic event because it &apos;s been seven years since the Fed put interest rates on NULL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may be leaving the zero area and launching a process of normalising interest rates , &quot; said Angel Ubide , chief executive at the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is at a relatively good level of performance , trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global conditions .
it has warned markets to adjust to an increase , but signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good .
the decision is due to be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday
death guard at Delta State University left apology letter
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could do it unscathed , &quot; authorities announced Tuesday .
police in Gautier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said he shot at someone and killed someone .
Lamb told the emergency department &apos;s staff that police had to send police to his home .
he said , &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; was in the house but that &quot; no one will disturb &quot; but will probably be excited .
police asked the caller about his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Prentiss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted to , I could undo it .
I loved Amy , and she &apos;s the only woman ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed Ethan Schmidt , a professor of history , before eventually taking his own life on Monday evening when police raided him .
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr. Lambs &apos;s imagination . &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said Tuesday there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangular relationship . &quot;
Prentiss was described by Shawn O &apos;Steen , who said they were married about seven years ago , as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends .
O &apos;Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot;
he said Prentiss was her daughter &apos;s &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Prentiss worked online from home , according to Linsday Knowles , who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss .
Knowles said that Prentiss , who owned a dog called Lightning , had met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Knowles said
police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time Monday to tell them &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot;
when police officers picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctoral degree from Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , according to his lifeline on the university &apos;s website .
stars who lost their fortune
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Redmond ( right ) , had some stressful years .
he fought leukemia in 2001 , and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner , Farrah Fawcett , because of cancer .
the actor also allegedly struggled with drugs , and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession .
all this certainly takes its toll .
Eurowings : Lufthansa builds the group
Lufthansa plans to build a large group .
half a billion euros a year , the Lufthansa Group alone wants to save with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1,000 executives will cost the group reconstruction the job .
however , the pilot union has new negotiations .
Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and upgrading low @-@ cost Eurowings .
the aim of the realignment is a result contribution of around € 500 million a year from cost and redemption strategies , the airline said Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be responsible for the passenger business .
Eurowings budget airline should be developed as independently as possible .
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the board of Chief Carsten Spohr .
with the new edition , Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings , which the Group intends to oppose Ryanair and Easyjet in the future .
so far , the organisation of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines rallied under the roof of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three @-@ quarters of annual sales of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with pilots
in the collective bargaining agreement with the Cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are expected to resume following the court @-@ ordered strike this Thursday .
that told the union .
the issue of the talks is to be the retirement scheme for pilots .
Cockpit wanted to achieve sustainable results &quot; in one year with a projected record result . &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
in addition to the transitional supply of pilots , background is the &quot; Wings &quot; saving concept .
it provides that , in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is outsourcing routes to Eurowings &apos; own low @-@ cost line .
under the title &quot; Dawn to the South , &quot; paintings by Leena Krüger can be seen in the artist &apos;s house .

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven .
while this has brought left fielder to the wines and will exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Shaw broke into the PSV area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
van Gaal said : &quot; he has a double leg fracture and is in hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
he had an oxygen mask in the dressing room .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fracture , that will take six months and he won &apos;t play in the group stage .
I hope he can play again this season .
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of an elephant .
Nicola Rizzoli , the referee , has not punished Mexicans .
van Gaal suspected the Italian referee had been wrong .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a tweet on Shaw &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your news ... words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I &apos;m coming back stronger . &quot;
related : Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
the England defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover by next June .
Phillip Cocu , the PSV coach , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he &apos;s doing very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent and if you then hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; Cocu said .
for me , it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball going in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched &#91; Moreno &#93; him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
speaking with SBS6 , Moreno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard something like this can be .
I feel very bad about it , so sorry .
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital - after a foul play by Chris Smalling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better ?
it &apos;s one thing all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you almost know it .
unless you may be David Cameron .
when asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children &apos;s book , the prime minister opted for The Lorax , the 1971 environmental fence of Dr Seuss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the company &apos;s website SuperCamps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read out to my children , because there always seems to be a picture or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
all fine and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron reportedly describes the book &apos;s action , instead reproduces a summary of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the surrounding town of Thneed @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey , the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree , &quot; one reads : a love interest was Dr. Seuss , whose verlance was unknown .
as if this was not yet suspicious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads in part as the summary of the Lorax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the revamped city of Thneed @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy hopes to win a boy named Ted , hopes .
although he admits to being a pragmatic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron will be familiar with the book &apos;s action so little .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child .
a Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely to come from Cameron &apos;s constituency office .
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Lyth was clearly under threat from exclusion from England team , but it &apos;s still hard
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you look at the caddie that England selected for the Tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series defeat is not on my map .
I wouldn &apos;t rule out an upside victory .
Alastair Cooks &apos; side may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batting draw , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear scars of 2012 , just a juicy @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball developing Moeen Ali as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid , even if he represents an unknown size on Test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Lyth leaves the England Test caddie and is replaced by Alex Hales .
the decision to leave Adam Lyth is , of course , hard for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyze .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks in difficult conditions , and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe Root , for example , and that led to the nomination , since - and I said so earlier - players are their own best selectors .
long ago , one would have extended the course of Lyth , but he had control of his own destiny .
if he hopefully picks up more runs for Yorkshire , another chance comes .
the England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t deliver such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he &apos;s primarily a team man .
the question of how much time a Test batter receives to set his mark is difficult .
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine .
only Compton got the chance to play home and out .
the only accusation you can raise was that England first put Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in maximum form - but that lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hales comes in and he &apos;s a drummer I appreciate highly .
he &apos;s an X @-@ factor cricket player what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge spot , which hit us very much .
he has to get at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this obviously depends on the managerial performance in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of beating Moeen alongside Cook , which would provide an extra @-@ spin bowler and get four Quicks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a batter can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ hander has already shown he is a felony of cricket players .
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire , but is he a number 3 for them , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at the first drop before joining as an opener in 2001 .
he made three hundred Runs immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
Zafar Ansari arrives in the caddie as a back @-@ up spinner , and in my limited dealings with him he very impressed me as a young man .
people may look at his statistics - an average of 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a punt , but there &apos;s no big number of backup spinning players who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England have made a few clever additions at the coaching staff .
the appointment of Mahela Jayawardene , the batsman from Sri Lanka , as an adviser to the Test matches could be a championship coup .
he is one of the most nice guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood arrives for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful bet into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cricket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh winds in the dressing room , even if the news is in line with what has been said earlier .
Collys teammate at Durham , Ben Stokes , will not be deployed at the One @-@ Dayers , Root received a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but Coaches and team creators do not determine the timetable .
and you have to remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Brexit camp ( Brexit = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain in Zulauf if the economy gets into a rot by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s outspoken renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Corbyn to leader of Labour or the TUC , who clashed heavily because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages .
a European diplomat &apos;s friend recently said that some member states , as deeply embroiled in various crises as the EU is now , and not always on their own fault , are fed up with Britain &apos;s self @-@ prepared agenda with divided concessions and disruptive treaty changes they mostly don &apos;t want .
in Brighton , the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it also does not like it if it endangers social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers are climbing at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , taking a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then coming home and saying they are winning allies for reform .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wants an outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Lass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cautious chancellor , Angela Merkel , is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , as has happened with the overly long @-@ running like Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks to his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a fading force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right @-@ wing government , Spain a leftist .
it is difficult to imagine that they will be sufficient to help the selfie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most of the similar separatist tendencies have .
so some such ministers may even deliberately plan unhelpful remarks , quite SNP @-@ style , during Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process , my friend suspects .
&quot; the renegotiation was a default &quot; and &quot; Britain has not won anything of value from renegotiation . &quot;
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at its expense and which EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press barons , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can feel weak about Boris Johnson , the ore euro opportunists who made a name as an &quot; EU straight banana &quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 90 &apos;s .
in all his ruthlessness , Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were .
this included the Medley of tax @-@ prone villains , phone hacker foreigners and the pseudo non @-@ indigenous who own most of our major newspapers .
in fact , Tony Blair thought similar about her , but noted that when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage , you better distribute bananas to distract him rather than become at his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum swirl , because Blair had put the principle on the unapproved EU constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back door to him .
the press has never sidelined him .
but the nice Jeremy Corbyn , who gave me a friendly claps on his back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer needed time for me to waste - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock &apos;s boycott Murdoch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake at the time and today .
it may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Marr , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Corbyn &apos;s official position on Europe is - I am very friendly - in development .
he says we should remain in a reformed EU .
well , most people outside Ukips traditional Broad @-@ arbutant tendency and the wild filming of Torys Klein @-@ Engnationism can well say yes .
it &apos;s what Hilary said &quot; A Benn , but no Bennite &quot; Benn on radio and television this week said when the scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn &apos;s appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be illoyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hilary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but struggling to stay &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benns &apos;s expression - was not what McDonnell said , nor what JC told his comrades and MPs after all the reports at their small @-@ scale meeting on Monday night .
whatever Corbyn &apos;s touching bottom @-@ up image wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the Strudel of Social Media , a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal .
it is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe , which allows him to consider Labours support in the referendum campaign a matter of course , as McDonnell said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so .
but McDonnell and Corbyn &apos;s fundamental ambiguity about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left @-@ wing dissidents , for whom the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes .
as with his ambiguities to Nato - Tom Watson is rocky convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be required to try to find in everything a sense of their superiors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless ?
the US is already rather disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power , which I was reminded at the launch on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum .
experts criticize report by Public Health England on e @-@ cigarettes
claims by a government @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , in part with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts writing in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England ( phe ) in its report on e @-@ cigarettes .
phe published the &quot; principle report &quot; last month , describing it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily windy basis &quot; on which phe justified its main conclusion .
two other researchers write in BMJ and asked if the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin McKee , professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell , professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public expects that phe &apos;s assertion that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision @-@ making analysis ( Multi @-@ Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA ) to lead their opinions on the damage from various nicotine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report .
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health , whose managing director had previously received funds from British American Tobacco ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also signed BAT &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but did not add to the funding he was supposed to receive , according to reports earlier by tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting members of the panel are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarette champions , some of whom also specify industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also included the tobacco management of phe .
the group &apos;s research work &quot; admits tellingly &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of the damage to most products on most criteria , &quot; McKee and Capewell wrote .
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the phe report .
McKee and Capewell said that phe &apos;s claims that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes were &quot; premature as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
prof Kevin Fenton , director of health and well @-@ being at phe , said that response to BMJ &apos;s claims had already been made .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life smoker dies from his addiction .
all the evidence suggests that e @-@ cigarettes &apos; health risks are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term impact .
phe has a clear duty to inform the public about what is evidence and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System £ 2bn a year .
by clearly presenting current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking are our national competence .
BBC should abandon EastEnders , says former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice , saying that commercial rivals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap .
Johnson said the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs not sent through other UK channels .
he criticized the BBC for placing public @-@ sector programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ fought time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and by broadcasters like BBC4 .
after the BBC &apos;s director @-@ general , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which would also clearly be shown by unsubsidized rivals , &quot; Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least place your production on programmes that others do not make or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window because they want to achieve as much support as possible for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous , it &apos;s nonsense , of course .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a regressive tax is funding programs that could also be funded without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , EastEnders is another , admittedly both own productions .
frankly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think that would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that directed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was guilty of hunting for ratings &quot; because of the ambitions of the people working there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broadcasts reflect what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his MacTaggart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ sector niche programs &quot; should go to BBC4 , where you can &apos;t measure pretty much the audience , but they perform their duties , and they can argue that if they go on their apparent holy missions to justify £ 4 billion broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obscure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window of opportunity where no one ever wanted to see them .
on the radio charge , Johnson told the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of terms of who can get the best value out of it .
of course , you all think we all think you get a big value here for £ 150 a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
former Sky- and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to &quot; inform , train and entertain . &quot;
he said little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1 per cent of its TV production and 0.1 per cent on radio - and it should take an example to public television stations in Australia and Canada to &quot; inform , clarify and entertain this . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships , Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as that of the Proms , of which he said only a handful are shown on television , and with the commercial broadcasters taking alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;Sonogenetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the Nematodes change the direction at the moment they are aired with sound waves .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves .
the tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment they are aired with sound waves that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
the impulses work by switching motoneuron cells genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
further on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure , called Sonogenetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep @-@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulse into people &apos;s brain to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
Fadenworms usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chalasani noted that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , amplify ultrasound waves that then penetrate the worms .
the reinforced ultrasonic waves affect structures called TRP @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes by some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , according to a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nematodes , Chalasani genetically changed worms so some of its motoneurons carry TRP @-@ 4 ion channels .
when it applies ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the microwaves and transferred to the worms where they switch the modified motoneurons .
the procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics , a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons into and out with impulses of light .
but Chalasani said Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light , which has to be lowered to the desired spot in the brain at an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasonic tissues can pass freely and thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; Chalasani said .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .
illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep !
the ads embarrass Britain &apos;s arms trade
Amnesty International Anti @-@ Weapons airs video .
terrible killer drones !
foot gelenk shattered leg boots !
cluster bombs !
and electric shock rods that cause agonising pain but leave no trace !
the cheerful voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world &apos;s largest weapons fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to bring the British government &apos;s willingness to ramp up arms to repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at ExCedons Centre .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : drive from 15 to 18 September with the DLR ? &quot; ( Docklands Light Railway ) you read in the font types of the London Underground and the hallmark of the DLR line , which turns to the image of a tank .
in September , a swarm of gun dealers with DLR will drive ... customers will be asked to help stop the gun fair .
the 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland .
a collective named Special Patrol Group helped distribute it in London and used &quot; Ad Space Hack Packs , &quot; a £ 6 pack of bus keys claiming that &quot; access to around a third of bus stop advertising space on the planet . &quot;
transport for London does not find this poster &quot; vandalism &quot; funny .
one of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group .
according to Gavin Grindon , curator of Crueol designs and lecturer at the University of Essex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries .
many artists are working with activists within protest movements , noting that they need to go outside to the real world so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ gun drug posters greets commuters in the subway .
the Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP , which works nonprofit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist , who also works for free .
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the gun trade - through a leaf of the ExCeL calendar - and thought , &quot; Do we give them the campaign they are trying to avoid . &quot;
they played with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertising , but &quot; by engaging with bright colors and animation it remains more liable . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; Tom Davies of Amnesty says .
what we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded illegally on our doorstep .
perhaps the most creative art around the Arms Fair comes from the area within ExCeL , where exhibitors froze fantastically euphemistic products .

eight golden rules for life in student homes
eleven years ago I moved to a student &apos;s home as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism , but only now I remember the tense smile of those I annoyed - and to the numerous , long @-@ suffering complaints about others .
most of what I &apos;ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules .
the entry into student homes ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely terrifying .
it &apos;s tempting to snap : people tell where you get , whether and where you &apos;ve taken Sabbath year , where you &apos;re in terms of Corbyn and why you &apos;re &quot; frankly Marmite neither love nor hate it because in earnest , guys , it &apos;s just a heap extract haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others do the same - put questions and show interest .
it directs the conversation and helps you find out the people you like , unlike those you wouldn &apos;t talk to , even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers .
let people .
people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into drinks receptions , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people are moving and putting their underwear on .
related : don &apos;t remember to start at the university with a relationship
introverted receive rough treatment at university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student homes form a space @-@ to @-@ space bump culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship .
that can be the hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so I get the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a commilitone of conviviality is exhausted - and send it a text message instead of knocking .
speaking of knock : do it .
a guy in my student &apos;s homes had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
as you start the university at the height of the back mania , the clutching of people &apos;s doors to imagine a plate full of brownies is less strange than the greeting of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have some baked ... so , and now please smile , if I ask you a personal question . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friendships .
your fellow residents feel obliged to entertain themselves and may end up associating your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent baker .
badly missed clumps of flour , sugar and fat lead people to sleep when you knock .
stealing food is a common crime in student homes .
of course , clawing chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea , too ?
check this with the dairy owner .
the chances are good that they say they serve themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone steals your stuff , that &apos;s annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to do it more evenly than my fellow Members , who added a dishwasher to their milk to punish thieves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that prevents people from sleeping or from working .
it &apos;s not just a matter of being a decent person , but that in the true sense of the saying , you &apos;re among the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my hallway asked her neighbors if it makes them something to put Drum &amp; Bass a little quieter , because it was three in the morning and she had an exam in the morning .
they responded with even louder music .
when they finally stopped at 5 a.m. , they kindly left their neighbours to sleep two hours before plunging their own music , closed their door and went to their three @-@ hour exam .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to be entering the same student home ?
conversely , would it not be baseless for you to hold a co @-@ worker for your future spouse , to run to them , to separate themselves again and then to see them every day , and perhaps to see how they are going to overtake all the common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot co @-@ worker is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to talk to your underbelly a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left their keys in his unlocked room , the boundary between an ulk and bullying is finer than it seems .
a good stint is funny , but it takes only moments to become boomerang .
give by hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about security - but never forget someone &apos;s room with toothpaste and shampoo .
close her door , and put her keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but tackle her possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terraced houses for refugees , single parents , low earners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses for people who do not have much money .
so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only do refugees need housing , but also the single mother and the low @-@ earner . &quot;
&quot; I show how you can still build cheap and good today , &quot; the 44 @-@ year @-@ old says in the interview
thousands of refugees will push into the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes in knowing how quickly to create affordable housing : he is building up terraced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr Gildner , many refugees will push into the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gildner : mass accommodation in containers or turkeys has no sustainability .
because people remain to a large extent here .
given the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient housing over the next few decades .
a very banal , three @-@ storey terraced house is the solution .
Gildner : a terraced house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
that &apos;s different from subjecting people into residential blocks .
each of the six houses that are being built in the pilot project consists of three units of residence for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a living room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
how much are the costs ?
Gildner : the price of 160 square feet of living space per house is 184 000 euros , without a plot .
that is manageable .
six months has passed construction .
that is appropriate .
have construction rules complicated their plans ?
Gildner : I got my project correctly .
in particular , it always makes the looming Damocesque value special construction and the pitch regulation .
grinning .
it is still understated who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three pitches .
only in cities there is no place for this .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did residents respond to their terraced project ?
Gildner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not true .
but don &apos;t you exacerbate competition for affordable housing ?
Gildner : true , we &apos;ve had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but built luxury apartments that can barely afford one more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low @-@ earner .
I show how we can still build cheap and good today .
that is what we are talking about .

Ios 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the hiring app , typing on &quot; General &quot; and then &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message that tells you that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to bypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update through iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made this more unlikely by streamlining the update , and it will be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete .
it &apos;s worth making sure your mobile phone is uploaded during the upgrade or is near a charger so the battery is loaded .
if the charge is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may be shut down halfway and this could lead to a crash of the update .

bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
founded three months ago , Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen has added another member to its ranks , increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann , a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen .
Gauselmann is a member of the Bundesverwaltskreuz 1st Class and honorary citizen of Espelkamp and Lübbecke .
the chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that echoed chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to include chess players who cannot raise the membership fee .
youth employment and talent search should also be promoted .
Gauselmann wants to see membership in the chess club as well as friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of his attachment to the spa town .
QuartiersOffice seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Antonistift Altencenter have joined forces under the mantle of the Social Foundation and opened a new one @-@ stop shop at Graf @-@ Stauffenberg Square .
in addition to discussions , courses can also be held there .
the social foundation draws it from the mountain to the city centre .
more specifically , at Graf @-@ Stauffenberg Square .
a new Quartiere office was recently opened there .
here , right next to the shopping market , seniors and councillors will now receive information on issues such as health care insurance or health care benefits .
for years we have found with our outpatient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are a great many questions .
&quot; also , not often many of the benefits of the coffers are not used because the complexity of insurance is barely understood , &quot; explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand , who is also responsible for the Antonist and Civic Hospital as well as for the ambulance service &quot; Amadeus . &quot;
in addition to the discussions , the new QuartiersBureau also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
the Saludis has been taken to this end .
therefore additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or physiotherapy can be used .
the offers of the senior centre and the Saludis are ideal .
Saludis stands for prevention , preparedness and rehab .
&quot; the senior management center for care and care , &quot; Heike Riedel , managing director of Saludis said .
the reason for the opening of the new QuartiersOffice in the city centre is that both business leaders look particularly at demographic change .
because this makes a good decentralised infrastructure essential in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future .
in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metzner ( SPD ) underlined at the inauguration ceremony , the QuartiersBureau also dedicated itself to the association at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite you to a regular societal presence . &quot;
the social foundation thus makes a big contribution that seniors can live as independently as possible and well in their familiar environment .
the QuartiersBureau is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.

Vienna architect Karl Mang 92 @-@ year @-@ old deceased
Karl Mang , one of the doyens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died as early as September 5 at the age of 92 , according to the artist &apos;s house on Tuesday .
with Mang , the artist &apos;s house loses an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as stated in the broadcast .
born in Vienna in 1922 , Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna near Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II .
he worked as a freelance architect since 1952 , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager .

parking sentence : Tim Wiese accuses policeman with money
ex @-@ footballer Tim Wiese has been unaccounted for in Bremen .
footballer was once , meanwhile , Tim Wiese , ex @-@ national director in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim is engaged , Wrestler .
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have added in the past two years , according to his own statement .
intellectually , he did not admit it .
Wiese just cut the hair in Bremer downtown when he saw how outside a parking room guard turned out a criminal record for his white Chevrolet Camaro .
Wiese then stormed out of business , offended the official and threw her the due fine before her feet , according to the &quot; Picture &quot; newspaper .
in the city of Bremen , the allegations are confirmed , but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear .
&quot; the thing is still in check , &quot; it said of the city of Bremen .
only then will you decide whether Wiese will be displayed , or not .
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants

men spray on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghans
witnesses are searching police for an incident in Bad Soden Salmünster : on Friday night , at 11.45pm , three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , followed his two friends at a distance of about five metres , according to police , and called on them to wait for him .
at that time , the group was at the height of the bft petrol station .
there were also three people on the site of the petrol station .
one of these men now shouted to the youngsters and hit them with the fist .
the victim suffered a loss of nose and blew heavily out of his nose .
when his two friends rushed and appealed to the racket , his victim initially left .
of his friends , the injured young man has now been brought home .
the perpetrator pursued the group with a car to its home and passed through demonstratively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
he was attacked again by the racket and another male .
in addition to a stroke , one checked on the victim &apos;s face and thigh .
the injured had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
so far , there is only a vague description of the matter .
one of the men was about 1.80 feet tall .
the second racket was said to have been about 1.65 feet tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
police are asking witnesses and shipowners to contact 06181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and invests £ 310,000
Silvia Müller @-@ Gongoll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ursel Felsteausen .
in addition to this , you will also be able to benefit from the Master of Music , Bernd Bormann , the Business Promotion in Uta Seim @-@ Schwartz and Asendorf Mayor Heinfried Kabbert .
in many places in the country , doctors are missing - Asendorf , on the other hand , is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes on the practice of field breaks on 1 October .
while Ursel Felsteausen is retiring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing by half a spot in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Muller reopens the practice on October 12 , until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the rock performers met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gongoll years ago , who is currently completing their studies at the Verne Hospital and is also planning to enter into practice next year .
&quot; we always had in mind that the garbage users would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ursel Felsteausen and laughs .
&quot; when it was , I just called them . &quot;
to the Ehepaar Müller , the idea of pursuing its own practice in Asendorf in the future .
&quot; proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also looks to be his own boss soon .
and so one agreed , the garbage makers bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruchhausen @-@ Vilsen .
the two @-@ time family friend Frank Müller also grew up there , and his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several physicians &apos; offices and hospitals in Sulingen , Nienburg and Rotenburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sulingen , and in 2009 he was appointed chief medical officer in Diepholz County and volunteered in the DRK @-@ readiness Bruchhausen @-@ Vilsen .
from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
his wife Ursel ( Internistin ) specializes in gastroenterology .
the garbage makers , both internists , want to settle as family doctors .
&quot; the endoscopy therefore comes out , &quot; says 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gongoll .
after reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long @-@ term and stress EKGS and need a speaker room more .
in addition , the EDV is completely renewed .
a total grant of € 50000 will be paid to the trash farmers under a grant programme from the county ( € 25,000 ) and the Samtgemeinde ( € 12500 ) and the municipality ( € 12500 ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue , &quot; notes sampling director Bernd Bormann .
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gongoll , about 2,000 patients come into practice each quarter , in which North German average practice is about 500 .
in Asendorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in Asendorf , according to Ursel Felsteausen .
if no successor had found herself , she would have gone .
if you are visiting refuse speakers , you will continue to look mainly at familiar faces : the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the field .
with their departure , an era ends in Asendorf , after all , physicians practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ursel Felsteausen remembers .
a bit of cheerfulness is already feeling it after the long time .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients often , &quot; says the Internistin .
her husband added laughingly : &quot; we have a 6000 @-@ square @-@ foot plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I &apos;ve always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also ramping up on our southern border , &quot; Interior Minister Johanna Mikl @-@ Leitner said .
controls on the Hungarian border remain consistent .
it is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can make it &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot;
people &apos;s care and safety are at the forefront .
but it is also clear that &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; the minister said .
people need to know that we do not accept boundless migratory flows , not even via the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia weighs &apos; corridor &apos; - Slovenia denied
the Croatian Government had previously informed that Slovenia also wanted to allow incoming refugees to travel to Austria and Germany and could also set up corridors for refugees .
however , this was not the case in Laibach .
the idea of corridors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; but Slovenia will intensify the monitoring of the border , especially with Hungary .
the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slowenin does not want to unlock his borders on refugees .
&quot; any EU member must comply with its obligations otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; stressed GYÖRKÖS Znidar .
as the Croatian Government indicated , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours of Tuesday to travel past Tovarnik / Sid border crossing in eastern Croatia to avoid registration .
Croatian police were able to pick them up in nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in Croatia &apos;s Tovarnik region since then .
they are mainly Syrians and Afghans , including many women and children .
emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country is counting around 4000 refugees , Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said .
moreover , buses from Presevo on the Macedonian @-@ Serbian border , which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would be diverted towards Croatia , Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade denied , however , that it was to suggest to the people that certain routes should be taken : &quot; neither can we , nor do we , &quot; it said .
in any case , according to media reports , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning , and more buses would be expected during the day .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the inmates had been travelling all night from Serbia &apos;s roughly 500 @-@ kilometer Macedonian border .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has done so , so the police have told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel further through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to the postponement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary , already predicted by observers .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees .
he did not mention details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive border control capabilities . &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership of the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU &apos;s partners have been consistently reporting to the country on the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , some 300 refugees remain stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrader &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the Horgos border crossing , which leads to Röszke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local show in Horgos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees to be premature after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be very high numbers of refugees at the moment .
it is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
aid workers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun distributing maps to refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not undangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still uncovered mines 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , Croatian police announced that a team of miners was sent to the border region .
stock market hackers : Ukrainians pay $ 30 million
Supranonok is said to have heard a ring of cybercriminals accused of repeatedly gaining insight into yet unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010 .
the leaked information is said to have made insider dealing in financial markets .
in this way , according to investigators , more than $ 100 million was received .
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately caught , &quot; the SEC statement said .
the trials against 32 other defendants in the case continued .
most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .
Ecumenical hospice aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a good operation .
people do their concerns , some quick paces , some cosy bumbling .
they control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalon at Paradeplatz .
keep trams .
pulsating , prall life with glorious autumn sunshine and in four large panels each with the headline &quot; I &apos;m dying &quot; ....
the Ecumenical hospice aid drew attention to its 20 @-@ year existence and is facing mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we &apos;ve gone with the action in the middle of town and among the people , &quot; says Josefine Lammer .
the head of Ecumenical hospice assistance is available to the passers @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations as the volunteers .
while manch spontaneously picks up a passer @-@ by and admits the phrase around &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; read , &quot; &quot; with the camper driving through the US , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer long , &quot; others stay short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
time and again , small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter Hübinger is also just on the ground .
&quot; only by making it clear to me that at some point the end of this world is coming , I can live responsibly , &quot; says the director of the Diakonic Plant Mannheim , which is co @-@ operating with the Caritan Federation of Ecumenical Hospitals .
therefore , this high @-@ profile action for 20 @-@ year @-@ olds is good .
it is understandable , however , that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards , but it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and dying remains fraught with taboos , according to the experience of Josefine Lammer , although just the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to people opening up .
an assessment that shares Angelika Godefroid .
the death and marriage attendant is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia .
when the Ecumenical hospice aid sought honor official by calling , she immediately reported and was present at the foundation in 1995 .
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 honorary officials - 43 women and two men - who are involved in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the Hospiz of St Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
Angelika Godefroid can do well with her job and experience and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another waiting , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says .
the offer of the ambulance Ecumenical hospice service is free and confessional .
the financial support of health insurance funds and donations from family members and clubs enables training , training and supervisions of death and marriage attendants .
every two years training courses are offered for new employees .
the panels described on Saturday are now on display at the House of the Evangelical Church ( M1 , 1a ) and at the House of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
further personal requests can also be noted on postcards .
FedEx earnings mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter , and the berth giant cut its profit outlook to a full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground sports service .
the company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the stock fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
FedEx Corp. said it earned a profit of between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May , 20 cents less than at the previous forecast .
analysts expected $ 10.84 , according to a survey by FactSet .
the lower outlook comes despite the increase in prices , which averages 4.9 per cent and will be effective on 4 January , despite higher premiums for ground sports from heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said it still expects earnings to increase compared with the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and because of growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot; provides solid returns when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of rival UPS , which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended August 31 , FedEx earned $ 692 million , 6 percent more than the previous year .
earnings per share were $ 2.42 per share , just below the $ 2.44 per share forecast by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research .
sales rose 5 percent to $ 12.3 billion .
six of Zacks surveyed analysts expected $ 12.23 billion .
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years , bringing sales in its unit Express shipments to stagnate .
but the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in ground racing rose 29 percent , but operating earnings were basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while earnings fell due to higher labor costs in the cargo business .
in premarket trading , about an hour before the opening , FedEx shares fell $ 3.85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 150.15 .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the ladder for the first time in nearly a decade .
drowning over them at an end to the decorated , two @-@ story sitting room is a mural of the United States .
the card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are expected to put the nation &apos;s economic interests ahead of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : maximizing U.S. employment and prices here to keep steady .
but since the Great Recession , Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an undefeated third mandate : financial stability .
and that third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it , and it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is starved to be defused by the unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since late 2008 .
although most data from the economy show that it is growing solid , recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already cautious Fed officials anxious to step up that volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds - and be it just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing they watch , &quot; said Lindsey M. Piegza , chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the Fed will do , which in itself inhibits the financial market .
about half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently predicted a rate increase this week .
financial markets , however , expect a delay from the Fed , with a key indicator showing only a 30 per cent chance of an increase .
this suggests a fall in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far off .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16,599.85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the rate this week , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the Fed lifted rates at this time , &quot; he said .
if she does , &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm financial markets so they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
even a month ago , the Fed seemed on track to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed , she expects an increase in the rate .
although job creation slowed in August , the improvement in the labour market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , Fed officials said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics .
but financial markets around the world poured together late last month after China devalued its currency .
the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 16 % below its peak in May as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would cut global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , with the Dow now down nearly 10 % below May &apos;s peak .
for Fed officials , market turmoil affects complex calculation of when to raise interest rates .
&quot; if events in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the reins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. Oliner , Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. Federal Reserve employee .
now he predicts she will wait at least a month to get better grip on the impact .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; Oliner said .
the health of the global economy is not one of the Fed &apos;s main concerns , so it should not technically be included in its decision @-@ making process .
but ultimately , the Fed has become the world &apos;s monetary authority .
the central bank &apos;s influence has been huge in recent years .
the mere indication by then @-@ leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zachary Karabell , head of global strategy for the asset management of Envestnet Inc .
Jeffrey Lacker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the Fed has a history of overreaction to financial market movements associated with apparently not the economic fundamentals . &quot;
Lacker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , in favour of an increase in interest rates , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to lower its interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognizable impact on growth in the US , &quot; Lacker said .
a year later , Fed officials reversed those cuts .
the Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. Posen , former member of the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate fixing committee .
recent turmoil is not coming near that level , he said .
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rate increase because markets are getting upset , &quot; said Posen , president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should advance time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LAX @-@ C in Chinatown .
yes , Chinatown
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX @-@ C Inc .
Lax @-@ C is often called Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public .
yes , he is in Chinatown and not in Thai Town .
the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations .
there is even a car department when you need engine oil .
the store is huge and it takes over an hour to wander through the gears .
if the whole shopping mall makes you hungry , there &apos;s a meal in the LAX @-@ C BBQ Express for you .
the gardening ( good and inexpensive ) in this store is near the coffers and has various co @-@ acceptance options .
what &apos;s there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
Lax @-@ C probably did .
products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruit and much more .
the meat counter is extensive , as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean the fish and fix it and even serve you on request .
a good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department , where you will find frozen curry leaves , bitter melon and ggant , whole ducks , fish , bovine blood and gall , pig nature darm , fish balls , regional sausage , commercially prepared food and more .
who buys here : restaurant owners and chefs , including individual families and individuals .
the wide gears are suitable for shopping cars and forklifts .
you can find here : fresh Monthong Durian next to the box office .
where he is located : the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original .
parking : Lax @-@ C has its own parking lot , along with other shops and restaurants .
even if the store is well attended , it &apos;s not hard to find a parking lot .
Hoyerswerda : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless volunteers .
in Hoyerswerda , too , there are a number of people who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city .
they include Petra and Klaus Heine .
Petra Heine is a teacher with a body and soul .
she is also happy to teach her 74 runs .
every Thursday , she does it in the asylum seeker &apos;s home on Dillinger Street .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different from a school .
Brazil &apos;s paediatric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
the Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS is trying , in a shocking way , to educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breast @-@ feeding .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make .
a recent study led by Robert Waterland , a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors .
unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
the local council Bernried approved the construction application for the € 2.3 million sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar systems .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited tower building at the Bernrieder Sportgrounds are progressing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the elaborated construction application was unanimously approved without major discussions .
previously , among other things , the panel had adopted a request for a construction &quot; exception &quot; to &quot; respectful &quot; exemption &quot; from the valid bebaut plan .
the &quot; exception &quot; concerned permission for a special form regarding roof construction .
thus , a &quot; semi @-@ roof with a non @-@ attached first and attic &quot; is to be built .
background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations : &quot; this brings us together a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; Mayor Josef Steigenberger said at the meeting .
the &quot; liberation &quot; was , in turn , about the attainment , which should be below 10 degrees for energy reasons , unlike the Bebauplan .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was needed because the balloon plan does not allow &quot; exceptions &quot; to the roof - with the Bernrieder local council usually more restrictive in the case of exemptions .
however , Turnbull is not a recurring project : &quot; we are not setting a precedent , &quot; says Steigenberger .
Turnhallenbau am Sportzzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried .
around EUR 2.3 million is calculated at a cost .
grants are expected from school and grassroots sports funding .
in the next stage of the procedure , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters hall will now be submitted to the county board for consideration .
clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau
the Peißenberg hospital is expected to be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes new Medical Director at Schongau Hospital .
the station and the majority of the staff move from Peißenberg to Schongau .
this is what the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the Landkreis , the Councilman Andrea Jochner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
however , a decision will be taken by the Supervisory Board and will be taken next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are implemented , all of the nearly 50 staff at Peißenberg hospital would be further employed .
the vast majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the wider inside station .
the rooms are there .
the staff who cannot work with Schongau is to be offered a job in Weilheim , according to Jochner @-@ White .
staff were informed about the plans .
the change triggered the dismissal of Dr. Andreas Eder , who has only been a medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now switches to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
on the question of who is to enter the succession , according to Jochner @-@ White , the name &quot; fisherman &quot; came into play who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and switch to Schongau with his team .
for the house in Schongau , this in any case meant &quot; appreciation &quot; and a broadening of the offer in the field of internal medicine , according to Jochner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators .
Schongau ( 180 beds ) specializes in gastroenterological diseases .
over the next two years , Fischer is expected to run both houses with his team if the Supervisory Board agrees to run both houses until next year &apos;s former hospital of the Knappie , which still has 35 beds , in Peißenberg after nearly 140 years .
so far , the county had planned this for 2018 when the current clean @-@ up at Weilheim hospital is completed .
Landrätin Jochner @-@ White , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , resigned rumours that the House , which is owned by the federal government , would in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; I exclude that , &quot; as the property continues , Jochner @-@ White couldn &apos;t say there are several considerations .
there is currently a short @-@ term care of Caritas and a daily psychiatry .
&quot; what better couldn &apos;t happen to us , such an opportunity doesn &apos;t come again , &quot; Fischer said about the quasi @-@ move to the lech , which had been received by the staff &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot;
there has been no real prospect for the house where fishermen have been working as chief doctor for over 30 years .
he was asked by Schongauer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
Peißenberg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) has been under constant threat of closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example , surgery and birth support .

hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured by shots during their corn harvest Tuesday afternoon .
several hunters were deployed while on a corn field at Pratau ( County Wittenberg ) , according to police .
after a shooting death , a 63- and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was first unclear .
the Crime Police are investigating .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palatinate victim of violent crime
a crime scene has led police to the corpse of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds missing from Rheinland @-@ Palatinate since Saturday .
in interrogation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted killing young people and throwing their corpse into a canal in Rockenhausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palatinate since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the young woman &apos;s body was found Tuesday night in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern , as prosecutors and police said Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was also arrested on Tuesday night , was deemed to be acting as a suspect , leading investigators to the site of the corpse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after not coming home as agreed on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen .
in the search for the young woman , investigators first encountered personal belongings of the victim .
in the case of interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing , a crime was finally found against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetrator then led police to a canal in Rockenhausen where the corpse was found .
the arrested , according to authorities , admitted in the police interrogation that killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and placed the corpse in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was due to face the detention centre on Wednesday , investigators charging him homicide .
further investigations should be carried out into the near circumstances of the act .
refugees need shelter : study warns of housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is tense .
more and more refugees are also seeking affordable lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
distribution struggles in the German housing market have long begun .
with incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens for the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 .
this result comes a study on behalf of the &quot; Social Housing Association . &quot;
by comparison , 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year .
that leaves 140,000 homes missing .
refugees are no longer obliged after the first three months of their stay to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many then enter the housing market and line up in the long queues before the rental apartments .
according to the Federal Statistical Office , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees .
the study also makes significant failings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is wrong with a housing deficit that will grow year @-@ on @-@ year .
currently around 770,000 units were missing in the population areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study , complains .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG rooms .
young adults remained involuntarily in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the fuss in the housing market .
in large cities , the number of square metres per head has fallen again for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Social Housing Alliance proposes a reboot .
new incentives are expected to boost social housing .
for example , the basic tax could be waived and the basic tax on subsidised housing could be suspended on a temporary basis .
moreover , the alliance requires attractive tax deductions .
the state bank KfW refugee programme is already well received by cities and municipalities .
a good week after the launch on Monday night , with 184 million euros , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been retrieved .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia launch corridor
after Hungary there is virtually no more progress , as more and more refugees are choosing the way through Croatia .
Zagreb announces its intention to grant transit over Slovenia to the north without hurdles .
however , the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to reach agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a refugee corridor .
&quot; I have spoken to the Slovenian Home Secretary and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
following the closure of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to enter Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik , Croatian television broadcaster RTL reports .
Hungary closed its border for refugees on the previous day .
new laws that came into force on the same day also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said : &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , they are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police picked up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border with Croatia .
most came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan , according to media reports .
they arrived both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid .
immediately after their arrival , they had tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
the refugees do not encounter border fences on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border .
there are other risks to this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s .
mine cleaners are now expected to quickly create a safe passage .
however , after Hungary closed the border , there are few more refugees .
on Tuesday , police counted 366 recorded people .
shortly before Torture on Monday , it was still 9380 .
the new Hungarian laws constitute an offence to overcome and damage the border zone .
35 criminal proceedings have therefore been initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged .
convicts face jail sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the Immigration Department , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; transit zones , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - were in the main transition .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
there were 40 refugees there Wednesday morning .
in practice , however , no one has any chance of obtaining asylum in Hungary .
in the Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered before the &quot; transit zone &quot; in Röszke .
in Röszke , workers started to clean up .
they gathered the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks .
locks were dismantled and one of the reception staff in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the aim of this restructuring .
Austria still has few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
it has also strengthened its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants were still in the country , according to government figures .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the orders of German authorities .
in open air , smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot .
Mayor drove &apos; Gestrants &apos; across the border
&quot; we were busy with the cleanup after the bridge festival on Sunday , when suddenly 10 people stood with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; Wearns Mayor Alois Stadler said .
tourists , they wanted by train to Passau .
however , because Germany unexpectedly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees , it was in Wernstein that stopped , &quot; said Stadler , who immediately offered his help and chased the Gestrants along with two other helpers and their cars across the border into the nearby Passau .
prior to that , we have only downgraded the unsolicited guests once , with jause and drinks .
we just said we &apos;re bringing them to Passau by car .
&quot; it was natural for us , &quot; Stadler said in the OÖN conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t take it to pass a generous donation - £ 100 for the fire department .
&quot; we were very pleased about that , &quot; Stadler said .
the stranded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train to Passau on Sunday evening , after the short @-@ term proclamation that rail traffic was stopped in Germany , but still trying over the border .
however , the regional train was departed from the border in Wernstein am Inn .
in Wernstein , cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brückenfest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , a two @-@ day tour of sport - organized by Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen .
the fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending us further quotes is a logical result of a hypocritical policy :
instead of helping Röszke in the Röszke camp immediately to establish structures that guarantee humanity , our Chancellor has made the Hungarian Government &apos;s attitude to national socialism highly official and publicly .
the leaders of this policy are not only the Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas .
poultry will also have to note that the &quot; promised country &quot; it invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp .
it will be a major challenge , given the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter , to establish decent conditions for those seeking protection .
and it will be an even greater one - maintaining peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35,000 wintry quarterbacks
Konrad has all the hands to do with refugee assistance .
Christian Konrad is used to saying that his word has weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to establish quartiers for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in Traiskirchen &apos;s initial reception centre has already brought Konrad to grips .
&quot; we no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen , &quot; he told his first success .
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who arrived to Austria on Monday was also carried out without a great whistle , Konrad said , praising the organizational &quot; mastermind . &quot;
the Home Office , on the other hand , was talking about a &quot; crisis situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarterbacks this year .
to meet the number , there are still 35,000 shelters to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if more refugees become , we can do it .
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; Konrad said .
he has already held talks with the state &apos;s leaders .
they would have assured him of creating quartiers for the future refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s going well , &quot; Ferry Maier said .
the former VP Mandatar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the church will help .
the Asylum Coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF action &quot; Help like us . &quot;
on the platform , individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation .
there are also hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that receivers have to meet a certain amount of the towel holder or size of the upper lights .
for a limited period of time , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply .
the fact that he is more successful than the Ministry of the Interior in housing is based on his experience .
I am an older gentleman who is not easily told the untruth .
persuasion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Maier do not cost the Republic , as they themselves explained .
their staff want to increase them to three to four .
your own quest has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with approval .
Linz calls for better division
for now , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planned by the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Luger ( SP ) .
for the emergency , however , other sites are to be examined for their suitability .
the city leader is critical of the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute to this .
Hakofer : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer ( CSU ) , state chief Josef Pühringer ( VP ) on Monday calculated the way forward on the refugee issue .
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be closed .
the return of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , we now have border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will not exist for the time being .
however , protection seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue from the other EU member states .
the fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; for Pühringer .
the next Runtastic is a matter of time
the general renovation of the &quot; New Werft &quot; in the Linzer industrial line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly traded IT group S &amp; T has moved , the rest ( 2700 square feet ) is to be rented out to young , innovative technology companies .
&quot; in IT , the wise heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; S &amp; T chief executive Hannes Niederhauser says .
he could imagine investing in Startup companies of the New Werft and later making them more accurate .
from the beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - something Niederhauser promises to do : &quot; the next Runtastic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the TechCenter , which belongs to one third of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FFG ) .
the building is leased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and TechCenter .
30 percent of the 2700 square feet of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
LIA Peroni owner opened second store in Arkade
the new shop focuses on furla handbags .
in fact , Jutta Breit wanted to raise a dog .
this project had to put up the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt Arkade with a curfew : after all , she has now got an increase in the form of another business location .
in the furla shop opposite the shop , where it sells bags , suitcases , shoes and faces from various manufacturers , everything is now about ladies &apos; handbags of the Furla brand , wallets from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
it has been rebuilt several weeks before .
&quot; I have , however , long considered whether I should open a store yet , &quot; Breit says .
among other things , the decision was based on the fact that the furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also attracted by the idea of a separate location where only their handbags are sold .
&quot; we are the only ones in the Linz area selling this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who has Italian roots himself .
her fashion interest has put Breit in the cradle by her mother .
I find most of all when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women get into consumption when looking at a nice handbag , the specialist cannot answer with certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag evaluates every outfit .
the Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
Donald Trump &apos;s counterpart ancestors came from a place whose residents are called residents .
this feature also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become US president .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether it is xenophobic , it concerns journalists , or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US Presidential Office is actively stirring up the campaign .
and does well .
this is also registered in the pastoral Kallstadt , where the grandparents of the property billionaire come from .
the New Yorker with the Föhnfrisur is a term for many in the Winzerdorf on the Wine Road .
some in the 1,200 @-@ inhabitant place is more than -zig corners with it .
his grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz : Donald Trump , here in campaign mode .
Kallstadt @-@ based Simone Wendel turned a film about Trump .
and what do villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think those find this somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their causal way , &quot; says Simone Wendel .
the native Kallurbanist has shot an amusing documentary about the place and its famous explosions , which include , alongside Trump , the Ketchup family Heinz .
Trump , who is not known for modesty , is also speaking in &quot; Kings of Kallstadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , so with the statement that he would certainly succeed if he lived in Kallstadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
while there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , Trump also tends to think that Trump is &quot; already a bit of a big maul , &quot; Wendel says .
coincidentally , the nickname that Kallstadt has in the perimeter is &quot; The Brulljesmacher &quot; - to Hochdeutsche : the Anders , she says .
so Trump comes from the village of investors .
Trump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a pub for gold graves in the US .
the real estate group was founded in New York .
but the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to the home in the long term failed at the Bavarian state , which belonged to the Pfalz at the time .
he did not include Trump because he was once without approval , the director of the Institute of Pole History and People &apos;s Party , Roland Paul , declared the film launch .
Trump is the grandson of an &quot; illegal emigration . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of descendants .
the had spoken repeatedly about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the padded , this is not so sympathetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Bender , a distant relative of Trump ( &quot; The Oma was a native Trump , the Opa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the winemaker in retirement looks more distanced to the Americans , &quot; he &apos;s always so startling . &quot;
does he think Trump will come ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never got around Kallstadt . &quot;
the pensioner Veronika Schramm mentioned , like some Kallstadter , that a descendent of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally good .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from the Donald , &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says .
they are better off if he doesn &apos;t know the election , because &quot; the one has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
if those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the US had been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting issues than him , &quot; says winemaker Sarah Bühler .
and as president ?
&quot; my president isn &apos;t , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe even without President Trump . &quot;
Wendel &apos;s film , for which Trump has long been interviewed , has seen 12,000 cinematographers , including in the US awakened interest .
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany &apos;s first mountain climbing village .
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the Deutsche Alpenverein , Ludwig Wucherpfennig , the 1800 @-@ inhabitant village in Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
there are already 20 mountain climbers in Austria .
in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award .
a mountain climbing village may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
Seven &apos;s Sunrise dominates the ratings despite attempts by Nine to take on the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson hurried to Canberra to report in the wake of the loss of the Liberal leader , but it did not provide major shifts in the ratings for Today .
Nine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the state capital when Malcolm Turnbull made the fall of Tony Abbott .
the rival Sunrise , with moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage , put in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television shows , including Dubai , New York , Niagara Falls and Cancun .
that disadvantage of the standoff did not seem to matter to Australian TV viewers as Sunrise scored an average of 397,000 viewers at the five capitals , compared to Today &apos;s 339,000 .
today posted a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 317,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 283,000 ) , but its number fell short of last Thursday &apos;s ( 343,000 ) .
today , the Sunrise gap has closed in recent months .
in August , Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise &apos;s 330,000 .
at the start of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 passed .
so far in September , Sunrise stands at an average 349,000 viewers at 314,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson .
the new drama about a recently widowed father who disagrees to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive figure of 1.219 million viewers .
critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit @-@ show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney .
last night &apos;s result answered this with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block ( 838,000 ) and TBL Families ( 726,000 ) .
seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show , moderated by Andrew O &apos;Keefe , showed an average of 446,000 viewers .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 a.m. to 18 : 00 p.m. ) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuires Hot @-@ Seat ( 613,000 ) .
on Monday night , the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 viewers and 720,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ Seat average 620,000 .
the drop in the odds of the second evening of The Chase Australia will reassure Nine that Hot @-@ Seat will eventually prevail at 17 : 30 a.m.
the Chase Australia is a replacement for $ million minute that failed to override the McGuires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery reveals ? ...
Lana Jeavons @-@ Fellows , Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly shown who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at whom Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , was holed up in greatest secrecy .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah Mackay , Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons @-@ Fellows on the day before being out of three , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have been left out lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man , calling his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive Woods last rose ? &quot; their answers to the playoff could become who won the heart of the bachelor .
Jeavons @-@ Fellows and Markoski both quickly - except themselves - called Mackay the best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarahs ) and Sams Energies , because I felt they were pretty compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Jeavons @-@ Fellows said .
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Markoski added .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , Mackay said that last week &apos;s home visit made her clear that Wood could be &quot; the one . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now unreservedly hired on him , &quot; she said .
and when asked who Wood should choose if not , she was puzzling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between Snezana and Lana .
the bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open training day late last year .
but Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision .
some coaches would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game on the bench as he lost a scramble as the Aussie rugby league conversion did at his first point return on Tuesday in the 20 @-@ 3 win against Minnesota .
but Tomsula trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a punt return and also into the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush .
Tomsula continued to show his real face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his rookies off the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tomsula also bolstered Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey , who advised him to forget his patchy catch and take care of the next game .
Jarryd Hayne patches at a punt restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter
it certainly wasn &apos;t the start Hayne and his massive Australian entourage had hoped for his NFL debut .
Hayne left the pitch after the fumble flustered and later told Australian radio duo Hamish &amp; Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career ,
&quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just care about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hayne said .
Hayne compared the carving with his Origin debut at the time in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Goal area led to a try for Queensland .
overall , it was nonetheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
Hayne posed for a photo with fans while holding an Australian flag after the game and poked it on his Instagram .
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights

outdoors voters are demanding the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees .
party and group chief executive Hubert Aiwanger warned at the start of the FW Autumn Clause in Grosswallstadt before a serious crisis at Bayerns schools if there are no corresponding new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; Aiwanger said .
&quot; otherwise we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the outdoor voter survey is scheduled to open until Friday in the underground commune .
there were actually very different main issues .
but the record number of refugees now dominates the free voter meeting .
&quot; of course , the issue of asylum will overstore the clawing , &quot; Aiwanger said .
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it existed during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; so it doesn &apos;t go on , we have to get to the causes , &quot; the Free voter chief said .
rejected asylum seekers want to defer free voters as soon as possible .
that is why Aiwanger also required more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum actions : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; Aiwanger said .
the FW chief criticised the fact that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; we needed uniform federal standards . &quot;
&quot; Bayern are shifting , others not . &quot;
&quot; there we need to be more effective . &quot;
but national politics in Grosswallstadt should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing burner remains on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , Culture Minister Ludwig Spaenle ( CSU ) started the pilot &quot; middle stage plus &quot; at 47 gymnasies , where an extension of the gymnasial middle stage is tested from three to four years - as a result , it will take nine years to finish .
but that doesn &apos;t go Aiwanger far enough .
&quot; the issue of G9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; the FW chief said .
we demand freedom of choice for all grammar students who want it .
free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired .
firm Wall Street helps Dax on the jumps
the German stock market has closed with profits after a long and nervous trading process .
it was only in the afternoon that a more marked uptick in the US stock exchanges caused a clear direction that ultimately pushed the Dax down 0.56 per cent to 10 188.13 points .
the MDax middleweight gained 0.54 percent to 19 552.88 points .
the technology @-@ resilient TecDax rose 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points .
the EuroStoxx 50 as the eurozone &apos;s leading index fell 1.01 per cent to 3207.60 points .
solid profits also boosted trading venues in London and Paris .
in the US , the Dow Jones index last reported about 1 percent in the plus .
many stock market analysts expect markets to step down until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the big decline in futures exchanges this Friday .
the discussion of the burden of nuclear emissions has pushed RWE &apos;s shares to a record low , leaving deep marks at Eon .
according to Spiegel , Germany &apos;s energy companies may lack EUR 30 billion in reserves .
the federal government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
shares of the two largest German energy companies subsequently recovered somewhat , but eventually lost 3.31 percent ( RWE ) and 6.15 percent ( Eon ) .
Infineon shares rose another 3.22 percent at the Dax peak .
according to one retailer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Barron &apos;s &quot; from the weekend was followed .
so investors are currently paying too little attention to the German chipmaker .
investment in future @-@ oriented wafer technologies and focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were asked : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were cut off again than in the same period last year , as the industry association Acea announced to launch the IAA International Motor Show in Frankfurt .

4 people killed after police fired rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official said Wednesday .
the violence erupted Tuesday night in the Rupanstreti district , about 175 miles west of the capital , Kathmandu .
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal , senior district official , said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station , with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs .
MR Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets .
twenty police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used , known to be able to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there have also been protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clashes since 10 .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries .
work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in town
the plot at the Emder Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square @-@ foot area .
a mix of trade , trade and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a roughly 4,000 square foot plot in direct proximity to the youth centre of Alte Post .
preparations are under way .
it is planned to use the site for a mix of trade , trade and housing .
we were waiting for special offers .
the investor is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts have yet been concluded .
the city of Emden had bought part of the plot , which is located on the Ring Street / corner of Great Street , a few months ago and had to demolish the building on it .
project Hieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement on the Little Sea at Emden take shape .
the investor first made public plans for the project .
several residents are still worried - they fear the outlet of their recreational refugitive
for months , negotiations had been held behind closed doors , grinned , debated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday resort on the small sea near Emden are on the table .
the interested party , the medium @-@ sized Emder company &quot; System @-@ Building , &quot; presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the Vice @-@ President &apos;s Urban Development Committee .
this point was originally on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the FDP group , which accused investors and the administration of secrecy , Ralf Behrends went on the offensive from the system @-@ building management board : &quot; we have not yet answered all the questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to confront all the rumors now .
the EUR 10 to 12 million project has been under discussion for months .
fierce reactions among sea buyers who had entered the meeting called the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , sea buyer owner and board member at the Anlieger &apos;s advocacy group , Pro Hieve , complains : &quot; this is going to be a giant clotch that will surprise all the other blows . &quot;
he also fears , like many other project critics , that traffic would increase significantly by the intended size of the plant : &quot; there must be whole bus charges for that to happen , &quot; says Schulz
however , what is happening on the well one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent approach , &quot; Ralf Behrends said .
because this was still missing , the construction plans are still variable .
twin offspring at Gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
the Frankfurt Zoo is pleased with its young children .
the 26 @-@ year @-@ old Dian brought twins to the world yesterday .
twin births are rare at Gorillas .
the last at a German zoo is nearly 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967 , according to the zoo .
the sex of newborn Gorilla twins is not yet firmly established , as mother Dian keeps them close to the body so far .
first , the &quot; picture &quot; had been reported .
NHC predicts 60 % chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde islands
the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday a broad low pressure system is about 350 miles ( 560 kilometers ) south of the southernmost Cape Verde islands , which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours .
another clearly defined low pressure system , for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles , also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone over the next two days , added the weather experts stationed in Miami .
Google launches double @-@ donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Googl @-@ O ) announced a double @-@ donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overtaken European nations as they flee war @-@ torn and impoverished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach in announcing the donation call on its blog .
rather than let a manager make the announcement , Rita Masoud , a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; to our trip included a lot of dark rail and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are desperately looking for help .
the donations go to four nonprofit organizations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Borders , International Rescue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees .
Google said the first globally collected donations will double to $ 11 million from $ 5.5 million on google.com / refugeerelief .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .
many also fled the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for slightly overweight diabetics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years , according to a new study .
it is too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Blackstone , an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations to treat type 2 diabetes have proved efficient , but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill @-@ balanced with a body @-@ mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 , comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach bypass and stomach flashes - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BMI remained close to 29 among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments .
among those undergoing surgical surgery , 36 % of diabetes completely and 28 % did so .
in the medically @-@ treated group , compared to this , diabetes completely broke only one percent and in part at just about two percent .
in addition , the results in controls on blood pressure , triglyceride and the &quot; bad &quot; LDL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hemmoglobin A1c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
Hämoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent , researchers write .
after the operation , the average Hämoglobin A1c level fell from about 9 per cent to around 6 per cent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; glycemic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved Hämoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to lead researcher Dr. Chih @-@ Cheng Hsu and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the Bypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the host recruiting group ( 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg ) , achieved larger declines in the BMI ( 7.4 against 5.1 ) and Hämoglobin A1c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and more marked a complete elimination of the diabetes .
while the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer life , says Blackstone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was among obese people undergoing obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long to get people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think that once they have collected these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a reversal is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in Hunsrück
it is an issue that is currently becoming increasingly important in the field of Belgian tourism : a young woman , unpopular at school times and unsightly , meets the swarm of her youth after years , and she fell in love with her .
so even in the recently released novel &quot; Own we &apos;re not so &quot; by Luisa Binder .
beyond love history , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for Hunsbacker readers , because it plays in Langweiler and surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accommodate all refugees , the Dalai Lama said , adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his 10 @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents under the circumstances .
he also stressed that while Western European countries &apos; response to the refugee crisis was admirable , the situation was not adequate .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to address the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
ultimately , we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
we must reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence , and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the September 11 terrorist attack , noting that the US &apos;s violent response resulted in a string of uncontrollable events .
after 11 September , I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; the Dalai Lama said .
four @-@ fold increase in intake of suspended drugs by children over the past 4 years
toxic Control Centres in the US report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants , according to the Georgia Poison Center .
according to Dr. Gaylord Lopez , director of the Georgia Poison Center , the cases of revenue from hand disinfectants in children under the age of 12 who report poison control centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are landing in the emergency , &quot; Lopez told CNN .
he said some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of a mutation among social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience .
young people reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol @-@ containing oral water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; Lopez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand disinfectants ) are those that are perfumed .
there are disinfectant drugs with strawberry , grapes and orange fragrances that are very appealing to children .
suspended infections contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for infants , few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning .
&quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thornton , medical director of the Giftnotcall Center at the University of Kansas , told CNN 4 in Kansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t let a sip of whisky around , but people leave this hand disinfectant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
Nhaijah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four syringes from after strawberry fragrant suspended infection at school , was taken into an emergency reception for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold legally considered drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Ritchey , an emergency medical doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
Nhaijah lent her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight at a separate child &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had encountered her head , Ritchey said .
&quot; it was very scary , &quot; Ortoria Scott , Nhaijahs mother , told CNN .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinfectants and store suspended infections outside the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol poisoning , some disinfectants were linked to deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women following the swallowing of suspended infection , which included a toxic , undeclared ingredient .
health officials suspect the product contained methanol , a deadly solution , rather than ethyl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of fourth grade in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by issuing antibacterial products around the classroom , &quot; a police report reports .
the teacher is highly allergic to suspended infection and served her out of her room .
police viewed the failed plan as a &quot; garbage &quot; and referred disciplinary action to the school authority .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dutch - de Boer
the former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers .
de Boer , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they don &apos;t show highlights of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the Rangers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers .
you talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams together and that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested in .
there &apos;s a lot of tension in the Old Firm games , and it &apos;s not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games .
I &apos;ll turn things around , swears Deila .
Ronny Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around .
after defeat to Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aberdeen , who are now clear at the top of the table with five points ahead .
but Deila said , &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we &apos;ll come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel exactly that way - but we must continue .
we really need , really the support of Celtic because that makes players better .
standing together is so important .
Warburton cautious on January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , which indicated that he was inciting some January transfers , Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new entrants and insists he does not want to disrupt the unit of the Ibrox cadre .
the ex @-@ head of Brentford said : &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
the players who come in summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you &apos;ve seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target man Michu with withdrawal card

Hearts on SFA battle set for Neilson &apos;s comments
the Hearts led 2 : 1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the defense &apos;s red card was later lifted - Collum &apos;s third red card , which was revoked in eight months .
Neilson remains at what he said , insisting : &quot; I didn &apos;t question integrity , I didn &apos;t comment on any performance . &quot;
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
the impromptu Hibee was denied after admitting to having sung a song with offensive lyrics about ex @-@ Hearts player Rudi Skacel .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Derby , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; the striker said , adding : &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Tynecastle if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;

McInnes glad to win against Hamilton . &quot;
Derek McInnes conceded that his team from Aberdeen had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh successive league victory that gave them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooneys penalty yards in the first half .
McInnes said : &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in postseason games or leagues that have not won games of this kind either . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it is rising overall in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above that of UKs of 5.5 per cent , as figures from the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) showed .
meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,612,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent .
the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the groundwork for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
in these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I will witness an execution in Oklahoma
a little later today , except for late legal intervention , I will see a man being brought to death .
if it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I &apos;ll sit in a spectator &apos;s gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first made in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day moved closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US , and since more applications are often available as places , a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
whoever is selected will watch it emotionally .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard Glossips &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality .
here &apos;s the lesson .
tell the detainee &apos;s story how he wants it , and you get access .
I complain to her .
she acknowledged that she &quot; could have formulated it better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong , which I do .
Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he did .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks outreach will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bellware , a reporter at the Huffington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of podcasts I &apos;ve made .
I do not want to go back to all the details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent .
his actions after Barry Van Treese &apos;s murder would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act .
but I believe there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I &apos;ll see him die .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
there will be other reporters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after wet police chase persuaded to get out of the Canning River
the Canning Vale policeman remained dry as he retreated the man from the Canning River .
an attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in shallow and sumptuous water , just a few metres from a police officer trying to &quot; persuade him gently to return to the shore . &quot;
canning Vale police were called to a house peace incident in Beckenham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them toward Canning River .
but he didn &apos;t get too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I don &apos;t get out , komm and get me , &apos; &quot; senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said .
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned on a more reliable tactic - &quot; A good policeman is negotiating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; senior Sergeant Castledine said .
championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , Cousins drove his car into the ditches to escape an alcohol check and then tried to swim across the Swan River .
his efforts were unsuccessful but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon .
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately .
he targeted the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried through a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt test at Lidaris , which he cannot explain .
he had withheld 18 months because of the spy allegations and did not want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustrated that everything comes out at once , &quot; Moody said .
you know it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I &apos;ll go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go around elevated principal and I want my owners to think I &apos;m trying my best for them .
if they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , I shouldn &apos;t be coaches anymore .
I then have to consider what I do with my license .
previously , Moody had ramped up the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eighteen months ago Terry Bailey , Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to deliver information about what I &apos;m doing within my stables , &quot; Moody said on Racing.com.
they apparently believe I &apos;m a fraudster .
if that &apos;s the case , they should certainly get to their noses because they failed in trying to catch me .
Robert Roulston , Chairman of the RVL , David Moodie , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the RVL and Bernard Saundry , current CEO of the RVL , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should that make me think that it will be personal ?
did the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps make people outside trainers responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there think I &apos;m .
maybe they have to take my license and violate me , and I have no doubt that what I &apos;m saying is letting them think about it now .
but I have now reached the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will put the pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s frustrating levels have built up with the long @-@ running cobalt investigation at Lidari , and the Late Scratching led him to say he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moody , best known by his preparation of the undefeated champion Black Caviar , called the race day treatment rule &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s legs , which violated the rules .
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
I have to take full responsibility for that , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my staff mistakenly applied mud to the leg .
it could have been like that last night .
it could have been all day yesterday , whatever it was .
it also had it on race day .
Moody could face a three @-@ month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day , an investigation into the matter opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you &apos;ve gone too far , &quot; Moody said .
man arrested after driver &apos;s death
police arrested a man at the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver &apos;s flight in Cobram .
the cyclist was hospitalized with serious injuries with the helicopter at Royal Melbourne Hospital after being hit by a car Saturday morning on the Murray Valley highway .
police said the motorist continued to drive without stopping to help the injured driver .
on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from Nathalia turned to police in Shepparton .
he is expected to be charged with driving and failing assistance and other traffic offences .
the cyclist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cobram remains in hospital and is in a stable condition .
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes down rivals for claims to ring fights
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of the Tackling of his players as &quot; agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League favourites of the NRL .
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled comment to the Storm team after his team scored the final @-@ round victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night , calling the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not &quot; too &quot; in the wrestling .
Bellamy defended his team &apos;s tacklimg and said they were focused only on their &quot; contact &quot; at Tackling .
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches at his team would give him confidence as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; this is recurring - I didn &apos;t hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fighting when they beaten us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bellamy said Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything to our defensive system or techniques throughout the year , but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Taccles a real focus , and that has provided us with the turnaround .
Trent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train , so he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this happens again and again at this time of year .
Bellamy has attacked Bennett &apos;s idea of &quot; thrilling football &quot; and reminded his mentor that Bennett &apos;s St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne talks about exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; Bellamy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of it .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play if you have those kind of players .
he made that statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like these .
I build more confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about having to play against us .
six weeks ago , they probably didn &apos;t think of us when it came to the Big Games .
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm scored a higher score against Roosters than the game Broncos scored against Cowboys .
the Broncos &apos; game was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t looked at it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more tries in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks made and no points somewhat tense ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means we will still meet them at a stage .
the Storm team has been free this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the preliminary finals at AAMI Park .
Serbier with $ 200,000 bail after drug charge
a man who may face life sentence for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released on a bail of $ 200,000 .
Marko Maksimovic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay , which came from South America via Vanuatu and arrived in Coomera in August .
Maksimovic was watched as he met his co @-@ defendants in the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse , where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possible life sentence for trying to own a commercial crowd of cocaine , Maksimovic &apos;s lawyer argued that there was no evidence he was trying to own the whole crowd and that in the cafe for a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flanagan , was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he told the court Wednesday .
on the criminal case , he lied to police about his whereabouts .
Maksimovic &apos;s mother and stepfather had offered a bail of $ 200,000 as a security together to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the ironclad statements of the two people , it is clear that the requirement of a security of $ 200,000 represents a real financial burden , &quot; Judge Flanagan said .
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Maksimovic was released on bail under the terms that he gives off his Australian and Serbian passport , reports to police daily and sticks to a curfew from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : guide house tears apart
a truck driver was seriously injured in a three @-@ truck accident on Highway 5 near Karlsruhe on Tuesday night .
two of the three trucks involved had slowed towards Basel before a permanent construction site .
the third driver noticed it was too late and tried in vain to depart at the last moment to the left , as police said .
the leader of the accident was completely different .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed over six hours to 2 p.m.
it caused a damage of 122,000 euros .
Stevan Hogg used phone from girls to lure paedophiles to send pictures
a paedophile used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
Stevan Hogg took the girl &apos;s phone when this slept , logging into an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg .
she saw it through , found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother .
the police took care of this and saw the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches that used terms for searching indecent images of children .
Hogg then claimed to officials that he did so , since it would lead to &quot; paedophiles on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; pretended to be a policeman to scare them . &quot;
prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction - that he was addicted to frightening people .
he admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer by him , but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophiles .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to lure them .
he said he was sick in the head when he was drinking , and said he then wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
Ms Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trek and on the wine .
she then also saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the defendant .
the girl was interviewed and said the defendant used computers and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him .
Hogg , 23 , of Ward Road , Dundee , pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment to have included indecent images of children on June 14 last year , violating the conditions on January 25 this year and not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 this year .
defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; should be found in his offense .
sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
Hogg was granted bail in that case but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases .
he was added to the register of sexual offenders before the date of judgment .
smugglers divert to small border crossings with Germany
more and more refugees are being picked up outside the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smugglers left people more at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest
out on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the federal police said .
more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the border river Inn in Passau and Rottal Inn since Tuesday .
they had reached the German side on foot via bridges and dams .
there they are received by federal police and forwarded for registration .
at Munich &apos;s main railway station , more refugees arrived again , according to federal police data , compared to Wednesday &apos;s start .
about 700 people arrived in the state capital by 8.00 a.m. alone , a spokesman said in the morning .
after reintroducing controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 1759 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : runner @-@ up of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in southwest expected
meteorologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air is currently flowing into the country , the German Weather Service ( DWD ) said in Stuttgart .
the powerful trough is the outpouring of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which has been drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days .
heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to DWD , the Black Forest , the Swabian Alb and the Lake Constance are also expected to be in the Black Forest until Thursday morning .
on Friday , you can see the sun again .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the automakers on the IAA show their novelties .
in 2015 , the compact cars , which are selling particularly well at the moment , are particularly active .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : about 28.1 percent of new registrations accounted for this segment in August alone , according to Kraftfahrt @-@ Bundesamt ( KBA ) .
this is also reflected on the IAA ( audience days 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models are presented between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new upper class and luxury cars this year .
one of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is Opel Astra , which will be at retailers in the autumn .
&quot; Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; Opel chief Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann said at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order to sell the volume model well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel represents a entry below the largest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from € 16 990 .
the Astra has a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 PS .
in addition , the halves offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW / 95 PS to 147 kW / / / 200 PS , including three @-@ cylinder petrol .
unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only available as a fifth .
the second version will follow in the spring of the Combi , which can be seen on the IAA .
and what &apos;s going to happen next to the Astra on the IAA ?
Renault Mégane : Renault is launching the fourth generation of its Astra rival Mégane .
at the fair , the Mégane can be seen exclusively as a five @-@ belt in a conventional and a stressed sporting GT version .
he comes into the trade early next year , then as a combi .
Infiniti : completely new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30 .
the Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the fast @-@ growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infiniti fits fully into the brand &apos;s design line with its curved lines .
the base model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 horsepower .
on offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Baleno : new to the segment is Suzuki Baleno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with petrol engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbocharger and an output of 82 kW / 111 PS .
the maximum torque is 170 Newton meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact PXI DS 4 , which can be seen on the IAA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Citroën Ableger placed their hand on the front part : here the cooler grill was redrawn and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the infotainment system was modernized , the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen and first integrated Apple &apos;s CarPlay .
in addition , on the IAA in the compact class , a number of overhauls and new variants such as the freshened Mercedes A @-@ class or the Peugeot 308 GTI .
JVA Berlin @-@ Tegel : five square feet of cell are inhumane
the Federal Constitutional Court has given right to an ex @-@ detainee of Justice Tegel , who was housed in one too small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation when housed in too small cells .
that was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision released Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can hope for money even if they were locked in too narrow rooms only a few days ( Az . : 1 BvR 1127 / 14 ) .
in this way , an ex @-@ detainee was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with around five square feet of floor space in the Justice Department of Berlin @-@ Tegel between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated from space .
after that , the man , who is now at large again , according to his lawyer , had been moved to a larger cell .
his arrest was breached because of the indecent conditions of imprisonment against the Land of Berlin .
but the Constitutional Court lifted the ruling of the Chamber Court of Berlin and dismissed the case for re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity violated .
Chamber Court now decides on the level of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of liability for compensation are valid from the period in question , it was said .
otherwise , &quot; a mutilation of the legal protection of personality &quot; would be to be feared .
the Chamber Court must now clarify the level of compensation .
the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they only spoke to a detainee in April for damages because he was naked in a cell .
according to a 2011 decision , the multiple occupancy of a cell without separate toilet is also inhumane .
in addition , Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court , which in a parallel case in November 2009 certified a decent accommodation for a prisoner .
the then plaintiff was housed over three months a day between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karlovy Vary case .
Berlin prisons have also been in the headlines in recent weeks because of a lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore always included for 23 hours , aggressiveness is rising , even to thugs , because of the tense situation .
according to the Justice Department , 21 posts in Tegel are not filled for lack of progress and 19 are to be dropped in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and Refugee Policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what happens to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accommodate one million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create that and we create it . &quot;
the following overview is given to Germany .
according to different forecasts , between 350,000 ( the Federal Ministry of Agriculture &apos;s estimate ) and 400,000 ( the Pestel Institute &apos;s estimate ) homes are needed annually - the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as is being built so far ( 250,000 homes ) .
the lack of housing , however , is dramatic , especially in the case of affordable rental properties : 60 000 to 80 000 social housing each year will be excluded from rental price fixing and refugees will apply for these particularly favourable housing .
Federal Minister for Agriculture Barbara Hendricks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from 518 million currently to one billion euros .
far too little is this from the point of view of the Pestel Institute : 80 000 social housing would have to be created every year and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion per year in this respect .
scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing .
the Institute for Employment and Vocational Research estimates that 55 % of poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them enter , criticising Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation .
however , it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt .
in Germany , according to Thränhardt , there has been a political change : from the ban on the work of refugees to the recognition of work .
while there used to be a ban on the employment of asylum seekers of up to five years , it was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as was the residence requirement , which limits asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society , a majority of people , including the shortage of skilled workers , have taken the view that refugees should be given access to the labour market more quickly .
a major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
there has not yet been a sufficient range of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often taught through personal contacts .
the creation of networks is therefore , in the view of Thränhardt , the premier route to labour integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that few fled parents give their children to the Kitas , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the uprooted parents , it &apos;s only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Ilja Koschembar , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
to convince the family of the benefits of Kita , the administration distributes paperwork in different languages .
should the need for educators rise sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for the lessons .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but also , as in Berlin , by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration .
the German student works estimate that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patient studies - the only exception so far was Berlin , interior senator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned his stance .
student @-@ assisted refugees could be facilitated access to college .
because refugees with a residency allowance or dulling no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Protection Act when they start studying .
the latter do not receive a Bafög in principle , since they do not fall under the circle of the bafiosity .
patient refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for Bafög , from 1 January 2016 , this margin is reduced to 15 months .
however , this funding gap must also be closed , demanding Steffen Krach , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Student Works Agency .
students should get Bafög immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should give Islam the same rights as the churches , and develop the existing state church law into a new state @-@ religious relationship .
it would also be important to set up an Islamic Welfare Association , which deals professionally with the newcomers .
rights also include duties .
for example , Islam &apos;s representatives must agree on clear contact points and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give it some control .
this includes a willingness to take heed of religious fundamentalism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , Aiman Mazyek , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to overcome such conflicts in Germany &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said on Bayran radio .
he suggested translating the basic law to Arabic .
integration will be much more than it is today .
this will also have to change the majority society , reducing discrimination and racism will become more pressing .
Germany , as a result of European decisions , has for a short decade an anti @-@ discrimination body and a general equality law .
but it learns very slowly , as the NSU murder series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have been demanding for a long time , and what international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention impose on Germany , must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens &apos; opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical assistance to the refugees expected to date , according to medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
&quot; as far as man- power and capacity is concerned , we are creating that , &quot; he told the daytime crowd .
however , additional money has to go into the system .
to avoid bottlenecks , Montgomery is asking all residents to hand out health cards immediately when registering .
services delivered could later be settled with the federal states .
and , in the long term , it is highly questionable to divide so many people with the limited range of services provided by the Asylum Protection Agency Act .
otherwise , doctors mainly make language barriers .
so far , the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated , migrants are getting worse informed about their illnesses than other patients .
it is not only in clinics , but also in medical practice that interpretation costs should be borne out .
but it would also help many refugees with more general medical contact points in emergency ambulances .
and with another diagnostic look .
among refugee children , for example , there are significantly more untreated disabilities , and young people are concerned about HIV education .
however , German doctors , in some cases other than those in the disease , are clearly aware of their training , according to Montgomery .
&quot; parasites or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect , &quot; and as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned , refugees may even see relief in sight .
the Syrians have a highly developed education system , and many refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and perhaps carry out checks again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill , according to the Federal Psychiatric Therapy Council ( BPtK ) estimates : most suffer from post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Munz , President of BPtK .
a recent study by TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children are traumatised in Germany .
those who are ill with post @-@ traumatic stress disorder suffer from , among other things , so @-@ called flashbacks with breathing , dizziness , heart rases and death fears .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong horror and emotional deafness .
to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , Munz explained .
so far , however , only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy .
although psychologically ill asylum seekers in social offices can apply for psychotherapy , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social departments , most of the staff or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether or not therapy is necessary .
this often leads to misassessments , says Munz .
mansions invite you to dream
with the new &quot; passion &quot; staging , the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art .
the goal is to draw every age group into the band of fascinating acrobatics , animal dresses and one @-@ time entertainment .
now the Circus Probst invites you to dream into the mansions on the brick wall .
&quot; our passion is circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Stephanie Probst , Tierlehrer and Juniorchefin .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is current maneuvering .
for more than 33 years the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family .
the gift to inspire the family is therefore in blood .
&quot; it &apos;s important to us to get people away from their everyday stream and get them involved in a completely different world for two hours , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior .
&quot; mane cocktail with world @-@ class flair , &quot; Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept .
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 km tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with joke and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent films , it wants to loosely record the Cuban duo .
ease and agility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humorous art at the Mast is to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous salmon salves , Circus Probst &apos;s acrobatics also fascinates with fingertips and joints .
balancing with one wheel on a ball ?
for He Yuan no problem .
snake menus fascinate and scare at the same time .
Wang Lin of China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinated with its agility .
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; notes Stephanies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Probst .
abuses in circadian attitudes are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations .
Stephanie Probst also takes a position on this : &quot; don &apos;t do our animals well , don &apos;t do us well either . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
the &quot; four @-@ legged artistes , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be expelled from the eyes if possible .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal doesn &apos;t feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the mansions either .
so the supreme imperative : good for the animals .
especially on her Zebroid Jumbo , a mixture of a Shetland ponydog and a zebrastute , the Probst family is proud .
the two animals have lived together eight years in a walking room and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jumbo was there , &quot; Brigitte told Probst .
the Zebroid is not yet ready for the mansions , but it is the unique mascot of Circus Probst .
so for every visitor , something should be there .
&quot; one thing is safe , &quot; Stephanie Probst says : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and are with full heart . &quot;
the Circus Probst invites you to its performances from 17 to 20 September every day .
on Sunday , the program begins at 11 a.m. and 16 p.m.
Thursday is family day , for the show at 5 p.m. , prices are reduced .
there is also a daily pool open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mugabe makes false speech in parliament
MR Mugabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell from a podium down the stairs earlier this year .
he remained uninjured , but video of the case spread quickly through the social media .
the opening of parliament was also clouded by allegations by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mugabe &apos;s address with a book .
last month they busted him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated Tuesday .
the spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their cell phones , which they warned would disrupt Mr. Mugabe &apos;s address .
&quot; the news comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he told journalists after Mugabe &apos;s speech .
it warns the MPs concerned that immunity will end in parliament , and once they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective .
the chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers to politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split into two listed companies later this year , separating the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing corporate hardware and services business .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; these restructuring measures will allow for a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Meg Whitman , HP &apos;s chairman and chief executive , who is to head the unit after the separation .

FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must be behind injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and , if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and , given his history , his involvement in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wilshere had finished strongly last season after a separate ankle injury and then found back to his old swing during pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury doesn &apos;t threaten the career , &quot; Wenger said .
it &apos;s a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not related to his ankles or to the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but , as Wenger also acknowledged , there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the inquiry into Premier Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different illnesses from Wilshere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 157 league games in the last five games .
the broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle , but Arsenal believe an improvement in the injury rate will continue during last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; Wenger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabilizes , I &apos;m confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
arsenal begin their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the Games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday , and Wenger faces a rotation within the team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start .
Wenger can also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott .
&quot; I &apos;m trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a small breather , &quot; Wenger said .
although Arsenal are clear favourites to move forward through Group F , the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most intimidating venues in Europe .
Dynamo is also undefeated after 41 games after the &quot; unbeaten &quot; campaign started last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with 3.2 measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wenger believes Arsenal have drawn the lesson from last season &apos;s Champions League surrender against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wenger said .
it has never folded at Arsenal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dreamers .
FriendsFest : the comedy show giving us serious lessons about men &apos;s friendships
the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common among men than among women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign announced Against Living Miserable ( CALM - campaign against a pathetic life ) in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challenge .
a recent study by more than 2,000 high school students with depressed symptoms found that if the suffering had a enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work .
in the age of social media @-@ led communication , with its focus on style about substance , the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrinsically values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained , money really can &apos;t buy luck .
the nice thing about Friends was that this focus was put on its head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which shines through interaction as a friend .
the humor of Joey and Chandler &apos;s frequent hugs , moments at football gusts in cosy armchairs and the yearning of Ross to Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it , even if they often hold back , fully explore their feelings .
as one member of the telephone crew explained to me , ... &quot; my audience role for people who feel depressed and are suicidal has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
the old saying &quot; I &apos;m right to say &quot; has a huge impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer @-@ term redress mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friendships .
so much my objective outsider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so when you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
di Maria meets to help PSG dismantle Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö .
di Maria meets in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG preach to Malmö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Malmö at Prinzenpark Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria hit less than four minutes after starting his Champions League debut as a PSG player who launched the French champions , but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally raising their lead when Cavani scored a headball in the 61st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions as they aim not only for qualifying for the K.o.laps but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns .
however , while they had the points , it was not a small game of Laurent Blancs &apos;s team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances before the goal , he was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career as early as 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League ... so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 @-@ 0 , cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things we still have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret we didn &apos;t score one or two more goals . &quot;
Ibrahimovic returned after being injured in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could hold a 2 @-@ 2 draw at home to Bordeaux in the First League at the weekend , but he was stripped out by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argentine wing striker was described as the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month , and he hinted at why when he ran into Marco Verrattis &apos;s pass behind the Malmö defence before walking past Johan Wiland beautifully into the corner of the net .
however , if anyone believed PSG would score a big win , that was disappointed .
Malmö , who beat Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach that stage , joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the midfield upset a heavy opponent .
but except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic , who passed far past Kevin Trapps posts in the 34th minute , they offered little in attack .
instead , PSG itself sometimes gave up , with some mishaps and poor qualifications , not least from Ibrahimovic , who patched at no less than five tries in the first half alone and then abandoned it after Cavani used it after the restart .
even so , he did much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic , which Di Maria turned into a shot that was diverted from Wiland in the 52nd minute ...
the second goal finally fell just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani , the Uruguayan scored his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic fished a left flank from Maxwell .
that ended all the thought that Malmö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz , could keep the final result low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi recognized a goal at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Hareide , later admitted that PSG played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then we &apos;ve only played in the Swedish league , which doesn &apos;t have the same level .
the skills games are not enough . &quot;
hat ab vor Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Glencore collects $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
the Swiss @-@ based mining giant Glencore , which is affected by falling commodity prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt @-@ to @-@ GDP plan .
London @-@ based Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay off its own debt .
the company , which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices as China &apos;s economic downturn squeezes demand and has a devastating impact on markets .
the issuance of reference rights brought Glencore &apos;s share price at trading early Wednesday morning a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange .
the stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index , which opened 0.69 percent higher .
Glencore last week announced the $ 2.5 billion share sale as part of broader plans to pay off about a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new holdings to 125 pence per share , which represented a 2.4 @-@ percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group .
concerns about long @-@ term constrained growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 per cent .

the White House confirms Xi Jinpings visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in a statement Tuesday .
the visit , Xi &apos;s first official in Washington , will take place on September 25 and reciprocate President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , the statement said .
the US president and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks .
&quot; President Xi &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to expand American @-@ Chinese cooperation on a range of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively , &quot; the statement adds .
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before moving to New York City to the U.N. General Assembly in September .
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of contentious issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns about China &apos;s alleged cyberespionage and its growing self @-@ awareness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea .

Xavi : PEP Guardiola prevented 2008 move to FC Bayern
world and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al @-@ Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern were obviously close to the commitment of Spain &apos;s superstar Xavi , who played for FC Barcelona at the time .
eight times Spanish champions , three times postseason winners , four times Champions League winners , two times club champions , two times European champions , one time world champions - Xavi &apos;s title list is staggering .
in summer , the now 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ Sadd Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Marca , Xavi now reveals that he was already ahead of Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona .
&quot; you told me that Barça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything at the time , we nothing , &quot; he told me .
and that also registered FC Bayern .
Xavi : &quot; there was an offer from Bayern . &quot;
&quot; Rummenigge wanted me to have . &quot;
as a reminder , Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern in the summer of 2008 .
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn &apos;t change
however , the change did not materialise .
and today the decisive man works for the German record master : PEP Guardiola .
Xavi explains why : &quot; Barça got Guardiola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; PEP told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot;
&quot; with that , he cried me . &quot;
who knows how Bayerns would have run Xavi &apos;s 2008 / 2009 season .
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarterfinals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the turf , switched the Red forward ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end of the premier triumph .
Matt Damon plays down diversity in film creation
Matt Damon confronted African @-@ American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not required behind the scenes .
during a episode of Sunday Night of HBOs Project GreenLight , experienced actor Brown broke down when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives , referring to a black protagonists in the project &apos;s chosen script .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , you do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; Damon assured .
brown reacted shocked , with insulting disbelief and called &quot; Hoo ! WoW . &quot; okay , &quot; when The Martian &apos;s comments rallied .
Damon and Brown joined producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show &apos;s finalists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever the director will be - how they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown said initially .
the only black person , and she is a nutty beaten by her white pimp .
the producer of Dear White People campaigned for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for directing rights to the film ; Damon replied that her directing &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion aired , the social media exploded from disapproval of Damon &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Pooni crushed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her diversity - that &apos;s SO WEISS that hurts it . &quot;
the tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 Likes since its release .
Damon &apos;s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate .
after the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014 , the Black Lives Matter movement achieved nationwide effect and urged lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against farmers .
in February , singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards .
&quot; album still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group should be considered a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Lives Matter is a love group , &quot; the leaders said .
it was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers , producers and media mogule invited to visit the pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the pope is unclear .
&apos;American Ninja Warrior &apos; crowned first champion
professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the grand prize of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just closed its 7th season , had never seen a competition participant complete all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season finale , two men , Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten , managed to reach the final .
the last task was to climb a 75 @-@ foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Britten finished the task within time , making him the first athlete to complete the exhausting Phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior , but Caldiero finished that challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Caldiero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won win , still under shock over winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; Isaac E said ! about his pile of money .
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t get any prize money .
under the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one finalist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; Weed said .
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it gets the great congratulations .
I don &apos;t think he has any grudge about it .
he &apos;s just so happy to have done what he did .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he &apos;s such a great guy and a family friend .
he is a hero to his children and his wife .
Geoff said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad it &apos;s Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had swapped the roles .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an Eighth season , the shooting will begin in the spring of 2016 .
Detroit Tigers grind past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers .
they used to be one of the best teams in baseball , today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central .
the Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers , but played that part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5 @-@ 4 at Target Field .
the Twins wasted a chance to climb within a playoff of the Houston Astros for second American League wild @-@ card place .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so difficult to capture over much of the second half of the season .
&quot; all the victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said .
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck out 6 times in the 1 / 3 innings and allowed three Runs .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish strongly this year , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bullpen every game and so I want to go into the game quite focused .
the designated Tigers hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two Runs , his first RBIs since mid @-@ August .
it was Martinez &apos;s first three @-@ hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6 .
&quot; he did the stroke well , &quot; Ausmus said .
he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , looked significantly better off in the bullpen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three Runs in the back of the seventh innings , the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game .
center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the Inning with a double on the left field line .
right fielder Aaron Hicks hit a bunt , and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left @-@ hander Blaine Hardy .
Hardy overran Wall , the only man he faced , before presumptive rookie batter Miguel Sano , who tore off right @-@ hander Drew Verhagen a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the final run at the second , Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a Double Play .
it was this in Major League leading 27th time this season that Plouffe beat a Double Play
after Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth innings , Wall created an RBI double against the Closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ hander , however , stole Sano at three pitches for his fifth save .
Detroit benefited to kick @-@ start the game from an unmoving Phil Hughes .
the Tigers scored three Runs in the first two innings against the right @-@ hander veteran , who had been removed from the injury list before the game after missing for more than a month because of a backhand .
&quot; obviously not the start I wanted , &quot; Hughes said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning . &quot;
after getting the lead @-@ off batter in the first , Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game , creating a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Martinez made his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in scoring position .
third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right , creating another run , but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to third , ending the threat .
the Tigers put in the second , scoring a one @-@ out double from catcher James McCann and a Two @-@ Out single from center @-@ fielder Anthony Gose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; Twins manager Paul Molitor said .
he didn &apos;t score particularly well , but he caught the right spot .
Hughes was in a pitch count , scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by reliever right @-@ hander A.J.Achter .
at Hughes , there were three Runs at six hits and a Walk with four strikeouts .
notes : Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez retired because of injury to the throwing shoulder .
he is being investigated by Dr James Andrews , who operated Sanchez &apos;s shoulder in 2007 .
Sanchez , on the injury list since mid @-@ August because of a shoulder strain , is expected to be activated for the start Wednesday .
with Sanchez out of the game , LHP Daniel Morris is scrapped from the injury list to start against the Twins .
Norris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
he has been missing since August 20 because of a crush in the right hip .
the Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris ( 2 @-@ 2.4.43 ERA ) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.73 )
hundreds of refugees to fall in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who travelled there will then be housed in shelters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden reported Tuesday night .
it estimated between 450 and 750 refugees .
several sports halls of the province &apos;s capital had been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there .
they will then be distributed to other municipalities .
over the past ten days alone , 7500 people had arrived in Hessen , according to the government &apos;s Board of Directors responsible for initial recording .
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in Sporthalle because of the large number of refugees .
Ischinger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Ischinger , considers military action with German involvement in Syria a possibility .
&quot; I think the determined reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said .
he accused the European states of &quot; collective viewing . &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the Kelch had passed a military stake in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict is landing on our doorstep , &quot; he said in German radio .
the former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Minister for the Interior Johanna Mikl @-@ Leitner said on Tuesday evening on the Austrian television channel ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany also did not return refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; she explained .
on the question of an agreement under which Germany could host a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mikl @-@ Leitner said there had already been discussions on this between the Director @-@ General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not mention specific figures and pointed to talks Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit next week .
Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday .
EU countries have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
EU Home Affairs Ministers intend to take a new approach to the mandatory distribution of a further 120 000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee vessel in Germany , the federal government wants to give more support to countries in the initial reception and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced late Tuesday night after almost four @-@ month consultations with the prime ministers at the chancellor &apos;s office in Berlin .
Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection also complained .
but those who do not have a lead perspective cannot remain in Germany .
this view was strongly shared in the round .
the Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania would also disappear with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from seeking escape routes over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were initial arrests of people who had average the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , eyewitness reports showed thousands more migrants heading to the Greek border .
spacecraft &apos; Cassini &apos; finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
under the ice panzer of Saturday &apos;s Enceladus swung a global ocean .
that includes researchers from observations of the spacecraft &quot; Cassini . &quot;
so the moon flies easily on its railways around the ring planets .
although this exchange movement is small , it is still too large for an all @-@ too @-@ strong celestial body , according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca ( US State of New York ) Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; Icarus . &quot;
it has been known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus .
&quot; Cassini &quot; had already discovered ice volcanoes on Saturn &apos;s southern pole in 2006 , splitting water vapour and ice particles , feeding Saturn &apos;s so @-@ called E @-@ Ring .
at least on the South Pole there must be an underground sea , the astronomers closed at the time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clarified .
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
the 1860 Munich must give up about a month on offensive actor Valdet Rama .
an investigation has revealed an adductor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association said .
Rama had already complained about pain earlier this week .
according to Munich lions , the diagnosis &quot; probably means four weeks of forced leave . &quot;
&quot; that hits us hard , Rama is a herber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; Sports Director Necat Aygün told the &quot; Picture &quot; newspaper , looking at the possible commitment of a unified professional .
as a training guest , however , the 1960s first presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg .
the Kroate currently has &quot; the ability to prove his skills . &quot;
goalkeeper Rubin Okotie can return to managerial training after his brainchild next week .
on Thursday , the Austrian national player is expected to enter career training .
Okotie had been injured in the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a fierce collision at the head .
however , he remained without serious blessings .
no diet fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slim line are often more likely to get away from them .
because mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially Saccharose .
healthy are the exotic fruits anyway : in them , B vitamins , vitamins E and C. above all , Mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta cararotin .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying Mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant .
the shaft color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within days .
then , of course , they taste pure or sweet food .
but a mango also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it mitigates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chicoree and Radiccio .

the company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers , UPS said Tuesday .
drivers in particular are being sought .
as early as last year , UPS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95,000 assists .
given the booming online business , UPS and its rival FedEx have been making arrangements for Christmas business since last year .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries brought harsh criticism to package services .
first Föhnstorm , then distinctive cold front
next night , in the valleys of the Föhn Alps side , Meteoschweiz reported Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night of Thursday , the Föhn blows in part with storm strength by the female offenders .
after finishing on Thursday morning , we cross a striking cold front that brings strong rain , wind gusts and a drop in temperature .
as MeteoNews writes in a note , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Isles in a powerful southwest stream .
on the Alpine side , on the night of Wednesday the Föhn breaks through the valleys .
as a result , the Föhn blossoms blossoms with embroidery from 60 to 100 km / h , and especially in the Urnerland partly with over 100 km / h .
the Föhn can penetrate in places to the adjacent centre , and in the mountains there are even orchards of over 120 km / h .
while in the north on Wednesday , stormy fingers provide summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture starts to dust on the Alpine slope .
this is where rain takes hold until Thursday night .
in sum , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , there will have to be more than 100 litres of rain per square metre , having fallen in recent days .
on Thursday morning , the Föhn takes off the air , in the wake of a cold front with strong , partially trite rain from West to East over Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind is fresh strongly to stormy , and temperatures are falling significantly .
the following days are presented in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , while in the south it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
just over 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ignazio Marino , a previously nameless place in the park on the Oppio Hill was baptized on the name of the German reformist .
in Piazza Martin Lutero , he is now recognized as a German theologian of Reformation .
the park is located in the middle of old Rome next to the Coliseum .
the name was requested by the working community of evangelical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kruse , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome , recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of popes over centuries as a minority could often live only in secret .
the place symbolises the fact that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 1483 @-@ 1546 ) held a few months in Rome as a young Augustine monster .
he then felt the city was a deserted scapegoat .
his negative impressions should have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then launched the split of the absentee church with his theses against the Ablashandel .
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gilded ) village crone is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
no , not at the Otmar @-@ Alt Bible , which has now appeared with magnificent images .
at the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt , who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imaginative shapes has been preserved by the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means synonymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary , it can be quite bleak to adapt to the issues concerned .
about three years Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many themes of the book of all books .
cycles have emerged that address issues such as crossroads , pads , bids or fatherhood .
he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and here is the author Klaus Altepost , who has dealt with the respective Bible points on the basis of the painting .
he has interpreted the books selected by Otmar Alt and thus &quot; translated &quot; into current contexts .
these lyrics are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible citation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulates his own personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry band has golden letters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Otmar Alt , born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler Order .
&quot; this is where education happened with the cane , &quot; Otmar Alt recalls .
&quot; I tried to work that up to maybe wear myself back with the Lord Father . &quot;
his second concern is to give more prominence to art in a fast @-@ paced period : &quot; the perception of images today is characterized by reclamation , and that is loud .
symbolism is being pushed out .
artists have a different desire and Wonne to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I &apos;m a dinosaur . &quot;
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; fall into the pictures , &quot; let them work , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image seeks its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Altepost acknowledged Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar @-@ Alt Bible in the Otmar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Otmar Alts art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old did not pay attention to fully capturing the Bible , but selected the issues important to him , including mysterious ones .
&quot; this was not a collaboration on an equal footing , &quot; Altepost says : &quot; this is about the images , the text only explained , &quot; a picture Bible emerged .
for Hans Möhler of the Luther publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; deepen his life and find freedom . &quot;
Otmar Alts pictures speak for Möhler both the ( biblical ) language of love and that of responsibility .
part of the original - paper and quality images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on 15 November at the Otmar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction beginning for BMX train approaching
plans were made , space found , companies instructed to model Earth &apos;s hail for a round course : a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX train was finished .
failures in politics and administration caused distress , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the train .
so hills cut down , new space sought - now with formal planning and application for construction permission .
the approval will be received in October , the first local councillor Sabine Mosebach @-@ Bock could now report to the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; she said .
work on the former indoor swimming pool should be started without &quot; further remembrance . &quot;
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
the DFB expands its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundesliga is sending a clear signal at the weekend .
football is responding to the worsening situation in Germany and ensures that the policy will help to address the challenges ahead .
&quot; I consider this to be our country &apos;s biggest challenge since reunification . &quot;
&quot; there , in principle , no one can say this is not about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to be of interest to each individual to get this issue under control , &quot; DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach said .
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany in depth .
&quot; I am in the chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the state minister Ms Özoğuz and the Chancellor there . &quot;
&quot; there will certainly be a central role to play , &quot; he announced .
football can and will help .
however , the crucial points must be the policy .
the German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 @-@ 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; through the Egidius Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; said Niersbach , on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal experts also support this program .
as early as this weekend , the 36 professional clubs are setting a clear mark when they will wear the &quot; We Help - # refugeeswelcome &quot; on the left , instead of the usual sponsorship logo ( Hermes ) .
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; Leverkusens Sports Chief Rudi Völler told the Bild newspaper ( Tuesday ) , calling the project &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , no one is allowed to walk away . &quot;
&quot; we football league players can , no , we need to use our blast , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; Hertha manager Michael Preetz said .
Hoffenheim &apos;s managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Hall / Saale for the Euro qualifying match against Hungary this Friday .
Niersbach called the support of refugees &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
the fact that all 36 licensing clubs had started their own projects in their places is great .
it is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active .
the message &quot; 1 @-@ 0 for a welcome &quot; we spent is being lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year and next year , the Association , together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government , provides EUR 300 000 each for the integration of refugees .
&quot; clubs have already retrieved the full amount for 2015 , &quot; Niersbach reported .
reports : SAP chief executive loses an eye in accident
according to several reports , the chief executive of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill McDermott , lost the left eye by a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the US , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he &apos;s almost faded , was powerless , then tossed out onto the street - he told us so last week , &quot; the WiWo quoted SAP co @-@ founder Hasso Plattner .
McDermott , however , could follow his work .
&quot; in early October , we meet before the supervisory board meeting in Walldorf , &quot; Plattner said .
the 54 year @-@ old manager is in the meeting and &quot; fully operational . &quot;
McDermott announced in an interview with the South German newspaper ( Thursday &apos;s edition ) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP there , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner , &quot; McDermott told the SZ .
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the US , but he hasn &apos;t been at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf since the summer .
it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; SZ &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen like this . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s important to stand up again when you &apos;ve fallen . &quot;

football : BvB without Reus against Krasnodar : Weidenfeller in goal
at Borussia Dortmund , all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally crumbled .
the national player will also miss the league &apos;s table leader in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t resort to him , unfortunately , &quot; Thomas Tuchel said Wednesday .
whether Reus will be back in Sunday &apos;s Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen left the BVB coach open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
given the heavy burden of his pros , Tuchel will not only change his pedigree on the reality position .
so he announced a change on the goalkeeper position .
this is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regulars Roman Bürki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
whether Weidenfeller will be deployed in all Europa League games in the future , however , Tuchel left open .
he will probably also contest the second match .
the forensic statement from co @-@ player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal , considers midfielder Julian Weigl to be understandable : &quot; this is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to take off the title . &quot;
robot cars : government wants lead for Germany
Germany is said to be technological pioneers in changing the car , according to the wishes of the federal government .
the Federal Cabinet on Wednesday approved a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure .
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA auto show about a &quot; new mobility age . &quot;
automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and provide less congestion , Dobrindt said .
he also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries , who are also meeting industry representatives at the IAA .
the transport ministry &apos;s strategy paper stresses , among other things , the importance of mobile broadband and a rapid shift to digital radio .
in order to test new technology , a test track is currently being created on Highway 9 in Bavaria .
in order to ensure that the driver &quot; does not incur additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
for example , Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permitted speed for self @-@ driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres .
the Federal Government also wants to promote a change to the Vienna Convention , which so far only provides for people as drivers .
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020 .
still , driveless vehicles on public roads &quot; are only to be expected well after 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at Germany &apos;s location estimate the study &apos;s authors for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; digital networking of the pin can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol .
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of drivers &apos; personal data must be clearly clarified .
yet Germans still see self @-@ driving cars skeptical - much more than French or American .
a survey by the Forsa Institute on Wednesday on behalf of the audit firm Dekra concludes that only eight per cent of Germans believe that autonom @-@ driven cars will prevail over the next decade , 32 per cent expect only in 20 years , 31 per cent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respondents expect autonom @-@ driven cars by 2025 , 33 percent in the US .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
according to a survey by the digital association Bitkom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the journey on all roads .
on the highway , that could still be 15 percent in flowing traffic , 45 percent in congestion .
well every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Boll says team and double start at table tennis EM
the Dusseldorfer only wants to put up in a single position in the title fight from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision is due to be taken on 22 September at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; however , we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf said during the EM course in Düsseldorf .
Boll was on the flight for a long @-@ term sponsorship date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is we are no longer such a clear favorite now , &quot; said Einzel European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov .
the Hamelner , who leads the Setzlist in Jekaterinburg , but also recalled Euro 2013 in Schwechat .
&quot; at the time , Timo also lacked , and we have become European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should be guided by this , &quot; explained the world &apos;s fifth .

Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible
it &apos;s a mix of very large fashion shows and a wax @-@ figure grass cabinet : designer Jean Paul Gaultier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : storefront dolls that look terribly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Madrid &apos;s stage outfits - and by putting men in skirts .
&quot; I can &apos;t say today that I &apos;m the Enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be colourful , now it &apos;s real , &quot; Gaultier said .
for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk &quot; ( From the pavement ) , which can be seen from 18 September at the Kunsthalle der Hypo @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion master has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person .
actually , he was against it because , &quot; For me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsthalle , Roger Dieders .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely overlooked work of the man who has written fashion history without ever completing an education .
chronologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent choreographed overall artwork for which much effort has been made : to freeze the dolls , for example , a stylist has been specially engaged .
14 tonnes of material have carved the makers to Munich , according to the curator Thierry @-@ Maxime Loriot .
just before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special Schmankerl : a leather hose outfit with corset .
Heidi meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smarter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaultier said .
Gaultier &apos;s old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the designer &apos;s first , tentative fashionable walking attempts .
as a child ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Teddy BHs and clothes , Gaultier said .
playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents to .
he later taught himself to dismiss fashion .
he stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gaultier told in Munich .
later I bought them of course .
for his first own fashion show , he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they had nothing but were allowed to keep the clams .
jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener tip as fashion niche
it used to be the long nitrogen machines in and around Plauen to make yards .
the embroidered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers who , for example , continued to work on blankets and curtains .
this is no longer working today , explains Andreas Reinhardt , managing director of Modespitze Plauen .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early days of the Plauener tip , fashion played a bigger role , then was pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche .
Reinhardt gives some examples : top in jewellery , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which opposes past bulletins , is a growing order potential .
anyone who does not use niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
we already make up half of all orders .
Modespitze Plauen , along with nine other companies , is a member of the industry association Plauener Top and Stickerei .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the past 15 years , about 80 percent of sales have broken away .
private specialty stores and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach customers by this way .
the bulk goods are now produced much cheaper in Asia and are distributed almost exclusively through chains .
moreover , exports are weakening , currently to Russia and the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association is also trying to score by environmental awareness , as Cordula Bauer explains from the Stickperle in Falkenstein : &quot; since this year we have been leading a quality label that shows that we produce environmentally and socially tolerated . &quot;
Reinhardt added : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Ausstelle of the Westsächsische Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and tips .
in order to counter competition from the Asian region , we need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that takes time and courage .
there is a tension between the designer &apos;s freshest ideas and the businesses that need to think primarily economically , &quot; Schmidt says .
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snow tip .
in some places , the machine stifles small kitchens .
the Plauener Goldschmiedemeister Bianca Hallebach @-@ Kraucht was inspired by this : &quot; before that I couldn &apos;t start with traditional Plauener tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; a lot of people in the region identify with the issue of Plauener tip - young and old , &quot; Reuter says .
it also supplies to the US , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a memorial .
I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener tip .
Disney plans new &apos; Mary Poppins &apos; movie
legends should not be stirred , but Disney still dares to make a new film of its classic &quot; Mary Poppins . &quot;
however , according to Entertainment Weekly , this is not a refilm , but a kind of sequel that plays with the magical nanny 20 years after the first film .
it &apos;s about the experiences of the nanny with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
anyone who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear .
but the director already stands firm : Rob Marshall , most recently with &quot; Into the Woods &quot; in the cinema .
XI urges to open the economy wider for the world
the economy needs to open wider to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jinping said Tuesday of a group charged with steering reform .
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leader Group for deepening comprehensive reform .
promoting new start @-@ ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , Xi said .
the governing group has adopted a number of directives , including a negative list on market access rules , relaxation of border control policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SOE ) , private capital , and overhaul of the population reporting system .
according to the statement , a negative list is being drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legal business environment and makes the market more open , the statement said .
the government will also ease controls on the powers conferred on businesses and ensure companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
other areas of private investment will be opened up as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors .
&quot; the government will not change its policy toward foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services to them , &quot; the statement said .
in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits or the Green Card by optimising requirements and facilitating the application process .
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also included Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli , as reported in a statement released after the meeting .
EU seeks to double mercury limit value in predators
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predators , thereby encouraging consumers to have a much higher dose of nervous energy .
the Foodwatch consumer organisation , which has a working paper from the EU , strongly criticised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant women and young children , &quot; said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch .
according to Wolfschmidt , the limit values of nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shark or swordfish , are to be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , large predators are already so heavily burdened with mercury that around 50 % of catches cannot be sold on the basis of the remaining limit values .
after doubling the limit values , only 14.5 % would be irretrievable .
in return for this easing , according to Foodwatch , the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram .
Foodwatch , however , called this a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller graveyards , such as carp , are usually so low that they are already complying with the planned highs today .
thus , the reduction in cloning is &quot; a perfidious distraction that helps the economy alone , &quot; Wolfschmidt explained .
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans , which is highly enriched by the food chain , especially in predators .
the federal government therefore warns that &quot; already low levels of damage to the nervous system &quot; can cause .
however , the Federal Ministry of the Environment states on its homepage that there is no risk to public health .
mercury comes into the environment mainly through coal incineration .
according to a written statement from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , Germany &apos;s coal @-@ fired power plants are producing more than six tonnes of mercury a year , two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for example , in Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; permanently and nationally exceeded , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted from the paper in March .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU &apos;s RASFF alert system .
Foodwatch calls on consumers to protest against the EU &apos;s plans at : www.mercury @-@ action.foodwatch.de
