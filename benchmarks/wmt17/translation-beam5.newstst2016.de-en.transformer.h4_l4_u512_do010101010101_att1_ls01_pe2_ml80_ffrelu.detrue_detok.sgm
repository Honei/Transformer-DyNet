<seg id="2">The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilising actions in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the meeting will also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution under discussion.</seg>
<seg id="5">The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Washington criticises Israel's ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Obama deal on Iran's nuclear program has further worsened the relationship between the two.</seg>
<seg id="8">In March, at the invitation of the Republicans to the US Congress, Netanyahu made a controversial speech, which was seen as an affront to Obama.</seg>
<seg id="9">The speech was not agreed with Obama, but a meeting with reference to the forthcoming Israeli election.</seg>

<seg id="1">In an emergency call, Professor admitted to have shot his girlfriend</seg>
<seg id="2">In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials had to come to his house.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" is still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Within the House, the officials found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note clinging to a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted to go back, I loved Amy and she was the only woman who ever loved me."</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular historian, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.</seg>
<seg id="6">Delta State University Polizeief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that Lamb made the disastrous emergency call at some point.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamm took his life when the police joined him.</seg>
<seg id="9">One day after the shooting in the university, which forced students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to find out what motivated Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="10">The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him, helped to draw an image of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.</seg>
<seg id="12">The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said that he had no history of violence or criminal history.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty comprises 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, there were some inclinations about problematic behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="16">A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said that he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."</seg>
<seg id="17">Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of 2014-15 academic year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for an assessment for health reasons, saying that he had any health problem.</seg>
<seg id="19">This year he taught only two online courses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic way to recruit as assistant professor.</seg>
<seg id="21">University President William LaForge said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's presentation."</seg>
<seg id="22">These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.</seg>
<seg id="23">After fleeing the campus, the police later found Lambs' trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house, about one mile south of his parent house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="25">His car was still in the entrance.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lamb grew up in the area.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.</seg>
<seg id="29">He received his doctorate in education in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of Lambs' longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.</seg>
<seg id="31">Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when they met with friends.</seg>
<seg id="32">They and their friends were in the High School, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her the guitar.</seg>
<seg id="33">He was then the women's swarm.</seg>
<seg id="34">All girls melted when he was there, "said Hairston, now 40 and live in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lamb and Prentiss obviously had some time together.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the emergency call Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.</seg>
<seg id="37">They had a dog called Lightning who lived with them in the brick house that borders on a Bayou in Gautier.</seg>
<seg id="38">The police said that the dog was in order.</seg>
<seg id="39">The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She was completely destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">She and her mother were absolutely best friends.</seg>
<seg id="42">O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer market three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="44">Later they played together one or two gigs.</seg>
<seg id="45">O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mike Shaffer, a Barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weak illuminated bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night in the night of September 5, for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouthharmonic game before a poor audience.</seg>
<seg id="48">There were no signs that anything was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Simply a happy couple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="50">We were on the clearing up and shattered each other.</seg>
<seg id="51">I think they both had a good sense of jokes.</seg>
<seg id="52">Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was married and had three young children.</seg>
<seg id="54">He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brother and student committee.</seg>
<seg id="55">At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening about 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community participated in a candle-lit commemorative ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="56">Schmidts Ms. Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Warrant, while the University Choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.</seg>
<seg id="57">Lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We try to persuade our students to return," said LaForge.</seg>
<seg id="59">The crisis is over.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is a day of healing.</seg>
<seg id="61">Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="62">Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.</seg>
<seg id="63">This story has been corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after having shot Schmidt, and that Lamm, in his emergency call Prentiss, described Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 surveys showing that Donald Trump is serious.</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to brand him as a flop.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others have dismissed him as a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some are waiting for collapse.</seg>
<seg id="5">But, no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from top ranks in polls, it has (still) not worked.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Trump in two-digit terms, and some are beginning to wonder seriously what it means for the chances of nominating real estate moguls.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it is still too early in the parliamentary term.</seg>
<seg id="8">No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts stress that Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain in 2011, none of which won even one state in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outsiders, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC, and the conservative Club for Growth economic group, now recognize Trump's perseverance and begin to channel their dollars to overthrow him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some current survey figures indicating that real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump's popularity has turned 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.</seg>
<seg id="15">By mid-July it was 40%.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of August it was 52%.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="19">And these figures are in early states.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60% of Republicans have a good view of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a poll by CNN / ORC last week, 67% of Republicans said that they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two out of 10 say they would be "angry" if he were the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they are "enthusiastic" about Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">Next in terms of enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, became a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="28">A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52% of Irish voters on Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same number is true in the nation's first pre-election state, Iowa, where the same 52% of Republicans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">Nevertheless, 44% think that he does not have the personality to carry out his duties effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, according to ABC / Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters get used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">When they set up their scholars "hats, Republican voters consider Trump real.</seg>
<seg id="34">When they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a survey by CNN / ORC last week, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.</seg>
<seg id="35">This has been a change since four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to only 28% for final candidate Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yet a large number of Trump's GOP voters seem plausible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is spread across more than a dozen other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a Monmouth University poll at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-on race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump wins majority support.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate to beat him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.</seg>
<seg id="46">A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their minds.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new CBS / NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters supporting Trump say they have staked their votes.</seg>
<seg id="48">Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change the mind.</seg>
<seg id="49">46% said they would leave the door open to switch to other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">Yet Trump's strongest competitor at the moment is the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since Donald Trump called "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been the focus of public discourse on 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep critical Hispano Americans out of the Republican Party and damage the reorientation effort.</seg>
<seg id="54">But, according to Monday's new ABC / Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump seems to be doing so.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration about the government is rising to new levels.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half the support of Republican voters, especially through their outsider status.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six out of ten Republicans say in ABC / Post's new Monday poll that they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are angry with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">A survey by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, with 54% "unhappy" and 21% "polite."</seg>

<seg id="2">Two-fold goalkeepers in Piräus: Bavaria-Star Thomas Müller simply got a run.</seg>
<seg id="3">A happy match by Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern to a earned 3: 0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then ran.</seg>
<seg id="4">A sovereign start to the Champions League season.</seg>
<seg id="5">The World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the Piräus warlock.</seg>
<seg id="6">The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won their start-up in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52nd / 90th + 2) and Götzes hit (89th).</seg>
<seg id="7">The twelfth start-up of the series will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.</seg>
<seg id="8">Müller received an amicable help from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto in his 28th match in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We will not underestimate them," Bavaria captain Philipp Lahm promised hot-blooded fans before the match in the Karaiskakis stadium before 31.688 - and the Munich-based people kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed a concentrated and committed vision without shining.</seg>
<seg id="11">Piräus had won his latest six championship home games, including Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 2011 Borussia Dortmund (1: 3) also stumbled here.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Bavaria, undefeated in seven Europacup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.</seg>
<seg id="14">They bravely ran, but often too ingenuous in their offensive efforts.</seg>
<seg id="15">The attacks were too often initiated by playing on the left hand side of Douglas Costa, who rarely came across against the former ligness Omar Elabdellaoui.</seg>
<seg id="16">Müller had more luck from the right than his flank struck from the right-hand corner in the upper Toreck.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the 67th minute, the World Champion gave the possibility of 2: 0.</seg>
<seg id="18">The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.</seg>
<seg id="19">First, when Olympiakos Stürmer Ideye Brown beat the head ball of Poland from the line (26).</seg>
<seg id="20">Then by direct take, the Torwart Roberto parked with the knee (35).</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Bavaria raised its usual dominant game, Piräus could set needle-stick.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Torhüter Manuel Neuer was left.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, when he steered a shot of Ideye over the bar (56).</seg>
<seg id="24">In front of Neuer, Guardiola defended a four-wheeled chain with David Alaba in the centre next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the Kader, sat out first.</seg>
<seg id="26">The World Cup hero did not give the green light until after finishing training, Matthias Sammer said at "Sky": "Anyone who wants to make something different from it is already bad."</seg>
<seg id="27">Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman to death (59).</seg>
<seg id="28">Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, and Muller set up one by Elfmeter.</seg>
<seg id="29">Before the match, Krawallen had come to the stadium.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a smaller group of partially mummified Bavaria fans in their audience block, apparently provoked the supporters of hosts Piräus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and attacked the Munich followers.</seg>
<seg id="31">At least one Bavaria fan was injured in the stadium.</seg>

<seg id="2">If you smoke, you are not only hurting the lungs, but also teeth - that is what a Potsdamer long-term study suggests.</seg>
<seg id="3">The good news: If you do not take the risk quickly.</seg>
<seg id="4">Smokers have a much higher risk of losing teeth early.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is evident from the long-term study carried out by an international research team, including several staff members of the German Food Research Institute (DIfE) in Potsdam.</seg>
<seg id="6">Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely by the 2.5- to 3.6-fold higher.</seg>
<seg id="7">Scientists observed more than 23,300 participants.</seg>
<seg id="8">The main causes of dental failure are caries and inflammation of the gum, emphasizes the DIfE.</seg>
<seg id="9">The authors stress that smoking is a risk factor for this parodontitis.</seg>
<seg id="10">The link between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.</seg>
<seg id="12">But people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short space of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, it may take more than ten years for the risk to return to the level of non-smokers, said Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.</seg>
<seg id="14">People have to be persuaded to become non-smokers, says Heiner Boeing's DIfE study manager: "Smoking reduces life."</seg>
<seg id="15">Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, leads to good dental health up to old age.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Germany, more than 20% of the population aged 65 to 74 is affected by toothlessness, the DIfE has been informed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier studies would have pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure.</seg>
<seg id="18">The new long-term study underpins the findings.</seg>

<seg id="1">Commission proposes new General Court in dispute over TTIP</seg>
<seg id="2">To defuse the dispute over the planned Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement TTIP, the European Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.</seg>
<seg id="3">The controversial private mediation bodies for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which is much more in line with traditional courts in its operation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We want to establish a system that citizens trust," said Cecilia Malmström, Commissioner responsible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Swede intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position into the free trade talks with the US.</seg>
<seg id="6">The German Government announced support.</seg>
<seg id="7">TTIP aims to create the world's largest free trade area of 800 million people.</seg>
<seg id="8">The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU countries and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are to come from the EU, the US and third countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">It also provides for a second instance for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would allow an appeal against judgments.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, the parties involved have agreed on arbitrators, and there has been no objection to their judgments.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the debate over recent months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the long term, according to its own data, it intends to work towards an International Investment Court.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could then be resolved.</seg>
<seg id="16">The investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS), particularly required by large corporations, are considered to be one of the main reasons for Europe's strong opposition to TTIP.</seg>
<seg id="17">Traditional arbitral courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice through which companies seek compensation for taxpayers, abolish national laws, or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">In initial opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact identified the Commission's proposals as insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="19">The main criticism was that they should not apply to the already negotiated FTA with Canada (CETA).</seg>
<seg id="20">German State Secretary Matthias MACHNIG (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as major progress.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Commission takes into account key elements of the reform that the German Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, worked out with other EU Trade Ministers in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="22">The old system of private arbitrators is out of the table.</seg>
<seg id="23">The French Government also welcomed Malmström's plans.</seg>
<seg id="24">The European Business Association BusinessEurope warned against imposing too many new rules on business.</seg>
<seg id="25">This could put small and medium-sized enterprises in particular at a disadvantage.</seg>
<seg id="26">When talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) could be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="27">Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US.</seg>
<seg id="29">Originally, a framework for the agreement should be in place by the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="30">This deadline is deemed to be no longer tenable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg</seg>
<seg id="2">Eleven years ago Sufjan Stevens is sitting on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).</seg>
<seg id="3">Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy followers recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with film pen.</seg>
<seg id="4">The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.</seg>
<seg id="5">He tells from various places he keeps recording on the map, about which his minuciously and tender arranged songs report.</seg>
<seg id="6">Where they were born and what it looks like in his homeland.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since then Stevens has proved to be a wonderfully creative Irish.</seg>
<seg id="8">With the release and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" released in 2003, cleverly composed songs appear, which are harmoniously very close to American folks of the late 1960s, but can drift at any time into a great opulent.</seg>
<seg id="9">The rumour arises that "Michigan" is the first part of a misguided series: Each of the 50 states of the United States should be occupied in a row.</seg>
<seg id="10">But already in 2004 and close to the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared, breaking down certain expectations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Reduced Stevens appears here.</seg>
<seg id="12">Live suffice to him guitar and banjo.</seg>
<seg id="13">A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.</seg>
<seg id="14">With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), an extensive masterpiece is published in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="15">An abundance of ideas and stylistic finesse.</seg>
<seg id="16">The album rises into the American Billboard charts and is not missing in the annual list of influential music media.</seg>
<seg id="17">After extremely productive experiments Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic parts.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and Hall.</seg>
<seg id="19">For a long time, the stage shows will become the colorful spectacle of neon forehead bands and a big fluorescent stage crowd.</seg>
<seg id="20">Currently tourt Sufjan Stevens as part of a five-headed band through Germany.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the dark Hamburg More!</seg>
<seg id="22">He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although there are now almost 2000 guests sitting in their chairs, the much more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folklore.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without sending a word to the audience, the group plays excellent musicians through the wide-ranging album.</seg>
<seg id="25">We hear from the audience that the talk is "more opulent" and that it is possible to throw away the "record."</seg>
<seg id="26">Steven's humble attitude is due to the fact that he plays very few older songs, and finally refuses to listen to them.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jeremy Corbyns Debüt at Question Time to the Prime Minister</seg>
<seg id="2">Since his election, Mr Corbyns has been eagerly awaited at the Prime Minister's Question Time</seg>
<seg id="3">The new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is to give his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and for the first time engage with David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">MR Corbyn will rise to ask the first of its six questions shortly after noon, with its performance likely to be examined by the media and Labour MEPs from nearby.</seg>
<seg id="5">He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination of Mr Corbyn's leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the meantime, the Labour Chairman's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the fall of national anthem during a commemorative celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the centre of several front page stories in newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="9">MR Corbyn's decision not to sing national anthem has attracted attention</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman from Mr Corbyn said that he had "stood in contemptuous silence" and he recognised the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air slaughter around England."</seg>
<seg id="11">But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two Newsnight program that he had advised Labour Chairman to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, invoking differences in economics, defense, and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leaders.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BBC's Political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences also "stack" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's statement about the position on the European Union and limiting profits.</seg>
<seg id="14">MR Corbyn said to the TUC conference that Labour is making changes to remove the whole idea of limiting overall.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hours later, Mr Smith, shadow labour and pensions minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">MR Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to confront David Cameron over the past decade, since he was Tory's chief executive, over the Dispatch Box in Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Labour leader, who promised a different policy approach, says that he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both "toughness" and the fight with resistance, and instead plan to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">MR Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economist, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, when Mr Cameron is abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has also raised the idea that other colleagues may occasionally take the floor and that he raised John Bercow, the spokesman for the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.</seg>
<seg id="21">When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from the politics of a Kasperle Theatre, often linked to Prime Minister Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.</seg>
<seg id="22">As it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the main barometer of a leader's judgment and leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his fellow Members, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.</seg>

<seg id="4">This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and has been calculated on the timing of an increase in interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="5">The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up to 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.</seg>
<seg id="7">SABMiller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20% after the acquisition of Rivalen AB InBev.</seg>
<seg id="8">A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.</seg>

<seg id="9">The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."</seg>
<seg id="10">Not bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, since 7 a.m. Polin sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.</seg>
<seg id="14">The bidder construction: Here her idol, whose poster hanging in Szczecin, has lived since Monday evening.</seg>
<seg id="15">The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs just as much every day as her Mama Ewa earns in half a year.</seg>

<seg id="24">For the advertisement in the advertising break of the Superbowl, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pile company spilled many, many dollars into the bidder account.</seg>
<seg id="25">And for every doll that looks like he or she is going through the cheek, Bieber also cashes.</seg>
<seg id="26">If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you are amazed at the window window.</seg>
<seg id="27">He is said to have exploited more than 100 million.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some say the hype would be too far.</seg>
<seg id="29">Others stress that bidders are, after all, in the United States and the United Kingdom, with his new single "What do you mean?" In place 1.</seg>

<seg id="1">Metcash launches Soil Standing Campaign to Fight Aldi-</seg>
<seg id="2">Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi rally in South Australia and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Wholesalers Metcash have launched a groundbreaking campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media, as well as through events like Adelaide show.</seg>
<seg id="5">IGA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Ice Manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes samples in IGA stores and store owners selling cheaper tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when wholesalers for food, alcohol and equipment carry out their annual investor strategy day.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30% of Metcashs IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA networks in the East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30% in South Australia and 24% in Western Australia compared to around 14% in the East.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will swallow around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will remove all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to a report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million annually and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and achieve sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash is losing market shares in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and that market share will be reduced from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass's comments.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is assumed that a member of the Management Board of Metcash contacted Mr Douglass last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">IGAS's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and revenues from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43% since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The wholesaler, however, resists and invests more than $150 million every week to match selling prices with Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products, and to improve IGA retailers' ability to improve their stores by increasing fresh food and providing a better choice of private label food.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcash's Chief Executive, Ian Morrice, says that price adjustments and shop remediation programs will increase to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Steve Healy, President of Australia</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, the youngest of the talented duo, often referred to as "Special Ks," was caught in the spotlight by Kyrgios' infamous confrontation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, saying: "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."</seg>
<seg id="6">While he was last seen how he crushed a tennis racquet after a tie thwarted a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the second single place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.</seg>
<seg id="8">"One thing about which I am rather more adventurous is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi has been drawn a little into the dispute," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He broke a racquet when he lost a tie in the US Open, but he is not the first player to break a rogue with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much credit.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little too strictly.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the envelope, he is trained hard, he is good in form, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I believe he deserves his own merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for all, but he assures the man of Canberra to return to the team as a long-term integral part. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"First we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.</seg>
<seg id="15">I believe that Nick has made the rise very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out.</seg>

<seg id="12">However, Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in torn Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that an agreement would be reached - next month or by the end of the year - that the EU countries would accept another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday for a special European Union summit to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on early action by Brussels or its neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tuesday's emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could close down roads and speed up asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire bridge along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after ending a fence on the Serbian border.</seg>
<seg id="17">CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison groups were deployed during the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="18">Over the last few months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and an entry point into the European Union for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="19">Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of the coming economic migrants are seeking a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly contradicts other EU countries, including Germany.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damaging the 4-meter (13 feet) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia a crime, and they also impose higher prison sentences on convicted traffickers.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian Government explains the state of emergency," said the government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs Reporters in the southern town of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="22">We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.</seg>
<seg id="23">Parliament still has to approve the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but Reporters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gyorgy Bakondi, Country Security Adviser for Orban, said that authorities had already penetrated 45 people in an attempt to cross the border, while 15 others had already entered the country deeper.</seg>
<seg id="25">They come here by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities are in the process of fixing the fence quickly.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, after a drawbridge with barbed wire to close the borders.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people's data and cut a crowd to penetrate there.</seg>
<seg id="29">About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead before Bernie Sanders halved in national survey</seg>
<seg id="2">Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to take a double-digit lead in the democratic race for national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins over her.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now has the support of 47% of democratic voters in primary elections (58% earlier), while Sanders is second, with 27% (17% increase).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency, receives support from 15% of democratic voters in the primary elections.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the elections began, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is clear which candidates they will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's supporters are more stable than those of the other candidates in their election.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some profits.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates, but these origins have diminished.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and they and Sanders are now equal.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Clinton still has a big advantage over older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton was with double-digit liberals ahead of Sanders, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in that group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of the democratic voters of the primary elections nationwide say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">One quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15% would only support it because it is the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six per cent would not support them.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it.</seg>
<seg id="17">The views are more mixed with those who do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48% of democratic voters say that they enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35%).</seg>
<seg id="19">If Clinton's supporters are asked about an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10%).</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton's supporters also mention their link with Bill Clinton (9%).</seg>
<seg id="21">Consent to dealing with the problems and eligibility are also quoted.</seg>
<seg id="22">As Vice-President throws a potential for the presidency into the balance, 57% of democratic voters want to see him in the race - though a third believes he should not.</seg>
<seg id="23">When democratic voters are asked who would be their second election for the party, Biden is at the forefront.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of Clinton's followers, more than half say that Biden would be her second election well before Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Biden chooses not to stand for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead before Sanders increases from 20 points to 30 points without him.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fifty-five% of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election, but that figure fell 78% last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees it as the "most selective" has risen.</seg>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, when asked what is more important for a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about eligibility.</seg>
<seg id="29">Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these primary-election voters is deemed unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Democratic candidates or potential candidates yield good results on some key features of their party's primary election.</seg>
<seg id="31">Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy, with strong leadership.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden best performs with honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is leadership.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not think so.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic voters in the primary elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically in line with their views.</seg>
<seg id="35">In all these measurements, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion from Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server continue to be asked during the term of office as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it is another story for the American public as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">Public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton's general opinion, although 36% said that their opinion had deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views have become worse by Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="42">Although Clinton is regarded by her party voters as honest and trustworthy, this remains a problem for her as a whole among registered voters: Only 32% see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month, and 15 points less since May.</seg>
<seg id="43">62% of voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55% of voters across the country view Trump as unhonest and untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="45">But Clinton and Trump receive good marks from leaders.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush perform best with honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">A majority view Sanders as being honest, but, like Carson, many have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ben Carson on a nationwide poll near Donald Trump</seg>
<seg id="2">Ben Carson is closely behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News / New York Times survey</seg>
<seg id="3">The two candidates now account for half of voters' support in the new survey, and others lose dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican voters continue to support Trump on a large scale across the country, with support growing by 27% in the last CBS survey held before Fox News last month.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Carson shot in the same period from 6% to 23%.</seg>
<seg id="6">The survey also showed that Carson is well received by demographic groups, exceeding Trump with higher education among Republican voters.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, was cut off with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who fell the deepest, from 10% last month's support to now 2%.</seg>
<seg id="8">Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.</seg>
<seg id="9">The margin of error for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Minus 6% and was carried out in September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The latest CNN / ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is rising in the polls - reaching 19% of Republican support, behind which Trump has 32% support.</seg>
<seg id="11">The latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.</seg>
<seg id="12">With a carson rising last week, Trump found some side hips for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's belief.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five members of the Brotherhood burdened with the death of Baruch College Neulings</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost two years after a student died in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, during a Shia ritual, murder charges are filed against five people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of New York's Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013, delaying his transport to the hospital, contributing to his death.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials said that he had been burdened with a 30-pound rucksack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target through a frozen field.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he was unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited one hour before they brought him to hospital, according to the police.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, they had the time to change clothes, google his symptoms, and Andy Meng to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice, said Polizeief Chris Wagner at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, members began to hide Utensilia and put the welfare of the Brotherhood above Michael Deng's," said Polizeief Wagner.</seg>
<seg id="9">He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.</seg>
<seg id="10">After a car victory report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with stubborn force injuries on the head, fuselage and thighs.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Too many families were destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.</seg>
<seg id="13">A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for murders of the third grade for the first five members.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also indicted for flagrant attacks and the formation of a criminal association.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We do not just want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organisation that - officially or informally - has sanctioned this, we will hold it to account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation to the local group.</seg>

<seg id="1">This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">Interest rates will rise, and the house will fall into disarray, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">We know that.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last.</seg>
<seg id="5">In particular, history provides little guidance for business.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recession came within 11 months of the first interest-rate hike and lasted 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result, US central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.</seg>
<seg id="9">Indeed, several variables play a role.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the end of the day, however, market participants could conclude that the whole excitement caused by an increase in interest rates may have been exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of" cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, Chief Economist at Capital Economics, in a Communication to customers.</seg>
<seg id="12">By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still to low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here is a look at how some sectors of the economy could respond, based on historical trends:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market saw last month, anticipating interest-rate increases can make things volatile for a while.</seg>
<seg id="16">Once the increase arrives, influence is not so dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There seems to be a tendency for asset yields to be depreciated 12 to 24 months after the first increase, perhaps reflecting the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happens after Fed interest-rate increases.</seg>
<seg id="18">More precisely, over the past 35 years, the market has mostly been on the upward trend - about 14% - on the path to raising interest rates, rather flat in the 250 days thereafter (average profit of 2.6%), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average yield in the past six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis by Nuber.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche Bank said that the impact on shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle, and the return is beginning to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rates often encourage them.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current case, the Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">What is most remarkable is that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point with the Fed raising interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest-rate hikes since 1950 have seen nominal GDP below 4.5%.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect it to continue and expect only 1.5% for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Interest-rate increases in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question "whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants have been looking for a Fed interest rate hike all year round, and all eyes were turned to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, futures trading only indicates a 25% probability.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study, all the increases from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing GDP momentum, and pre-recession levels have been put in the shadows very soon after the recovery began," the report says.</seg>
<seg id="29">By contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, and so far it has been 74 months.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is rather similar to that of the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic stance.</seg>
<seg id="33">With bonds, returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / reduction takes place in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.</seg>
<seg id="35">Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will bring yields closer to one another between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a flat curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High-interest bonds often yield better returns in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income Analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Alongside the dollar's strength and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, credit margins have expanded, and volatility has increased - all the features of the market if the Fed tightens its strategy.</seg>
<seg id="40">By and large, companies that carry out the larger part of their business in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">High-debt multinationals will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, as well as financing their debts.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that" quality "shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with a strong track record have exceeded an average of 5 percentage points after each of the savings increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">Debt is becoming a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most, said Goldman.</seg>
<seg id="47">Outside pure equity games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers could see gains from higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham</seg>
<seg id="2">The Conservative Member criticised the channel for its "curvature"</seg>
<seg id="3">He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.</seg>
<seg id="4">He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits.</seg>
<seg id="5">Parliament's colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.</seg>
<seg id="6">BBC Radio 3 "converts" to Classic FM, claims a leading Member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private channels do not do.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also said to the BBC Bossen that the public radio station "stupid" and increasingly no longer distinguishes it from its commercial competitors.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Radio 3 does not seem to like - I use the word" dump "- but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be under a different name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously cited examples where you actually only imitate what is already on the market, "said Mr Bingham.</seg>
<seg id="12">BBC Director General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was well ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.</seg>
<seg id="13">What I learn from Radio 3, I will learn about classical music nowhere else.</seg>
<seg id="14">And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.</seg>
<seg id="15">"And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works is really important," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder work needs to be done to engage the public than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.</seg>
<seg id="17">Radio 3 was not, however, the only element of the BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport to get the commercial rivals on its feet.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?</seg>
<seg id="20">Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was "produced in a special BBC way."</seg>
<seg id="21">He added that he wanted the company to "find a hit from our own stables" when it launched an entertainment series next time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Internet sales increased in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this.</seg>
<seg id="2">In the first three months of 2015, there were seven percent increase in online sales.</seg>
<seg id="3">Last month there was the lowest result since records began in 2000</seg>
<seg id="4">Online sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile phones for shopping</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe that black Friday in November held back spending</seg>
<seg id="6">For more than a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain's shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.</seg>
<seg id="7">But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating, with new figures showing only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only 5% increase on the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures show only 7% growth in the first three months of 2015</seg>
<seg id="10">"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go down until 2000, that has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="11">He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started shopping with their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="12">It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="13">But now that is getting underway, and we may see that growth is diminishing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The black-Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the declining turnover.</seg>
<seg id="15">Experts believe that buyers withhold their purchases before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year, five times the average number of purchasers grabbed around their computers to make their bargains, and some dealers "websites collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for bargains, could discourage buyers from making purchases.</seg>
<seg id="18">A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of £5, just over £1 was spent online.</seg>
<seg id="19">For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in fashion chains in inner cities.</seg>

<seg id="2">The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims through the streets at the first funerals in Mecca.</seg>
<seg id="3">Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group at risk</seg>
<seg id="4">The Ministry of Health said that 394 people were also injured after the Crane crashed</seg>
<seg id="5">Hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane of Mecca's grandmoshee collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grieving filled, largely dressed in white, the distance to pay tribute when the first of the dead entered the Al Moaissem cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="7">The procession of mourning moved to the Holy Plateau, where only days before a builder crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then to the begging.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which left 394 injured.</seg>
<seg id="9">The bodies of 29 fathers who were killed when a crane collapsed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane underscored.</seg>
<seg id="11">MR Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddy in the Great Mosque.</seg>
<seg id="12">Saudi officials have already made a firm commitment that the Haddy will continue to Mecca with thousands of people who will continue to come to the city.</seg>
<seg id="13">Today, King Salman said that the Bin Laden Group should not have left the arm of the crane out when it was not used.</seg>
<seg id="14">An Arab version of the decree published by the Saudi State Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was partly responsible for the collapse.</seg>
<seg id="15">The news agency's English-speaking service did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was forbidden to travel abroad.</seg>

<seg id="1">B & Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over</seg>
<seg id="2">Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury</seg>
<seg id="3">The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a result, 200 more Screwfix shops targeting craftsmen will be opened.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets nationwide</seg>
<seg id="6">By Rupert Steiner, City Chief correspondent of Daily Mail</seg>
<seg id="7">It is claimed that Britons are setting up their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who work in their homes.</seg>
<seg id="8">If you can handle a hammer or brush skilfully to paint walls, you seem to be a minority today.</seg>
<seg id="9">The British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out home jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B & Q.</seg>
<seg id="10">Véronique Laury, the new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now outdated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore Kingfisher plans to open 200 other Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B & Q outlets.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mrs Laury said she wants to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions are made by women.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the moment, the men dominate the staff.</seg>
<seg id="14">She said that it was necessary to address the growing demographic trends that have more female single households, which are making more renovations than in the past.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mrs Laury said: "It still works a majority of men in our branches.</seg>
<seg id="16">We must move this more towards a balance.</seg>
<seg id="17">In principle, half of our customers are women with 80% of the decision to buy articles from women.</seg>
<seg id="18">Women play a major role in the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK leading company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.</seg>
<seg id="20">Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50% of the team with women, including its management and financial management.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mrs Laury said: "This was a deliberate decision - diversity is an important issue here.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profit and sales after the group was responsible for closing the stores.</seg>
<seg id="24">Due to the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new stores.</seg>

<seg id="1">Officials of Aich / Dob for infidelity in court</seg>
<seg id="2">At the regional court Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vizemeister Aich / Dob had to answer on Wednesday for infidelity and tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="3">The defendants were not guilty.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of them had also been accused of abuse of office.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was finally acquitted of this accusation in May.</seg>
<seg id="6">The current process has been postponed.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation revealed that in 2006-2011, the accused used funds from association accounts that allowed them to display in their functions for private purposes.</seg>
<seg id="8">The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sports functionaries are also accused of financial crime.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the fact that the chairman of the opening Senate, Michaela Sanin, has left.</seg>
<seg id="11">It will be negotiated later.</seg>
<seg id="12">In order to repudiate the infidelity, the defense stated that the association had never created an asset disadvantage.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sports functionaries would only have calculated expenses and exited the sports club for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011, where they had invested a lot of time and money, from the debt - Passiva accounted for some 600,000 schilling (approximately 44.000 euros) in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="14">"At that time we were faced with the situation: Continue or close the club?," one of the defendants, in the brokerage profession, told the Financial Office's large-scale auditors.</seg>
<seg id="15">He then decided, with his colleague and co-defendant, to take up this task.</seg>
<seg id="16">With all risks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We have made money, put our life insurance at the bank's disposal," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was agreed with the association: You can manage the money freely, you cannot make any debt.</seg>
<seg id="19">Furthermore, in the event of appropriate financial success, the payment of the expenses was decided retroactively by 1991.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, only years later, from 2003, when a plus had been on the account, some of the expenses were paid out.</seg>
<seg id="21">Therefore, flat-rate and non-detailed bookings appeared, the former Obmann explained the events.</seg>
<seg id="22">The accounts and savings books jointly managed the two defendants, said the second defendants.</seg>
<seg id="23">The judge asked why the payouts had not been disclosed to the club in detail.</seg>
<seg id="24">The association had not been interested in the detail of financial management, the answer was that only debt-free was important.</seg>
<seg id="25">In 2011, when a functioneer started investigating abuses, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those were reserves, the defendants explained.</seg>
<seg id="27">This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the club according to his statement.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Why?," the judge wanted to know.</seg>
<seg id="29">The interviewee knew no answer.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.</seg>
<seg id="31">If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about that money, the prosecutor put it in the room.</seg>
<seg id="32">The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.</seg>
<seg id="33">This transfer was formulated as "compensation for damage."</seg>
<seg id="34">Why claims?, judges and prosecutors wanted to know.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first defendant explained that he was not in agreement with this formulation because the association had never suffered any damage.</seg>
<seg id="36">But what should I do when the lawyer says, "You are all out of the tailoring."</seg>
<seg id="37">He asked.</seg>
<seg id="38">Furthermore, the official said that he never paid a cent salary, he had only calculated mileage and allowances.</seg>
<seg id="39">He has charged the club with €1,000 per month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.</seg>
<seg id="40">The accused were unable to provide accurate documentation for the early years.</seg>
<seg id="41">They were no longer kept after an operational audit in which everything had been considered correct, they explained.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mileage allowance was also obtained by the second defendant.</seg>
<seg id="43">He said in his statement.</seg>
<seg id="44">The main negotiation will continue on 23 September with the consultation of witnesses.</seg>

<seg id="2">In addition to reducing staff over the last three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs when the company is split.</seg>

<seg id="4">As part of its restructuring, the US Technology Group plans to dismantle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate clientele.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is intended to save $2.7 billion (€2.4 billion), the company announced on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The move would lead to a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which will come from the fourth quarter.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world watches when the US Federal Reserve meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates have been raised for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">A survey of 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that a little more than half, who thought last week that the Fed would do so, now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer, keeping interest rates at their current level at 0-0.25%.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is an historic event because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates on NULL.</seg>
<seg id="5">"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Chief Executive Officer of Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The US economy is relatively good, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate little inflation.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global conditions.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has warned markets to adjust to an increase, but the evidence suggests that the chances of such a move are good.</seg>
<seg id="9">The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday</seg>

<seg id="2">After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" at the first murder and wanted "he could not do it" on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10: 00 on Monday morning.</seg>
<seg id="4">And said he shot at someone and killed someone.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lamb told the emergency call centre staff that police had to send policemen to their homes.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said, "I shot my wife yesterday evening" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but that "nobody will disturb" but will probably be excited.</seg>
<seg id="7">The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give him.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.</seg>
<seg id="9">When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, who said: "I am so sorry, I wanted to undo it.</seg>
<seg id="10">I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me. "</seg>
<seg id="11">After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when policemen surrounded him.</seg>
<seg id="12">University President William LaForge said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's presentation."</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, on Tuesday, authorities said that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship."</seg>
<seg id="14">Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married about seven years ago as a "good man."</seg>
<seg id="15">The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.</seg>
<seg id="16">O'Steen said that he and Prentiss had a daughter 19, and she was "destroyed on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends."</seg>
<seg id="18">Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.</seg>
<seg id="19">Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog called Lightning, had met Lamb for about three years.</seg>
<seg id="20">Said Knowles</seg>
<seg id="21">The police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them that he was not going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="22">When policemen picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb drove his car to the side, flew on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.</seg>
<seg id="23">Lamb received a PhD from Delta State University in spring 2015, as his life law indicates on the University's website.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="3">Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group alone wants to save with a better organisation.</seg>
<seg id="4">150 of the world's 1000 executives will cost the company's restructuring work.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the pilot trade union has opened new negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lufthansa is developing its corporate structure and is upgrading low-cost Eurowings.</seg>
<seg id="7">The objective of the realignment was to contribute about EUR 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies, and announced on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for passenger business.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible.</seg>
<seg id="10">Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the board team for Chief Carsten Spohr.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the new edition, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to oppose Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">Until now, the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex.</seg>
<seg id="13">The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.</seg>
<seg id="14">New negotiations with pilots</seg>
<seg id="15">In the collective dispute with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations will resume after the court strike on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="16">That was what the trade union said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Discussions will focus on the retirement scheme for pilots.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cockpit wanted to "achieve sustainable results as soon as possible with a forecast record result."</seg>
<seg id="19">The conflict between the trade union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition to the transitional supply of pilots, the concept of "Wings."</seg>
<seg id="21">It provides for Lufthansa to outsource routes to Eurowings' own low-cost airline in the fight against competitors.</seg>

<seg id="2">Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.</seg>
<seg id="3">While this has brought the left-wing defender to the fore and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not express the hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.</seg>
<seg id="4">The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after the 20-year-old Shaw had entered the PSV area.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."</seg>
<seg id="7">It will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, has very difficult and then plays fantastic, and then that happens.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the changing cabin he had an oxygen mask.</seg>
<seg id="10">He wept.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture it will take six months and it will not play in the group phase.</seg>
<seg id="12">I hope he can play this season again.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and imposed an elephant.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexicans.</seg>
<seg id="15">Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can judge for yourself when I say that an elephant and a red card were due.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was a very serious attack with both legs.</seg>

<seg id="22">When a player leaves the place with this kind of injury, all are very sad about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is never the intention of our players to violate an opponent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="25">"He is very difficult because it was not his intention to violate the opponent, and when you hear that it is a very serious injury, that is not good," said Cocu.</seg>
<seg id="26">For me it was not possible to see the moment.</seg>
<seg id="27">The only thing I could see was the ball that went in a different direction, so it looked like he had touched [Moreno], but I could not see the attack on Luke.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take long for you to know it almost by heart.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unless you are perhaps David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">When asked by a childcare provider to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss's environmental fake in 1971.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of SuperCamps, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read out to my children, because it always seems to give an image or message we have missed."</seg>
<seg id="6">All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the book's action, instead reflects a summary of the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the midst of the converted city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," says Seuss, whose love interest was unknown.</seg>
<seg id="8">As if that were not yet suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lorax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins: "In the converted city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Auge hopes to win the heart of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, Cameron seems unlikely to be so unfamiliar with the book's action.</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Downing Street spokesperson said that the text was likely to come from Cameron's electoral office.</seg>
<seg id="12">SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but did not give any further direct comments.</seg>

<seg id="11">If, hopefully, he forgets further purchases for Yorkshire, there is another chance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not perform so well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how much time a test bugman gets to set his mark is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick became nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got the chance to play home and outward.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only accusation that can be made was that England first invoked Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but that lost opportunity is now in the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hales comes in, and he is a drummer I value highly.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is an X-factor cricket player, which we saw early this season at Yorkshire, when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which hit us very hard.</seg>
<seg id="19">He must be given at least the same opportunities as those before him, but of course this depends on the crew in the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea of beating Moeen next to Cook, which would produce an extra-spin bowler and receive four quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I do not see why a drummer cannot beat there, and this left-wing party has already shown that he is a vicious cricket player.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for her, and there is no big difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an Opener in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24">He immediately made three hundred smoke and did not look back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the box as a back-up spin, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me as a young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People may look at their statistics - on average 31 with the racquet and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there are no large number of backup spinning men who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">He will learn a lot on this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">Apart from the team, England has made some clever additions to the Trainerstab.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan Batsman, as adviser to the test games, could be a mastercoup.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the most nice guys of the game, who will bring a wealth of experience as he played under all conditions and against all attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always felt he was created for the international cricket competition as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes, new voices can bring fresh air to the changing cabin, even if the news is consistent with what has been said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used for the One Dayers, Root received a similar pause against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it.</seg>
<seg id="35">Some will not agree, but coaches and team creators do not set the timetable.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you must remember that, as with players, their jobs depend on the results.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions are not taken lightly.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Brexit camp (Brexit = exit from the EU) could gain in gain if the economy gets bogged down by 2017</seg>
<seg id="2">David Cameron's uncharted renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or TUC, who fought fiercely for Europe on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.</seg>
<seg id="4">A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entrenched in various crises as the EU is, and not always out of their own fault, are tired of Britain's own agenda, with divided concessions and disruptive treaty changes, which they usually do not want.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they jeopardise social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie's agenda.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prime ministers and finance ministers climb at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reform.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is always about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European friend, who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Let us not alone with France," says Berlin - and sees that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to the point where they do not care whether we stay or go.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany's cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as happened with the excessively long-running like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14), and Kohl (16).</seg>
<seg id="11">France's François Hollande looks forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is also a congested force.</seg>
<seg id="13">Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is hard to imagine that they will be enough to help the Selfie British, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something that they do not want, because most similar separatist tendencies have.</seg>
<seg id="15">So some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful remarks, entirely SNP-style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspect.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Renegotiation was a stalemate," and "Britain won't win anything of value from renegotiation."</seg>
<seg id="17">Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at its cost, and what EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were during the 1975 referendum, inspired by Tony Benn, who supported our entry in 1973 with a 2: 1 ratio.</seg>
<seg id="18">You can remember weak Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro-Opportunists, who made a name as an "EU-Gerade bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="19">With all his ruthlessness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.</seg>
<seg id="20">This included the Medley of tax-fearing rogues, telephone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo-non-indigenous people who own most of our big newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, Tony Blair thought similar about her, but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot Gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="22">Indeed, miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he opposed Cameroon's referendum, because Blair had put forward the principle of the EU's unadopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press has never disliked him.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly piano on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he needed no more time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 80's, a mistake then and today.</seg>
<seg id="25">It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyn's official position on Europe is - and I say it is kind - developing.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Well, most people outside Ukip's traditional blood-color tendency and the wild cartoons of Torys Klein-Englanism can say yes.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said this week on radio and television, when the Pfadfinder fought in him, did not admit that Corbyn's appointment as shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 70's when his old father tried to be unloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues on television without going too far and losing his cabinet job.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilary's fight was even more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But fighting to "stay in all circumstances" - Benns expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow combatants and MPs after all the reports at their small meeting on Monday evening.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whatever Corbyn's arduous bottom-up image - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the structure of the social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to see Labou's support in the referendum campaign as a matter of course, as McDonnell said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguity about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.</seg>
<seg id="37">As with his ambiguities with Nato - Tom Watson is well convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless?</seg>
<seg id="39">The US is already rather disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even with a cut in the cost of the Tory government in power, something I was reminded of at Monday's launch of what British Influence Security Forum called.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticise Public Health England report on e-cigarettes</seg>
<seg id="2">Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, partly linked to the tobacco industry, researchers said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (phe) in their report on e-cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Phe published the "Policy Report" last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">However, some researchers questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">A leading article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy foundation," on which phe established its main conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">They said that the public expects that the claim of phe that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.</seg>
<seg id="10">Indeed, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a model for multi-criteria decision-making analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) in order to summarise their views on the damage caused to different nicotine products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing directors had previously received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also signed BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding that he was supposed to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International after reports.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reasons for selecting the members of the Body are not provided, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate sector financing in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some other participants in this meeting are not aware of their know-how in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">The tobacco management was also part of the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="17">McKee and Capewell wrote.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, none of these links or restrictions is discussed in the phe report.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Capewell said that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are a way of smoking for children or non-smokers" was premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at phe, said that BMJ's claims had already been reacted to.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">Every second life-long smoker dies from his addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">Phe has a clear duty to inform the public about what proves and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion a year.</seg>
<seg id="26">By clearly stating current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national competence.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC should give up Eastenders, says former Channel 4 boss</seg>
<seg id="2">The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs like Eastenders and The Voice, saying that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like Albert Square Soap.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs not broadcast by other UK channels.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters like BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that, for six years in his time at Channel 4, he had tried to get in touch with the BBC without success.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have problems with the idea that BBC contracts or sends programmes that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidised rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus Communication Committee in his study of the future of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least place your production on programmes that others do not do or order.</seg>
<seg id="8">They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want the widest possible support for their future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is of course nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax fund programs that could be financed without subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is one such program, Eastenders is another, admittedly both own productions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Frankly, other channels would give their rightful arm.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am trying to see how this should be public television.</seg>
<seg id="14">I do not believe that this would actually reduce the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, an entrepreneur for series that ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the hunt for ratings "because of the aspirations of the people working there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments on the most popular BBC broadcasts reflect what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like Eastenders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said that the more public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can't measure quite the audience, but they do their job, and they can argue if they go to their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion radio charges," Now, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen. "</seg>
<seg id="18">They put them in a window of time where no one ever wanted to see them.</seg>
<seg id="19">As regards the broadcasting fee, Johnson said to the committee: 'I call on you to find a more regressive system with regard to conditions for who can get the best value from it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course you all think, we all think, that you get a great value for £150 per year here, but for people who are a lot of money for the £150, I wonder if that is true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">Former Sky- and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also said before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review its Reithian mission, "inform, educate, and maintain."</seg>
<seg id="22">He said that little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on radio - and she should take an example from public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this in "inform, educate and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="23">On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only a handful of people are shown on television, and enter into alliances with commercial channels to make everything available online.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sonogenetics can control brain cells through sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">The video shows how the Nematods change the direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound pulses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tiny Nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound-rays that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.</seg>
<seg id="5">The impulses work by activating Motoneuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">More on this subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electric impulse to people's brain to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fadenworms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bubbles, he found out, reinforce the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">To create ultrasound-controlled Nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.</seg>
<seg id="14">When applying ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microblades and transferred to the worms where they turn on the modified motoneurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with impulses of light.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technique.</seg>
<seg id="17">In contrast to light, which must be sent to the desired place in the brain at an optical fiber, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass freely and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.</seg>

<seg id="13">The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.</seg>

<seg id="19">Another of the anti-arms trading posters greets the commanders in the underground.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works not only with the graphic artist and Voiceover, who also works for free.</seg>
<seg id="21">VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the arms fair - through a lease of the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "Let us give them the campaign that they try to avoid."</seg>
<seg id="22">They played with the invention of a more realistic tender company advertisement, but "it remains more durable through the introduction of bright colours and animation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"You have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="24">What we need now is intervention by the British Government and a guarantee that torture equipment will not be illegally traded on our doorstep.</seg>
<seg id="25">Perhaps the most creative art around the Arms Fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors miraculously conceal euphemistic products.</seg>

<seg id="1">Eight golden rules for life in student homes</seg>
<seg id="2">Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I angered - and the many long-term complaints about others.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">The entry into student homes ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely shocking.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is tempting to swallow: People tell where you come from, whether and where you have taken sabbage year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you "honestly do not love or hate Marmite because in seriousness, boys, it is just a yeast extract hahaha, I am in my room."</seg>
<seg id="6">Breathe.</seg>
<seg id="7">And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">It guides the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like, unlike those you would not talk to, even if your whistles were burning and these fire extinguishers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Let people.</seg>
<seg id="10">People's rooms are often transformed into drinks, film night venues and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people are attracted and their underwear adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="11">Referring to this: Do not think of starting a relationship with the Uni</seg>
<seg id="12">Introverted receive a rough treatment at the university.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a space-to-space-stroll culture that is friendly, social and can lead to life-long friendship.</seg>
<seg id="14">That can be hell for someone who tries to recover.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nothing in culture allows you to say: "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away to get back the energy I used for interaction with you."</seg>
<seg id="16">Try to feel when a commander of conviviality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of knocking.</seg>
<seg id="17">Appropos: Do it.</seg>
<seg id="18">A guy in my student homes had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.</seg>
<seg id="19">He saw some things.</seg>
<seg id="20">Close friendship by baking.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since you start the Uni at the height of the back mania, the cloak at the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of browsers is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 "s" Welcome to the neighborhood, I have put something to you. "So, and now please ask you personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="22">Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to make friendships.</seg>
<seg id="23">Your fellow citizens feel obliged to entertain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a tasty surprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.</seg>
<seg id="25">Poorly mixed puppies of flour, sugar and fat result in people sleeping when you anchor.</seg>
<seg id="26">Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Of course the claw of chickens is a theft, but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea?</seg>
<seg id="28">Check this with the dairy owner.</seg>
<seg id="29">The chances are good that they say they can serve themselves, even if they cook inside.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone steals your stuff, that is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it in a more balanced way than my compatriot, who added a slice of their milk to punish thieves.</seg>
<seg id="31">She is now in prison.</seg>
<seg id="32">They should not make noise that stops people from sleeping or working.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not just a question of being a decent person, but of being one of the people sitting in the glass house in the truest sense of the proverb.</seg>
<seg id="34">A girl on my flight asked her neighbors if it makes sense to put Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="35">They responded with even louder music.</seg>
<seg id="36">When they finally stopped at 5 o'clock, they kindly let their neighbors sleep two hours before letting their own music plundered, closed their door and went to their three-hour test.</seg>
<seg id="37">Would it not be romantic for your future spouse to come to the same student residence by chance?</seg>
<seg id="38">Conversely, would it not be downright embarrassing for you to hold a member for your future spouse, to get to grips with her, to have her separated again and then to see her every day and perhaps to see her taking on all her friends?</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot compatriot is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to give your underbelongings some reason.</seg>

<seg id="1">Row houses for refugees, single parents, low earners</seg>
<seg id="2">The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building terraced houses for people who do not have much money.</seg>
<seg id="3">So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low earners."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I am showing how we can still build cheap and good today," says the 44-year-old in the interview.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes in knowing how to create cheap housing quickly: He is building terraced houses for refugees in a project.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Gildner, many refugees will be forced into the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="8">What solution do you offer?</seg>
<seg id="9">Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers or turkeys is not sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="10">The people remain here to a large extent.</seg>
<seg id="11">Given the influx of refugees, we need sufficient housing in the coming decades.</seg>
<seg id="12">A very banal three-storey terraced house is the solution.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gildner: A rice house needs the least space.</seg>
<seg id="14">It facilitates integration.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is different if people are accommodated in residential blocks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three units for each of four asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">It may be that many refugees will say, it is peace again, I go back.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then the houses can be easily converted according to their needs.</seg>
<seg id="20">What is the cost?</seg>
<seg id="21">Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros, without land.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is manageable.</seg>
<seg id="23">The construction took six months.</seg>
<seg id="24">That is appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="25">Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?</seg>
<seg id="26">Gildner: I have gone through my project correctly.</seg>
<seg id="27">It always makes the looming Damocles sword special construction and the parking regulation particularly complicated.</seg>
<seg id="28">Greece.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is still assumed that those who create three apartments in a terraced house need at least three pitches.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is no place for this only in cities.</seg>
<seg id="31">And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">How did the residents react to their Reihenhaus project?</seg>
<seg id="33">Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="34">What is definitely not true.</seg>
<seg id="35">But do you not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="36">Gildner: True, we have had a building boom in Germany over the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that can hardly afford more.</seg>
<seg id="37">My project has the message, the ordinary people also need housing.</seg>
<seg id="38">Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earners.</seg>
<seg id="39">I show how you can still build cheap and good today.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is what it is about.</seg>
<seg id="41">Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially worked on environmental analysis.</seg>

<seg id="2">The new operating system can be requested by going to the recruitment app, typing in "General" and then selecting "Software Update."</seg>
<seg id="3">If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some have encountered problems after installation because they receive an error message indicating that the "software update failed."</seg>
<seg id="5">To deal with the problem, users are advised either to wait until the crash returns or try to update via iTunes.</seg>
<seg id="6">The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.</seg>
<seg id="7">This may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made this less likely by tightening up the update, and it will also be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and reinstall them when the process is complete.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is close to a charger so that the battery is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off half way and cause the update to crash.</seg>

<seg id="2">Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift joined forces under the heading of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition to consultations you can also take part in courses.</seg>
<seg id="4">The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="5">More specifically, at Graf-Stauffenberg Square.</seg>
<seg id="6">A new post office was opened there recently.</seg>
<seg id="7">Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and counselors will now receive information on issues such as care insurance or health and care services.</seg>
<seg id="8">For years we have found with our outpatient care service that often caring relatives are left alone.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are endless questions.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Also, many of the benefits of the coffers are not often used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," said Jutta Weigand, the new head of the house manager, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the civic hospital and the ambulance service "Amadeus."</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to the consultations, the new Quartiersbüro also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Saludis were taken on board.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, additional offers such as storm prevention, memory training or physiotherapy can be used.</seg>
<seg id="14">The offers of the Seniors Centre and the Saludis are perfectly complementary.</seg>
<seg id="15">Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis, said: "</seg>
<seg id="17">Both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new post office in the city centre especially in demographic change.</seg>
<seg id="18">This makes good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the inauguration ceremonies, the Quartiersbüro also devoted itself to the gathering of old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite you to a regular social meeting."</seg>
<seg id="20">This makes the social foundation a major contribution that seniors can live independently and well in their familiar environment.</seg>
<seg id="21">The office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="3">One from the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, according to the police, followed his two friends at a distance of about five metres and called on them to wait for him.</seg>
<seg id="4">At that time the group was at the level of the bft petrol station.</seg>
<seg id="5">There were also three people on the tank site.</seg>

<seg id="1">Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field and invests €310000</seg>
<seg id="2">Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is also the case with Samuel Mayor Bernd Bormann, Economic Development Officer Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs Mayor Heinfried Kabbert.</seg>
<seg id="4">In many places in the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of rock climbing on 1 October.</seg>
<seg id="5">While Ursel retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich stands by his successor in the next few months with half a job.</seg>
<seg id="6">After a transformation, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he will invest €310000 in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was sympathy at first glance when Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently studying medicine at the Verdener Krankenhaus and who wants to get into practice next year.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We always had in mind that the garbers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.</seg>
<seg id="9">"When it was, I simply called them."</seg>
<seg id="10">The married couple Müller had the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Müller.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We want to know and accompany the families over the years."</seg>
<seg id="13">He also sees his own boss as an advantage.</seg>
<seg id="14">And so it was agreed that the garbers bought the house with practice.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.</seg>
<seg id="16">The two-fold family father Frank Müller grew up there, followed his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is currently working as a senior doctor in Sulingen, and was appointed as Chief Emergency Officer in the Diepholz County in 2009 and is honorably involved in the DRK readiness Bruchhausen-Vilsen.</seg>
<seg id="18">From 19 September the practice for the new boss will be prepared.</seg>
<seg id="19">While surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a physician, his wife Ursel (Internistin) specializes in gastroenterology.</seg>
<seg id="20">The garbers, both internists, want to settle as housewives.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The endoscopy therefore comes out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the reconstruction the rooms will look more modern.</seg>
<seg id="23">We will offer more ultrasound research and long-term and load-bearing EKGS and we need a speaking room more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Furthermore, the EDV will be completely renewed.</seg>
<seg id="25">A total grant of EUR 50000 will be granted to the waste collectors through a programme of support from the district (EUR 25000) and from the Samtgemeinde (EUR 12500) and the municipality (EUR 12500).</seg>
<seg id="26">"This shows just how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued," says Samuel Bormann.</seg>
<seg id="27">According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients come into practice every quarter, with about 500 in northGerman average practice.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Asendorf, there is another practice for domestic use.</seg>
<seg id="29">A positive side effect of Frank Müller's practical takeover: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.</seg>
<seg id="30">If no successor had found himself, it would have gone.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you visit Müller's Sprechstunde, you can still look in familiar faces: Take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the rock.</seg>
<seg id="32">With their departure, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, doctors have practised there for 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="33">"At the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen remembers himself.</seg>
<seg id="34">After a long period of time, they already feel a little fury.</seg>
<seg id="35">"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients still often," says Internistin.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her husband adds laughing: "We have a 6000 square meter plot."</seg>
<seg id="37">"So far, I have always pressed for gardening, now it could be different."</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Now border controls are also high on our southern border," said Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.</seg>
<seg id="3">The controls on the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is still clear that anyone who wishes to apply for asylum can make this "natural."</seg>
<seg id="5">People's care and safety are paramount.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," the Minister said.</seg>
<seg id="7">People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migratory flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.</seg>
<seg id="8">A controlled approach is needed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Croatia considering "Corridor" - Slovenia denied</seg>
<seg id="10">The Croatian Government had previously indicated that Slovenia would also like to allow refugees arriving to travel to Austria and Germany and might also set up corridors for the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="11">This was not the case with Minister Vesna GYÖRKÖS Znidar in Laibach.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," but Slovenia will instead step up border surveillance, especially with Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the other hand, the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="14">As the Minister stressed, Slowenin does not want to close his borders for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Each EU Member State must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system will not work,"</seg>
<seg id="16">As the Croatian Government announced, the first refugees had already tried, during the night hours of Tuesday, to arrive in eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik / sid border to avoid registration.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby Maisfeld.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been invading Tovarnik since then.</seg>
<seg id="19">They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Rescue services and the Red Cross have already been deployed.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the coming days, his country expects about 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moreover, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="23">The government in Belgrade, however, denied that it was the people's intention to take certain routes: "Neither can we, nor do we want to, do so."</seg>
<seg id="24">In any case, according to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees had arrived in the Serbian border town of sid, and more buses would be expected during the day.</seg>
<seg id="25">Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany</seg>
<seg id="26">The inmates had been travelling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border around 500 kilometres away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"We have heard that Hungary has admitted, so the police have told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.</seg>
<seg id="29">This could in fact lead to the postponement of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, which has already been predicted by observers, to a slightly further west.</seg>
<seg id="30">Croatia: "Comprehensive border control options"</seg>
<seg id="31">Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="32">He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had "extensive possibilities for border control."</seg>
<seg id="33">Strict controls are being carried out to qualify for Schengen membership.</seg>
<seg id="34">Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007, and the EU partners have since consistently provided the country with a good record of the standard of border controls.</seg>
<seg id="35">On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to Belgrade's media reports, they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.</seg>
<seg id="37">According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border remains unclear.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nebojsa Stefanovic, tried Wednesday morning to calm down at a local election in Horgos: He considers the debates on alternative routes for refugees, now that the Hungarian border is closed, to be premature.</seg>
<seg id="40">It would not be very large numbers of refugees at present.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.</seg>
<seg id="42">Aid workers advise migrants on - dangerous - alternative routes</seg>
<seg id="43">However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, border crossings between Serbia and Croatia are not inextricably dangerous: In parts of the border area there are still uncleared mines 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.</seg>
<seg id="45">On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine cleaners was sent in the border region.</seg>

<seg id="7">The Ökumenische Hospizhilfe drew attention to its 20-year-old existence and faces mixed reactions.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is all about life, so we went to the heart of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.</seg>
<seg id="9">The head of the Ökumenische Hospizhilfe is available to passers for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">While some passers spontaneously pick up and add the phrase "my life affirm," "read," "with the camper going through the USA," "stop the war" or "do not suffer long," others stay short, read, say phrases like "so far I'm not yet" and go on.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the sidelines, small discussions about the action itself, about life, about how to deal with death.</seg>
<seg id="12">Peter Hübinger is also on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Only if I realise that the end of this world will come to me at some point, can I live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonese factory Mannheim, who, together with the Caritaso Association, is the winner of the Ökumenische Hospizhilfe.</seg>
<seg id="14">That is why this public action is good for the 20-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables, because it is a very personal matter.</seg>
<seg id="16">The subject of death and death remains taboo, according to Josefine Lammer's experience, even though the hospike movement in recent years has helped to open up people.</seg>
<seg id="17">An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.</seg>
<seg id="18">The funeral and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.</seg>
<seg id="19">Confronted by personal experiences with the subject, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the Ökumenische Hospizhilfe searched for honorary officials, she immediately registered and was present at the foundation in 1995.</seg>
<seg id="21">Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honorary officials - 43 women and two men - who accompany the person concerned and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospiz Sankt Vincent.</seg>
<seg id="22">They are all well trained.</seg>
<seg id="23">Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences she has gained.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I see life from another wait, think it is precious and appreciate the moment," she says.</seg>
<seg id="25">The offer of the ambulant Ökumenische Hospizdienst is free and non-confessional.</seg>
<seg id="26">The financial support of the sickness funds and donations from relatives and associations enables the training, training and supervisions of the sisters of death and mourning.</seg>
<seg id="27">Training for new employees is offered every two years.</seg>
<seg id="28">The panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).</seg>

<seg id="1">FedEx earnings mixed, financial outlook reduced for 2016</seg>
<seg id="2">FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the Liefer Gigant reduced its profit outlook to a whole year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said that it plans to hire some 55.000 seasonal workers for holidays.</seg>
<seg id="4">At this point in time last year FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for holiday time.</seg>
<seg id="5">The share fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts expected $10.84 according to a factSet poll.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which averaged 4.9% and become effective on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large packages from November onwards.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said that it still expects the result to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trade.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "generates solid returns when considering weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."</seg>
<seg id="11">The holiday employment plans were announced one day later than that of the Rival UPS, which plans to employ 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than last year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just below the $2.44 per share that 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six zacks questioned analysts expected $12.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping over the last few years, leading to stagnation in its unit express shipping.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last quarter, sales of ground transport rose by 29%, but the operating result was essentially flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In premarket trading, about one hour before opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Tuesday, they lost 11% for the year and 17% below a record high on 11 June.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">At their most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the policy rate for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="2">At the end of the two-storey sitting room there is a wall in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should set the nation's economic interests before anything else.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Bank has a dual mandate from Congress: To keep US employment and prices stable here.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the Great Recession, the Fed has recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict; it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be weathered by the unprecedented stimulus of the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although most of the economy's data show that it is growing solid, recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed officials frightening to increase this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds - even a quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economist at the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co. Kg.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to raise interest rates, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue waiting," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus about what the Fed is going to do, what is in itself uncertain about the financial market.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of the economists recently questioned by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, unless strategists mitigate the blow by promising that a further increase is far removed.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial averaged 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If it does, "she would have to go very far in her statement to reassure financial markets so that they do not panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets, because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.</seg>
<seg id="19">Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen had said in spring and early summer that, despite the liberals "complaints that more economic progress was needed, she expected an increase in the rate.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although job creation slowed down in August, improvements in the labour market this year were solid.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and near the level the Fed sees as full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="24">And, while inflation has been below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, Fed officials have said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The economy "can manage higher interest rates and needs them because of labor-market tension," said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But, at the end of last month, financial markets around the world merged after China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% in May, when investors feared that a slowdown in China's economy would slash global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has recovered somewhat this month, with Dow now close to 10% below May's.</seg>
<seg id="29">For Fed officials, market turbulence influences complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="30">Said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former US Federal Reserve official.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now he predicts that she will wait at least one month to better manage the impact.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," Oliner said.</seg>
<seg id="33">The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main concerns, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="34">But, in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.</seg>
<seg id="35">The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mere suggestion by the then head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Her decision is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the asset management of Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that seem not to be linked to economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to raising interest rates, cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited recognizable effects on US growth," he said.</seg>
<seg id="42">One year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should place financial stability first in a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest-rate fixing committee.</seg>
<seg id="44">The recent turbulence does not come close to this level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"It certainly does not want to get into the situation where it is afraid of raising interest rates because markets are getting bogged down," said Poznan, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe it should be delayed.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS is trying to educate women in a shocking way about the importance of good nutrition during the breadth period.</seg>
<seg id="3">Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Due to additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers will be advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietetic adjustment that mothers should make.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study led by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.</seg>

<seg id="1">Derogations for the new amber sport hall</seg>
<seg id="2">The municipal council Bernried approved the construction application for the €2.3 million sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="3">And he made an exception.</seg>
<seg id="4">The roof may become flat for solar panels.</seg>
<seg id="5">The plans for the long-awaited Turnhallenbau at the Bernrieder Sportground are progressing step by step: The most recent municipal meeting unanimously approved the draft project without much discussion.</seg>
<seg id="6">Prior to that, the Body had decided, inter alia, on an application for a "exception" of the current construction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7">The "exception" was about permission for a special form concerning roof construction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus, a "saddle roof with a non-coarse first and umbrella" is to be built.</seg>
<seg id="9">The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "This will give us a wonderful southern roof together," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="10">The "liberation" was, in turn, about the roofing tendency, which, for energy reasons, should be below 10 degrees, unlike required by the construction plan.</seg>
<seg id="11">This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.</seg>
<seg id="12">A "liberation" was necessary because the construction plan for roofing does not allow "exceptions" - with the Bernrieder Kommunderat generally being more restrictive in the case of applications for exemption.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, Turnhallenbau is not a recurring project: "We are not setting a precedent," says Steigenberger.</seg>
<seg id="14">Turnhallenbau at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.</seg>
<seg id="15">The cost is estimated at around EUR 2.3 million.</seg>
<seg id="16">Grants are expected from school and grassroots sports funding.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the next step of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 m hall will now be submitted to the Landrat Office for examination.</seg>

<seg id="1">Peißenberg Clinic moves to Schongau</seg>
<seg id="2">Peißenberg Hospital is expected to be closed earlier than planned - 2016.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes a new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="4">The station and the majority of staff move from Peißenberg to Schongau.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is provided for by the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the Landkreis, which the Councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, a decision on this matter will be taken by the Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board will meet next Wednesday, 23 September.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 staff at the hospital in Peißenberg would be further employed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The vast majority should move to Schongau with Fischer and the remaining interior station.</seg>
<seg id="9">The rooms are there.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jochner-Weiß said: "</seg>
<seg id="11">The staff were informed about the plans.</seg>
<seg id="12">The change has triggered the dismissal of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year, and has now moved to a private practice near the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the question of who will take the succession, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play, who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and switch to Schongau with his team.</seg>
<seg id="14">For the house in Schongau this means in any case a "appreciation" and a widening of the offer in the area of "internal medicine," says Jochner-Weiß.</seg>
<seg id="15">Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.</seg>
<seg id="16">Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the interior station.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the next two years, if the Supervisory Board agrees, Fischer, together with his team, will run both houses until next year, the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, is to be closed definitively in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">Until now, the district had planned this for 2018, when the ongoing rehabilitation at the Weilheim Hospital has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Landrätin Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, met with rumours that the house owned by the Federal Government will henceforth be used as accommodation for asylum-seekers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Jochner-Weiß could not say that there are several considerations.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are currently short-term caritas and day psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="22">"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," says Fischer about the quasi-transfer to the Lech, which was "positive and very understandable" by the staff.</seg>
<seg id="23">There was no real prospect for the house where fishermen have been working as boss for more than 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was asked by Schongauer's colleagues to take over the post of medical director.</seg>
<seg id="25">Peißenberg Hospital (once 100 beds) has been under constant threat of closure over the past decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and birth support.</seg>

<seg id="2">The situation on the German housing market is tense.</seg>
<seg id="3">More and more refugees are looking for affordable lead.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pressure on the housing market is growing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Social housing is facing a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">The distribution campaigns on the German housing market have already begun.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the arrival of refugees and jobseekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.</seg>
<seg id="8">They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.</seg>
<seg id="9">To meet demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the result of a study on behalf of the "Social Housing Confederation."</seg>
<seg id="11">For comparison: This year 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that 140,000 homes are missing.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial residence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Many then enter the housing market and join the long queues before the rental apartments.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the negative development of the housing market is not just due to the increase in the number of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="17">The study also highlights significant shortcomings in housing policy in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="18">Germany is running a housing deficit that is growing year after year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Currently, some 770,000 housing units were missing in the conurbations, and Matthias Günther, author of the study, complains.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many professionals lived in large cities in WG rooms.</seg>
<seg id="21">Young adults stayed in the "Hotel Mama" involuntarily for a long time due to the shortage of housing.</seg>

<seg id="23">To solve the problem, the Alliance of Social Housing proposes a new start.</seg>
<seg id="24">The aim is to revive social housing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thus, basic income tax could be waived and the land tax on subsidised housing could be suspended temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the alliance calls for attractive tax depreciation opportunities.</seg>

<seg id="2">After Hungary, there is practically no passage, as more and more refugees are choosing the way through Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Zagreb announces that it will pass through Slovenia without obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the route is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="5">Croatia intends to agree with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a refugee corridor.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister for the Interior and, if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said the Croatian Minister for the Interior, Ranko Ostojic.</seg>
<seg id="7">Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.</seg>
<seg id="8">The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have fled to Croatia to reach Western Europe from there.</seg>
<seg id="10">500 people had come across the border with Tovarnik, reported the Croatian television channel RTL.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the previous day.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, new laws that came into force on the same day make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="13">Croatia wants the refugees to pass through.</seg>
<seg id="14">Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can pass through and we are preparing for this possibility."</seg>
<seg id="15">These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, they are people who did not want to live in Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the morning, the Croatian police took up the first refugees on Serbia's border with neighbouring Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="18">Most of the media reports come from Syria, Iran, and Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="19">They arrived both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border city of sid.</seg>
<seg id="20">Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not encounter border fences.</seg>
<seg id="22">The border strip poses other dangers: There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="23">Mine cleaners should now quickly create a safe passage.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, after Hungary has closed the border, few more refugees are coming.</seg>
<seg id="25">On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people attacked.</seg>
<seg id="26">Just before the end of Monday it was still 9380.</seg>
<seg id="27">The new Hungarian laws regard overcoming and damaging the border fence as a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="28">35 criminal proceedings have therefore been initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="29">Those sentenced face prison sentences of up to five years and expulsion from the country.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of them - 93 - being the most important transition.</seg>
<seg id="31">Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people.</seg>
<seg id="32">On Wednesday morning there would still have been 40 refugees.</seg>
<seg id="33">In practice, however, no one has any prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Hungarian terms, Serbia is a "safe third country."</seg>
<seg id="35">The rejected asylum seekers should be deported there.</seg>
<seg id="36">Just a few hundred refugees were gathered before the "transit zone" in Röszke.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Röszke, workers began to clean up.</seg>
<seg id="38">They collected the rubbish that tens of thousands of people have left on the streets in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="39">Sperrgitter was dismantled and one of the reception centres in the border town was rebuilt.</seg>
<seg id="40">No one wanted to comment on the aim of this transformation.</seg>
<seg id="41">After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria still has few refugees.</seg>
<seg id="42">The country has also strengthened its border controls.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, according to government figures, around 20,000 migrants remained in the country.</seg>
<seg id="44">In Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for their journey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on instructions from the German authorities.</seg>
<seg id="46">In open-air fishing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.</seg>

<seg id="4">However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail transport with Austria on Sunday because of the influx of refugees, it was in Wernstein, "said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and who, together with two other helpers and their cars, caught up across the border into Passau.</seg>
<seg id="5">Prior to that, we had to swallow the unexpected guests with a snack and drinks.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have just said that we will take them to Passau by car.</seg>

<seg id="9">A man could not take it to hand over a generous donation - EUR 100 for the fire brigade.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We were very pleased," said Stadler.</seg>
<seg id="11">The stranded train passengers had moved from an ICE to Passau on Sunday evening to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that rail transport to Germany was stopped.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:</seg>
<seg id="2">Instead of immediately helping in the Röszke camp to establish structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has, in a highly official and public manner, moved the Hungarian Government's position into the darkness of national socialism.</seg>

<seg id="9">All in all, Konrad expects 85,000 quartz animals per year.</seg>
<seg id="10">To meet the number, 35,000 accommodation needs to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to be made available by the countries, 15,000 by the Federal Government.</seg>
<seg id="11">If there are more refugees, we can do it.</seg>

<seg id="29">The search for a quartier has not yet been successful.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald Trump's ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called donors.</seg>
<seg id="3">This property also connects some with the billionaire that US President wants to become.</seg>
<seg id="4">Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether he speaks out xenophobic, criticises journalists, or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidency boosts the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="6">And it does well.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is also recorded in the pale town of Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.</seg>
<seg id="8">The New Yorker with the Föhnfrisur is a term for many in the winegrowing village on the wine road.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some in the 1200-inhabitant village is more than -zig corners associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="10">His grandfather came from Kallstadt in Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in election campaign mode.</seg>
<seg id="11">The songwriter Simone Wendel wrote a film about Trump.</seg>
<seg id="12">And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?</seg>
<seg id="13">"I think they find this somewhat exciting, but are not so deeply impressed in their urban style," says Simone Wendel.</seg>
<seg id="14">The native Kallstädter has produced an amusing documentary about the place and its famous explosives, including the Ketchup family, Heinz.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in Kings of Kallstadt (2014), saying that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.</seg>
<seg id="16">He did not bring it to the king of the hearts.</seg>
<seg id="17">While there is respect for the family's performance, it also tends to think that Trump is "a bit of a grand mock," says Wendel.</seg>
<seg id="18">Coincidentally, the nickname "The Brulljesmacher" (The Brulljesmacher) used to be the nickname of Kallstadt.</seg>
<seg id="19">So Trump comes from the village of donors.</seg>
<seg id="20">Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold graveyard in the US.</seg>
<seg id="21">The foundation stone of the property group was the first real estate purchases in New York.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: Their desire to return home permanently failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged.</seg>
<seg id="23">He did not accept Trump, because he was once cut off without permission, the director of the Institute of Painting History and Population, Roland Paul, declared the film to be a start.</seg>
<seg id="24">Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant."</seg>
<seg id="25">This contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants.</seg>
<seg id="26">He had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="27">"As the polarized, this is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The Oma was a born Trump, the Opa was born Heinz).</seg>
<seg id="28">The retired winegrowers tend to distance Americans, "he is always so bursting."</seg>
<seg id="29">Does he think Trump will come?</seg>
<seg id="30">"I cannot imagine this," says the 72-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="31">"He never got involved with Kallstadt."</seg>
<seg id="32">The pensioner Veronika Schramm, like many Kallstadter, mentions that a descendent of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally good.</seg>
<seg id="33">"I cannot imagine this from Donald," says the 68-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="34">They would be better if he did not choose, because "he has such radical views, I do not know if that is good."</seg>
<seg id="35">If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the US had been as he would have been, "he would never have arrived there."</seg>
<seg id="36">"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler.</seg>
<seg id="37">And as President?</seg>
<seg id="38">"My President is not," she says.</seg>
<seg id="39">And: "The grapes are ripe without President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="40">Wendel's film, for which Trump has long been interviewed, has seen 12 000 cinematographers, and also in the US is interested.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.</seg>
<seg id="2">Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a wise decision.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some trainers would have banished Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a bargain as the Aussie Rugby League convertible did on his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to make a punt return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reggie Bush.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game.</seg>
<seg id="7">Instead of pressing his Rookies through the chairs before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-match press conference.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his patched catch and take care of the next game.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jarryd Hayne patches at a point restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game</seg>
<seg id="11">It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian follow-up to his NFL debut.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hayne left the field fluently after the fumble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career;</seg>
<seg id="13">"This was a thing that happens, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Free voters are demanding the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="2">Party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn break in Greater Wallstadt against a severe crisis in Bayerns schools when there are not enough new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse," Aiwanger said.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Otherwise, we will have distortions in the Bavarian education system."</seg>
<seg id="4">The district assembly of free voters meets until Friday in the subterranean community.</seg>
<seg id="5">There were actually quite different main issues.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free electorate meeting.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlay the grip," Aiwanger said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as was the case during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="9">"This is no longer the case, we have to address the causes," said the Free Democratic Leader.</seg>
<seg id="10">Rejected asylum seekers want free voters to move as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The FW boss criticized the fact that several Länder were not consistent: "We need uniform standards across Germany."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Bavaria is moving, others are not."</seg>
<seg id="14">"We need to become more effective."</seg>
<seg id="15">But national politics in Greater Wallstadt should not fall under the carpet.</seg>
<seg id="16">A long-term burner remains on the agenda: Education policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the new school year, the Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has launched a pilot experiment "middle-level plus" at 47 secondary schools, during which an extension of the gymnasium is tested from three to four years - as a result, it will take another nine years to finish.</seg>
<seg id="18">But that does not go far enough.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The issue of G9 must be speeded up," said FW chief.</seg>
<seg id="20">We call for freedom of choice for all secondary schools that want it.</seg>
<seg id="21">Free travel at G9 wherever desired.</seg>

<seg id="2">Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber shoots into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rupanläni district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu capital.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of district officials, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you putting stones and fire bombs.</seg>
<seg id="5">MR Dhakal said that the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before they hit rubber shots.</seg>
<seg id="6">20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was not immediately clear why the rubber shoots used, which are known to kill but which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.</seg>
<seg id="8">The dispute was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.</seg>
<seg id="9">There have also been protests in Western Nepal from the Tharus ethnic group who want their own state.</seg>
<seg id="10">At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been violent since 10.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.</seg>

<seg id="1">Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="2">The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is still too early to say whether slightly exaggerated people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Mortality data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote a guide article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5">Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">They reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to feed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient, but most studies have been carried out in people who are ill-health with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered greasy.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach bypass and stomach formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI among those subjected to this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the BMI remained close to 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those who undergo surgical surgery, 36% of diabetes completely eliminated and 28% partially.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the medical-treated group, diabetes completely solved only one percent, and in part only about two percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, the results of controls on blood pressure, triglyceride and the "bad" LDL cholesterol were generally better in the 'surgical' group, the authors found out.</seg>
<seg id="17">Researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hämoglobin A1c is best kept below 7%, write the researchers.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the operation, the average haemoglobin A1c fell from about 9 percent to around 6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, the medical therapy group remained stable at around 8%.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the fifth year, the Bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gastrektomie group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved major drops in the BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and Hämoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was more likely to overcome the 46.4% diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study does not show a survival advantage of surgery after five years, there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Swedish study was about 29% less likely to die over 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have entrenched their bodies with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult. "</seg>

<seg id="3">The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Dalai Lama raised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which deals with ethics studies.</seg>
<seg id="5">He called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents in the circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also stressed that Western European countries "response to the refugee crisis is admirable, but not appropriate to the situation.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to overcome the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Looking after several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, such as real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">We must reduce the use of force.</seg>

<seg id="2">Poison control centres in the US report on an almost 400% increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, says Georgia Poison Center.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of Georgia Poison Center, the cases of revenue from hand disinfectants in children under the age of 12 reported poison control centres rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Children come to these products more and more frequently, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in emergency reception," said Lopez CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mutation of social media.</seg>
<seg id="6">Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.</seg>
<seg id="7">Young people are said to have mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing oral water to get a harder drink.</seg>
<seg id="8">Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.</seg>
<seg id="9">"A child does not think this is bad for it," Lopez said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfected.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapes and orange fragrances that are very attractive to children.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="13">Especially for young children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Giftnotcall Centre at Kansas University Hospital, Fox 4 in Kansa City.</seg>
<seg id="15">So you would not let whisky stand around, but people leave this hand-disinfectant within the reach of children, and when children come to it, it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently took four syringes from strawberry-like hand disinfectant in school, was put into emergency treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk by an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nhaijah lallte her words and was unable to go when she arrived in emergency reception.</seg>
<seg id="19">Doctors watched them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of Hirn trauma, because the girl had fallen through alcohol and got her head, said Ritchey.</seg>
<seg id="20">"This was very frightening," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaiyev's mother, CNN.</seg>
<seg id="21">It could have been fatal for my child.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and store hand disinfectants outside the reach of the child.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with death.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2013, two women died in Ontario after the loophole in hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="25">Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was noted as an active substance.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, three fourth-class students in New York state planned to poison their "common" teacher by designing antibacterial products around the classroom, "he reported a police report.</seg>
<seg id="27">The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectant and banished her from her room.</seg>
<seg id="28">The police considered the thwarted plan to be a "sickness" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.</seg>

<seg id="18">Ronny Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss swung to turn things around.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the defeat against 10-man from Aberdeen, who is now clearly at the top of the table with five points.</seg>
<seg id="20">But Deila said: "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."</seg>
<seg id="21">Now we want to get there as soon as possible.</seg>

<seg id="26">Warburton cautiously in January transfers</seg>
<seg id="27">Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was calling for some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new entrants and insists that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the Ibrox-Kader.</seg>
<seg id="28">The former chief of Brentford said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."</seg>
<seg id="29">The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season.</seg>
<seg id="30">The team is really good.</seg>
<seg id="31">Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.</seg>
<seg id="32">Celtic target Michu with withdrawal document</seg>
<seg id="33">Swansea Stürmer Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period, indicated that he could withdraw if his contract expires with the Swans.</seg>
<seg id="34">The 29-year-old has been plagued with an annoying needle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hearts on SFA Battle stopped for Neilson's Comments</seg>
<seg id="36">The Hearts led 2: 1, when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3: 2, but the Red card of the defense was later lifted - the third red card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.</seg>
<seg id="37">Neilson persists in what he said: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."</seg>
<seg id="38">Griffiths swears to avoid tynecastle</seg>
<seg id="39">The ineffectual Hibee was reprimanded after admitting to have sung a song with offensive texts about ex-Hearts players Rudi Skacel.</seg>
<seg id="40">The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormer and added: "It is certain to say that I do not return to Tynecastle if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow."</seg>
<seg id="42">Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-Management</seg>
<seg id="43">Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's Board of Directors still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline must end on the playing field.</seg>
<seg id="44">I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.</seg>
<seg id="45">We will get the guys back on track, "said Donnelly.</seg>
<seg id="46">McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton.</seg>
<seg id="47">Derek McInnes admitted that his team from Aberdeen had to fight with Hamilton Accies desperately to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooneys Elfmeters in the first half of the table.</seg>
<seg id="48">McInnes said: "There is no team that has won everything, in poker games or leagues that have not won such games."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why I will be witness to an execution in Oklahoma</seg>
<seg id="2">A little later today, with the exception of late legal intervention, I will see a man killed.</seg>
<seg id="3">If it happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will be sitting in a spectator's gallery in Oklahoma State Penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison injection.</seg>
<seg id="4">He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.</seg>
<seg id="5">The invitation was first made in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.</seg>
<seg id="6">When the day came closer, I began to fear.</seg>
<seg id="7">So why should I do it?</seg>
<seg id="8">I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="9">It would offer a unique perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to 5.</seg>
<seg id="12">Anyone who is selected will see it emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="13">I cannot.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will sit alongside Richard Glossips closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit.</seg>
<seg id="15">I like the guy.</seg>
<seg id="16">We often laugh a lot when we speak.</seg>
<seg id="17">The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.</seg>
<seg id="18">I just have to try to remember all the details.</seg>
<seg id="19">A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="20">Here is the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access.</seg>
<seg id="22">I complained to her.</seg>
<seg id="23">She acknowledged that she could have put it better, but she still thinks it is wrong what I do.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and written.</seg>
<seg id="25">He does not tell me what I have to write, and I would not do it, even if he did.</seg>
<seg id="26">I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.</seg>
<seg id="28">When he dies, he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim Bellware, a reporter of Huffington Post, will sit next to me.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.</seg>
<seg id="31">I do not want to go into all the details.</seg>
<seg id="32">I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions following the assassination of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I believe there is a strong likelihood that he will not be guilty of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="36">I believe that his execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And from this perspective I will see him die.</seg>
<seg id="38">I cannot claim to be truly objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">There will be other reporters to whom you can turn.</seg>
<seg id="40">What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.</seg>

<seg id="1">Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to pick him up and threatens to end racing</seg>
<seg id="2">Peter Moody claims that Stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.</seg>
<seg id="3">He aimed at the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's Late Scratching for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive Kobalt-Tupferprobe at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had withheld 18 months on charges of espionage and did not want it to look like too high-hanging grapes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I intended to say nothing about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.</seg>
<seg id="7">You know that it went on.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.</seg>
<seg id="9">I will go home this evening and sleep well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would like to move around the main points raised and I would like my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.</seg>
<seg id="11">If they start to think I do not, then I should not be more trainer.</seg>
<seg id="12">I then have to consider what I do with my license.</seg>
<seg id="13">Previously, Moody had launched the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to pick up his stables.</seg>
<seg id="14">Said Moody on Racing.com.</seg>
<seg id="15">You seem to believe that I am a fraudster.</seg>
<seg id="16">If that is the case, they should certainly take their breath because they have failed in trying to catch me.</seg>
<seg id="17">Robert Roulston, former Chairman of RVL, David Moodie, President-in-Office of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.</seg>
<seg id="18">Should this make me think it will be personal?</seg>
<seg id="19">Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what is happening in the industry?</seg>
<seg id="20">Am I bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="21">Am I so bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="22">Perhaps people outside think I am.</seg>
<seg id="23">Perhaps they have to take my licence and break me, and I have no doubt that what I am saying now makes them think about it.</seg>
<seg id="24">But I have reached the point where I do not care about it, and that makes me sad.</seg>
<seg id="25">That really makes me sad.</seg>
<seg id="26">I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">I have the support of my family and I can go.</seg>
<seg id="28">The frustration levels of the trainer have been built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and Late Scratching has led him to say that he can "throw his license over the table."</seg>
<seg id="29">Moody, best known for his preparation of the unsuspecting master Black Caviar, called the racing day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horses, which contravened the rules.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is against the rules of racing.</seg>
<seg id="31">I must take full responsibility for this, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">"One of my staff mistakenly put mud on the leg.</seg>
<seg id="33">It could have been the case yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="34">It could have been the case all day yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="35">But it also had it on the race day.</seg>
<seg id="36">Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the package on the day of the race.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is a joke.</seg>
<seg id="38">People who lay down these rules know nothing about the horse.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all recognise that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," Moody said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy rebukes Rivalen for allegations of ring-fighting</seg>
<seg id="2">Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has described criticism of Tackling his players as "Agenda Setting" by two Premier League favorites of NRL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney ROOSTERS Trainer Trent Robinson said that the referee allowed the storm player "ring fights" with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely concealed remark about the storm team after his team won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening, calling the game a "model" of the Rugby League and saying that the two from Queensland were not good at the Ringen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy defended the torch of his team and said that they were focused only on their "contact" with Tackling.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team is very much in favour of him, as it meant that they were concerned about being beaten by the Storm team.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This appears again and again - I did not hear Trent Robinson talk about ring battles when they beat us 24: 2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real priority, and that has been the turn for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train, so he is probably not accustomed to losing it, so it was a little shock for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is quite funny, as it always appears at this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne talks about exciting football.</seg>
<seg id="13">He compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting their game was, "said Bellamy.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that St George was criticized in 2010 as a boring team, and Wayne said that he would take care of it.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting, especially his young players at their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of player.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.</seg>
<seg id="18">I am building greater confidence because they say these things because they are a little concerned about having to play against us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago they didn't think of us when it came to big games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against ROOSTERS achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The game of broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game was 20: 18, there were two other attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or are breaks and no points exciting?</seg>
<seg id="24">For me, these are the game plans.</seg>
<seg id="25">When they mention us, it means that we will be meeting them at one stage.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storm team is free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening at AAMI Park.</seg>

<seg id="2">A man who may face a life sentence for his attempt to acquire 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a deposit of $200,000.</seg>
<seg id="3">Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month, after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and was in Coomera in August.</seg>
<seg id="4">Maksimovic was observed as he met his co-defendants in the marina during the morning and later in Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite a possibly life-long punishment for trying to own a commercial quantity of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole crowd and that the café could have been for a harmless reason.</seg>
<seg id="6">The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape from Maksimovic.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has clear relations with Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="8">He often travels to Serbia, "he explained to the court on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the criminal case, he lied the police over his place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $200,000 together to secure his release.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is clear, after reading the insulting statements of the two individuals, that the imposition of security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.</seg>
<seg id="12">But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing, he warned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he gives his Australian and Serbian passport, reports daily to the police and abides by a starting ban of 18: 00-06: 00.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stevan Hogg used the phone of girls to attract paedophile to send images</seg>
<seg id="2">A paedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when he was running, enrolled in an online messaging service from which he received a series of unsteady images of children sent to him by another user.</seg>
<seg id="4">The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping Hogg.</seg>
<seg id="5">She saw it, found the confusing news and immediately alerted her mother.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police took care of this and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "related" web searches that used terms to search for unsteady images of children.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done so, because it would lead to "paedophiles on the Internet" and then "pretending to be a policeman to frighten them."</seg>
<seg id="8">The prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was a addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.</seg>
<seg id="9">He admitted that the searches were carried out by him on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to frighten paedophile.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that he did it to attract them.</seg>
<seg id="12">He said that he was sick when he drink, and said that he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on quote and on wine.</seg>
<seg id="14">She also saw the inconsistent images on the phone and confronted the accused.</seg>
<seg id="15">The girl was interviewed and said that the accused used computers and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he was.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, was guilty, in the sense of the indictment, of having taken inconsistent pictures of children on 14 June last year, of having breached the conditions on 25 January of this year and not appearing in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg should not appear in the register of sexual offenders, because one could argue that "no significant sexual element" can be found in his crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sheriff Alistair Carmichael passed the judgment until October to receive background reports on social work.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.</seg>
<seg id="20">It was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.</seg>

<seg id="7">"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is at the heart of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="9">For the volume model to be sold well, the new Astra should not become much more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="10">Opel offers an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at €17 650.</seg>
<seg id="11">The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Astra has a new 1.4 litre engine with 74 kW / 100 hp.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, Hessen offers further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW / 95 PS to 147 kW / / 200 hp, including three cylinders for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-belt.</seg>
<seg id="15">The second variant will follow in the spring of the Combi, which can already be seen at the IAA.</seg>
<seg id="16">And what will happen to new compact cars next to the Astra on the IAA?</seg>
<seg id="17">Renault Mégane: Renault is launching the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-man in a conventional and highly sporty GT version.</seg>
<seg id="19">He comes to trade early next year, then also as a combi.</seg>
<seg id="20">Infiniti: New in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Nissan boom wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model.</seg>
<seg id="22">The compact Infiniti, with its wound lines, fits fully into the brand's design line.</seg>
<seg id="23">The base model will have a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp.</seg>
<seg id="24">On offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp.</seg>
<seg id="25">Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="26">The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0 litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp.</seg>
<seg id="27">The maximum torque is set at 170 newton meters (Nm).</seg>
<seg id="28">The Baleno will be launched in spring 2016.</seg>
<seg id="29">DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact assembly model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën-Ableger put their hand on the front part: Here the cooling grill was redrawn and the changed headlights were equipped with LED technology.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the interior the infotainment system has been modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple's CarPlay.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, at the IAA in the compact class, there are a number of revisions and new variants such as the freshened Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.</seg>

<seg id="1">JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane</seg>
<seg id="2">The Federal Constitutional Court has given the right to an ex-prisoner of the Tegel judicial establishment, who was housed in too small a cell for months.</seg>
<seg id="3">In principle, prisoners are entitled to financial compensation because of the violation of their human dignity when they are in too small a cell.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the judges, even if only a few days have been locked in the too narrow areas (Az.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14), they can hope for money.</seg>
<seg id="6">This meant that an ex-detainee was successful with his constitutional decree in Karlsruhe: He was housed in a single cell with a surface area of about five square metres in the Berlin-Tegel judicial office between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated.</seg>
<seg id="7">After that, the man who, according to his lawyer, has now been relocated to a larger cell.</seg>
<seg id="8">His seizures for the unworthy conditions of detention against the Land of Berlin failed.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the Constitutional Courts lifted the ruling of the Chamber Court of Berlin and rejected the case for re-examination.</seg>
<seg id="10">They see the human dignity of man being violated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation</seg>
<seg id="12">Even though, for legal reasons, only a few days of detention are essential for compensation from the period in question, there was a right to compensation, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Otherwise, "there would be a fear of a mutilation of personality's legal protection."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chamber Court now has to clarify the level of damage to money.</seg>
<seg id="15">The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.</seg>
<seg id="16">Only in April did they give compensation to a prisoner because he was naked in a cell.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to a 2011 decision, multiple occupancy of a cell without separate toilet is also unworthy of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, on Wednesday, Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 as a humane accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="19">The then plaintiff was in a similar cell for three months daily between 15 and 21 hours, as in the Karlovy Vary case.</seg>
<seg id="20">In recent weeks, the Berlin prisons have also been on the headlines for lack of staff.</seg>
<seg id="21">Prisoners are therefore constantly being locked up for 23 hours, the aggressiveness is increasing, and even crippling is supposed to have occurred because of the tense situation.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to the judicial press office, 21 Tegel posts are not filled because of lack of young people and 19 are expected to disappear in 2016.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We are creating this."</seg>
<seg id="2">Refugee immigration is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it.</seg>
<seg id="3">What happens to Germany?</seg>
<seg id="4">Some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, and according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accept one million refugees.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do it and we can do it."</seg>
<seg id="6">The following overview of what is happening in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimate by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture) and 400,000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments are needed annually - for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is almost twice as much as is currently being built (250000 apartments).</seg>
<seg id="9">What is dramatic, however, is the lack of housing, particularly in the case of affordable rental properties: 60 000 to 80 000 social housing contracts per year are excluded from the fixed rental price, and refugees will also apply for these particularly favourable housing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Federal Minister for Agriculture Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double funding, from the current 518 million to one billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing would have to be created annually, and the Federal Government would have to invest 6.4 billion per year in support for this.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scientists and federal ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to estimates from the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55% of poultry in Germany can be active in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started, but Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation, criticizes Claudia Walter.</seg>
<seg id="15">But it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Work is the key to social contacts, to appreciation in the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political change: The ban on work for refugees to recognise work.</seg>
<seg id="18">While previously there was a ban on the employment of asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence obligation, which restricts asylum seekers to a place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="19">In society, a majority of people have come to believe that refugees should be able to enter the labour market more quickly, partly because of the shortage of skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="21">There has not yet been a sufficient offer of general and professional language courses.</seg>
<seg id="22">Research also shows that jobs are most often mediated through personal contacts.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thus, according to Thränhardt, networking is the royal path to labor integration.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Berlin School Administration has found that few fleeing parents give their children into the kitesurf, an estimated ten to 15%: "For the uprooted parents it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.</seg>
<seg id="25">To convince the family of the benefits of Kita, the administration distributes handbooks in different languages.</seg>
<seg id="26">If the demand for educators were to rise sharply as a result of the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity, for example by allowing more specialist schools.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the countries, students with no knowledge of German will be prepared for teaching in welcome classes.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but also, as in Berlin, by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.</seg>
<seg id="30">The German Studentenwerk estimates that about 20% of refugees want to study in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or tolerated study - the only exception was Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Student-minded refugees could be facilitated access to the university.</seg>
<seg id="33">After all, refugees with a residence allowance or a loan no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Service Act when they begin their studies.</seg>
<seg id="34">In principle, the latter do not receive a bafög because they do not fall within the circle of those entitled to a bavarian.</seg>
<seg id="35">Patient refugees have had to live in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for Bafög, and from 1 January 2016 this range will be reduced to 15 months.</seg>
<seg id="36">This funding gap must also be filled, however, by Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Studentenwerk.</seg>
<seg id="37">Students should receive cash immediately.</seg>
<seg id="38">Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of its identity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as churches, and develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.</seg>
<seg id="40">It would also be important to set up an Islamic charity that takes care of the newcomers professionally.</seg>
<seg id="41">The rights also include obligations.</seg>
<seg id="42">For example, Islam's representatives must agree on clear contact points and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it some control.</seg>
<seg id="43">This includes a willingness to take a bold stand against religious fundamentalism.</seg>
<seg id="44">On Thursday, the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be registered in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">Those who wanted to resolve such conflicts in Germany "immediately have their right to stay here, in Germany," he said in Bayrische Rundfunk.</seg>
<seg id="46">He proposed translating the Basic Law into Arabic.</seg>
<seg id="47">Integration will be much more important than today in society as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="48">This will mean that majority society will also have to change, reducing discrimination and racism will become more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="49">Germany has, for almost a decade, had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law as a result of European decisions.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it learns very slowly, as the NSU series showed, that police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.</seg>
<seg id="51">Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have been demanding for a long time, and what international agreements, such as the Anti-Racism Convention, oblige Germany to do, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and make use of its new citizens - for the benefit of all.</seg>
<seg id="52">In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees that have been expected so far, says German President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="53">"As far as man- power and capacity are concerned, we are creating it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, additional money has to go into the system.</seg>
<seg id="55">In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery asks all arrivals to hand out health cards immediately when registering.</seg>
<seg id="56">Services provided could later be settled with the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="57">And, in the long run, it is highly questionable that so many people should be covered by the limited range of services provided for in the Asylum Services Act.</seg>
<seg id="58">Otherwise, doctors will primarily create language barriers.</seg>
<seg id="59">So far, Berlin's health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are better informed about their diseases than other patients.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is not only in clinics, but also in doctors' practices that interpretation costs should be borne, it demands.</seg>
<seg id="61">But it would also help many refugees with more general medical contact points in emergency ambulances.</seg>
<seg id="62">And with another diagnostic view.</seg>
<seg id="63">Among refugee children, for example, there are much more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV education.</seg>
<seg id="64">However, German doctors would be clear about their training, according to Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="65">"Parasitic or tuberculosis are not so difficult to see." And, as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even see relief.</seg>
<seg id="66">Syrians would have a sophisticated education system, and many refugees would even be doctors.</seg>
<seg id="67">However, in order to be able to practise, they would have to prove their qualifications and perhaps re-examine them.</seg>
<seg id="68">At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are estimated to be mentally ill by the Federal psychotherapy utensils (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.</seg>
<seg id="69">Particularly vulnerable are refugee children, says Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.</seg>
<seg id="70">A recent study by TU München shows that one in five Syrian refugee children are traumatised in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="71">Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called flash backs with respiratory, dizziness, heart attacks and death fears.</seg>
<seg id="72">Other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, strong friction and emotional deafness.</seg>
<seg id="73">Munz explained.</seg>
<seg id="74">So far, however, only four per cent of mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="75">Although psychologically ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in social offices, the treatment usually takes several months.</seg>
<seg id="76">Moreover, social services tend to decide whether therapy is necessary or not.</seg>
<seg id="77">This often leads to misassessments, says Munz.</seg>

<seg id="1">Manege invites you to dream</seg>
<seg id="2">With the new staging "passion," Circus Probesides uses the traditions of circus art.</seg>
<seg id="3">The aim is to draw every age group into the band of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressings and unique entertainment.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the Circus Proverkehr invites you to dream in the mansions on the brick mine.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Our passion is the circus."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I cannot imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Proverkehr, Tierlehrer and Juniorchefin.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Passion" - this is the motto of the current management.</seg>
<seg id="8">For more than 33 years the circus has been in the hands of the Prodorf family.</seg>
<seg id="9">The gift to inspire the family is in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is important for us to get people out of their daily lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours," stresses the 27-year-old junior.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Manegencocktail with world-class flair," says Director Reinhard Progl.</seg>
<seg id="12">50 cities on the 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair.</seg>
<seg id="13">The circus programme convinces with talented artists from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Excellent at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with jokes and charm.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.</seg>
<seg id="16">With the heroes of the silent films it wants to record the Cuban duo loosely.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ease and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="18">Her humorous art at the mast is intended to conquer women's hearts in the storm.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of Circus Progl also fascinates with fingertips and joints.</seg>
<seg id="20">Balance the wheel on a ball?</seg>
<seg id="21">For He Yuan no problem.</seg>
<seg id="22">Schlangenmenschen fascinate and frighten at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like little others and fascinates with their mobility.</seg>
<seg id="24">60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The animals belong to our family," says Stephanies Mother, Brigitte Progl.</seg>
<seg id="26">Abuses in circuses are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.</seg>
<seg id="27">Stephanie Progl also takes a stand on this: "If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well either."</seg>
<seg id="28">About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.</seg>
<seg id="29">The "four-legged artists," as they are lovingly called, will be interpreted by the eyes as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="30">We want to work with animals and have fun with them.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the animal does not feel comfortable, it does not want to fall into the mantle.</seg>
<seg id="32">So the top priority is to ensure that animals are well looked after.</seg>
<seg id="33">Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Ponyhengst and a Zebrastute, the Proverkusen family is proud.</seg>
<seg id="34">The two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing has happened.</seg>
<seg id="35">"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Progl.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Zebroid is not yet ready for the mansions, but it is the unique mascot of Circus Progl.</seg>
<seg id="37">So there is something for every visitor.</seg>
<seg id="38">"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Proverkehr: "No matter if five or 1 200 spectators, we always give our best and are in full touch."</seg>
<seg id="39">From 17 to 20 September the Circus Progl invites you to its performances every day at 17: 00 and 20: 00.</seg>
<seg id="40">On Sunday the programme starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thursday is family day, for the presentation at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced.</seg>
<seg id="42">In addition, the animal inspection is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.</seg>

<seg id="2">MR Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell from a podium at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="3">He remained intact, but the video of the case spread quickly through the social media.</seg>
<seg id="4">The opening of Parliament was also clouded by allegations by opposition Members that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mugabe's speech with his letters.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last month they hired him and interrupted him during his State of the Nation speech in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones that they warned against disturbing Mr. Mugabe's address.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death', he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that immunity ends in Parliament and, once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.</seg>

<seg id="1">FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that team colleagues must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger pointed out to Wilshere that it was not until September, and if his rehabilitation is planned, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four matches for England, and, given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The big shame on this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then rediscovered his old momentum during the previous season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a bone that did not heal well.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is not a major issue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was just an accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not related to his ankle or the injuries he had previously.</seg>
<seg id="10">This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is a risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.</seg>
<seg id="11">It also develops an unpleasant pattern.</seg>
<seg id="12">The investigation by Premier injuries Ltd reveals 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 liga matches in the last five seasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">The broader picture for Arsenal is that, in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08, they were one of the two Premier League clubs that recorded the most infringement days.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes when you come back from a violation, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough to overcome this.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I'm trying to keep the balance and give players who need it a little snap," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although Arsenal is clear favorites to move forward through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most intimidating venues in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dynamo is also unscathed after 41 games, after the "indelible" campaign was launched last season.</seg>
<seg id="25">The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lesson of the past season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with his management.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This drive is immense," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has never crashed at Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="30">We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">FriendsFest: The comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships</seg>
<seg id="2">The absence of similar performances in shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open themselves is now even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year high.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it was the main cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common for men than for women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an effort to address the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of man to challenge culture, preventing men from seeking help when they need it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study by more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery doubled.</seg>
<seg id="7">For those who are not depressive, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">But of course you have to have friends first so that friendship can work.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the age of social media communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the inemployability of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, vibrant and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much more deeply.</seg>
<seg id="12">And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money can really not buy happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which was distinguished by interaction as a friend.</seg>
<seg id="15">The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hues, moments of football in comfortable armchairs and Ross's yearning for Rachel - all of this came from the knowledge that men can always refer to it, even if they often refuse to fully explore their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As one of the telephone service staff told me:... "my listening role for people who feel depressed and are self-defeating has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old saying "I am right" has an enormous impact, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking openly about problems. "</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term redress mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">It clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.</seg>
<seg id="21">As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people at moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so if you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the setting completely redesigned to celebrate the day, why not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, even better if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know what difference your friendship could make.</seg>
<seg id="25">Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest</seg>

<seg id="1">Di Maria meets to help PSG dismantle Malmö</seg>
<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="3">Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to bring it to Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here are the game report and the response to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept their course when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PSG player, who launched the French champion, but then missed a number of opportunities before finally raising their lead when Cavani achieved a headballtor in the 61st minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master, as they want not only qualification for the K.o.s rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="8">But while they got the points, it was not a little game by Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it's a good start to win 2: 0, cause problems to our opponents and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we need to perfect in the course of the season," Blanc said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is a good sign.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not achieved one or two more goals. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which at the weekend could hold a 2: 2 undecided at its own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but was shot out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentine wing stormer was referred to as the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when it was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why, when he entered Marco Verrattis's pass behind Malmö's defense, he went past Johan Wiland's long network.</seg>
<seg id="14">But if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, that was disappointing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was a serious opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field.</seg>
<seg id="16">But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far beyond Kevin Trapps's posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG sometimes abandoned itself, with some mistakes and bad scores, not least by Ibrahimovic, who, in no less than five attempts alone, was patched in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had restarted it.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, he showed much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play, and it was a pass of Ibrahimovic that turned Di Maria into a shooting shot that was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the foot...</seg>
<seg id="19">The second gate finally fell short after the hour brand thanks to Cavani, and the Uruguay won his sixth season gate after Ibrahimovic had caught a left flank from Maxwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">This ended all thoughts that Malmö could return to the battlefield, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland at a very short distance to stop David Luiz, could hold down the final result before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was finally recognized.</seg>
<seg id="21">The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">Skills games are not enough. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Listen to Paris!</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a great game of them!</seg>

<seg id="2">The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which is affected by collapsing commodity prices, gathered $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt redemption plan.</seg>
<seg id="3">Glencore, registered in London, said in a statement that it sold new shares worth around £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.</seg>
<seg id="4">The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices, as China's economic downturn is pushing demand and devastating markets.</seg>
<seg id="5">The issue of rights of reference brought Glencores's share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange on early Wednesday morning.</seg>
<seg id="6">The share spread by 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.</seg>
<seg id="7">Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion share sales as part of the broader plans to pay off around a third of its $30 billion debt.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company sold the new shares to 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the final price on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Concerns about long-term impediments to growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper, and other commodity prices have fallen by 20-40%.</seg>

<seg id="1">Xavi: PEP Guardiola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008</seg>
<seg id="2">World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015</seg>
<seg id="3">The FC Bayern apparently stood a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain's superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="4">Eight times Spanish champions, three times Cup winners, four times Champions League winners, two World Club champions, two times European champions, one time World Champion - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.</seg>
<seg id="5">In summer, the 35-year-old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Katar.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now tells us that he was already in front of the Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Madrid won everything, we nothing," he says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And the FC Bayern also registered this.</seg>
<seg id="10">Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Rummenigge wanted me."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.</seg>
<seg id="13">Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change</seg>
<seg id="14">However, the change did not materialise.</seg>
<seg id="15">And the decisive man is working today for the German record champion: PEP Guardiola.</seg>
<seg id="16">Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EM."</seg>
<seg id="17">"PEP told me that I would not change, that he could not imagine the team without me."</seg>
<seg id="18">"He told me that."</seg>
<seg id="19">Who knows how Bavaria's 2008 / 2009 season had run with Xavi.</seg>

<seg id="1">Matt Damon plays down diversity in film making</seg>
<seg id="2">Matt Damon confronted Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a debate on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a episode of Sunday Night by HBOs Project GreenLight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when he emphasized the need for alternative perspectives, referring to a black protagonist in the chosen screenplay of the project.</seg>
<seg id="4">"When we talk about diversity, you do it when capturing the film and not in capturing the show," Damon assured.</seg>
<seg id="5">Brown reacted shocked, with insulted disbelief and called "Hoo! WoW. Okay," when the commentaries of The Martian's actress were consolidated.</seg>
<seg id="6">Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I would like to call on people to think about how they treat the figure of Harmony," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The only black person, and she is a noose beaten by her white pie.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dear White People's producer stood up for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to govern the film; Damon replied that "in the end her directing could give us something we do not want."</seg>
<seg id="10">After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapproval of Damon's comments.</seg>
<seg id="11">Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip by writing "Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that is SO WEISS that it hurts."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Tweet earned more than 5,000 Retweets and 4,000 Likes since its release.</seg>
<seg id="13">Damon's comments come at a time when accurate racist representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement had an impact throughout the country and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against farmers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Albums still matter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Like books and black life, albums still matter.</seg>
<seg id="18">More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement published a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck as to whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The network Black Lives Matter is a love group," the leaders said.</seg>
<seg id="20">It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogule invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.</seg>
<seg id="21">Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional athlete and operator assistance Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="3">The competition show, which just closed its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the season's final, two men, Caldiero and Cameroon Geoff Britten, managed to finish.</seg>
<seg id="5">The last task was climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was the first athlete to complete the demanding phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior.</seg>
<seg id="7">Caldiero spoke with E! News after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I think it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E!</seg>
<seg id="9">So suddenly.. how I can not even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="10">The leading producer Kent Weed joined The Hollywood Reporters to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, does not receive any prize money.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If there is more than one finalist, he gets the fastest time," Weed said.</seg>
<seg id="13">How much the money is a wonderful price and how life changes, he receives the great congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="14">I do not think he has any resentment.</seg>
<seg id="15">He is just as happy to have done what he has done.</seg>
<seg id="16">He received crowds of awards from fans.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is such a great guy and a family father.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is a hero for his children and his wife.</seg>
<seg id="19">Geoff said to me: "If I should be beaten by someone, I am glad it is Isaac."</seg>
<seg id="20">And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged roles.</seg>

<seg id="1">Detroit Tigers grind past Minnesota Twins</seg>
<seg id="2">MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the past, they were one of the best teams in the Baseball, and today the Tigers are at the last place in the American League Central.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Twins squandered a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard course.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Detroit, if only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word, which was so difficult to grasp over much of the second half of the season.</seg>
<seg id="7">"All victories make fun, no matter how it comes," Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then in the sixth and ninth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Simon (13-9) beat 6 times in the 1 / 3 Innings and enabled three rings.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was only his third successful start in his last nine matches.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I want to finish strongly this year," Simon said.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is difficult to throw any game in the bull, and so I want to go into the game in a very focused way.</seg>
<seg id="13">The designated Tiger Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two ranks, his first round since mid-August.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on 6 July.</seg>
<seg id="15">Said Ausmus.</seg>
<seg id="16">He looked good at (percussion training), looked much better from the bull, and he brought it directly into play.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Twins had their best chance to get back into the game with three rings in the back of the seventh.</seg>
<seg id="18">Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the Inning with a double on the left.</seg>
<seg id="19">Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the Strikeout before he was replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.</seg>
<seg id="20">Hardy overran Wall, the only man he was confronted with, before the designated Rookie drummer Miguel Sano, who crashed a two-run on the right-wing Drew Verhagen.</seg>
<seg id="21">With a pair of runners and the finish run at the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor plouffe to a Double Play.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was the 27th time in the Major League that Plouffe beat a Double Play this season.</seg>
<seg id="23">After Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth Innings, Wall created a RBI double against the clone of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the level of 5-4.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, the right ribbon sano on three pitches for his fifth Save.</seg>
<seg id="25">Detroit benefited at the start of the game from an unmoving Phil Hughes.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Tigers reached three ranks in the first two innings against the right-wing veteran, who had been removed from the injury list before the match, having been missing for more than a month because of a back pain.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Obviously not the beginning I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."</seg>
<seg id="28">After receiving the Leadoff Batter in the first, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.</seg>
<seg id="29">A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez put Victor Martinez into play, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.</seg>
<seg id="30">Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the Scoring position.</seg>
<seg id="31">The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach third, ending the threat.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Tigers settled in the second, achieved a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single of center-field Anthony Gose to the 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="33">"This was a big blow," Twins Manager Paul Molitor said.</seg>
<seg id="34">He did not beat very well, but he caught the right place.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hughes was in a Pitch Count, did not score points in the third Inning before he was replaced by the Reliever right-handed A.J.Achter.</seg>
<seg id="36">At Hughes there were three Runs at six hits and one walk with four strikeouts.</seg>
<seg id="37">Notes: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez left for injury to the sausage.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was studied by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the Sanchez shoulder in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="39">Sanchez, since mid-August on the injury list due to a shoulder distortion, will be activated for the start on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="40">With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the Twins.</seg>
<seg id="41">Norris with 1-1 at four startups with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on 30 July.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has been missing since 20 August because of a crushing in the right-hand hip joint.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three matches in the Target Field on Wednesday</seg>
<seg id="44">Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)</seg>

<seg id="7">It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes at the southern pole of Saturn in 2006, spinning water vapour and ice particles, thereby feeding the so-called e-ring of Saturn.</seg>
<seg id="9">At least on the south pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers closed.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clarified.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.</seg>
<seg id="3">But those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often more likely to be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mangoes contain a relatively large amount of sugar - especially sucrose.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the exotic fruits are healthy: They contain B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. Most importantly, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-beta carotene.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.</seg>
<seg id="7">When you buy, mango should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="8">The shellfish colour alone does not indicate how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very tasty.</seg>
<seg id="9">They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then you can taste pure or sweet food.</seg>
<seg id="11">A mango also gives a special touch to hearty dishes.</seg>
<seg id="12">It mitigates the slightly bitter taste of some leafy salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.</seg>

<seg id="2">Next night, in the valleys of the Val di Föhn, Meteoschweiz announced Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the Föhn blows partly with storm strength by the Föhntäler.</seg>
<seg id="4">After flying on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, bringing powerful rainfall, wind arches and a fall in temperature.</seg>
<seg id="5">As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Islands in a strong south-west current.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the Alpine side, on the night, the Föhn breaks through the valleys.</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result, the Föhn blows up until Thursday morning in the Föhnstädter with arches from 60 to 100 km / h, isolated and, in particular in the Urnerland, partly with more than 100 km / h.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Föhn can penetrate in places to the adjacent Mittelland, on the mountains, even orchards of over 120 km / h are possible.</seg>
<seg id="9">While in the north on Wednesday stormy föhn ensures summertime temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity of the Alpensüdhang begins to burn.</seg>
<seg id="10">Rain is used here until Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="11">In total, the next 48 hours south of the Alps will have to be estimated at more than 100 litres of rain per square metre, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in recent days.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Thursday morning, the Föhn runs out of the air, followed by a cold front with strong, partly tormented rain from west to east via Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="13">Together with the cold front, the wind is soaking up strongly to stormy, and temperatures are falling sharply.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rome now has a Martin Luther Square</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a so far nameless place was baptized on Wednesday in the park on the Oppio hill on the name of the German reformer.</seg>
<seg id="4">In "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognised as a "German theologian of Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="5">The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome next to the Coliseum.</seg>
<seg id="6">The name had been requested by the working group of Protestant churches in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Gospel-Lutheran community in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the Passes could often live their faith as a minority for centuries only in secret.</seg>
<seg id="8">The square symbolizes that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="9">Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent a few months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk around the turn of the year 1510 / 11.</seg>
<seg id="10">He felt the city as a lost scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to historians, his negative impressions may have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome.</seg>
<seg id="12">Luther then initiated the division of the Ablasshandel with his theses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hammer Artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible</seg>
<seg id="2">Jesus with the (gold-plated) queen is one of the main works Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.</seg>
<seg id="3">Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the beginning was the floor?</seg>
<seg id="5">No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motives formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.</seg>
<seg id="7">His "language" with colourful colours and imaginative shapes has been received by the 75-year-old - but this is by no means synonymous with "funny" images.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the contrary, adapted to the respective topics, this may seem rather gloomy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Around three years Otmar Alt worked on his bible project, for which he made a subjective-artistic choice from the many themes of the book of all books.</seg>
<seg id="10">These are cycles that focus on topics such as crossroads, plagues, bids or fatherhood.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has spontaneously fascinated several partners: Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.</seg>
<seg id="12">And then there is the author Klaus Altepost, who dealt with the respective biographies on the basis of painting.</seg>
<seg id="13">He interpreted the biographies selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated into current contexts.</seg>
<seg id="14">These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are embedded between the original bibelzitat of Martin Luther and a set of the artist who formulated here his very personal thoughts on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The jewellery band has golden letters.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus, the 75-year-old immediately allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is a high level of intimacy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born 1940 in Wernigerode and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler order.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The education was done with the pipe stock," Otmar Alt remembers.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I have tried to work on this, perhaps to get back to my father."</seg>
<seg id="22">His second concern is to restore the importance of art in a fast-moving period: "The perception of world of images is now marked by advertising, and that is loud.</seg>
<seg id="23">Symbolism is suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Artists have a different desire and wish to show things.</seg>
<seg id="25">Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In this respect I am a dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="27">Otmar Alt wants the viewer to "fall into" the pictures, let them work, discover and feel the power they have: "The image is looking for his counterpart."</seg>
<seg id="28">Klaus Altepost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of Otmar-Alt-Bibel in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "always" a lover of Otmar Alts art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."</seg>
<seg id="29">Old did not take care to fully capture the Bible, but chose the topics that are important to him, including mysterious ones.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This was not cooperation on an equal footing," Altepost says: "This is about the images, the text explains only."</seg>
<seg id="31">For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."</seg>
<seg id="32">Otmar Alt's pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="33">Part of the originals - paper and painting - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on 15 November at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung.</seg>

<seg id="2">The DFB expands its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga sends out a clear signal at the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="3">Football responds to the worsening situation in Germany and assures the policy of helping to deal with the problems that lie ahead.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I consider this to be our country's greatest challenge since reunification."</seg>
<seg id="5">"In principle, nobody can say that this is not an issue for me, I have nothing to do with it."</seg>
<seg id="6">"This must be of interest to each and every one of us to get to grips with this issue," said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I am in the office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State, Ms Özoğuz, and the Chancellor."</seg>
<seg id="9">"The issue will certainly play a central role," he announced.</seg>
<seg id="10">Football can and will help.</seg>
<seg id="11">But politics must set the course.</seg>
<seg id="12">The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1: 0 for a welcome" for four years.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," said Niersbach in the margins of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's / Malta.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some Bundesligists also support this programme.</seg>
<seg id="15">As early as this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will send a clear signal when they will wear the expression "We help - # refugeeswelcome" on the left side instead of the usual sponsorship logo (Hermes).</seg>
<seg id="16">"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," said Leverkusens Sportchef Rudi Völler of the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and called the project "self-evident."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The refugee drama affects everyone, no one must ignore it."</seg>
<seg id="18">"We football federal ligists can, no, we must use our energy, influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha Manager Michael Preetz.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hoffheims Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the League."</seg>
<seg id="20">On Friday, the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale to participate in the EM qualifying match against Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="21">Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a major community of German football."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is great that all 36 licensing associations have started their own projects in their places.</seg>
<seg id="23">Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active.</seg>
<seg id="24">The message "1: 0 for a Welcome" that we have spent is lived in football.</seg>
<seg id="25">He said.</seg>
<seg id="26">This year and next, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, provides 300 000 euros each for the integration of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The clubs have already picked up the whole amount for 2015," said Niersbach.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany is supposed to be a technological pioneer in changing the car according to the wishes of the Federal Government.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Bundeskabinett adopted on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Wednesday in Frankfurt, Dobrindt spoke of a "new age of mobility."</seg>
<seg id="5">Automated and networked driving would increase road safety and reduce congestion,</seg>
<seg id="6">He will also discuss the issue with his G7 counterparts, who will also meet representatives of industry at the IAA.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Transport Minister's strategy paper highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband development and a rapid shift to digital radio.</seg>
<seg id="8">A test track is currently being developed on the motorway 9 in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order to avoid additional liability risks for the driver, the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework and adapt it to the new developments where necessary. "</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, Germany intends to work internationally to increase the maximum permitted speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Federal Government also wants to promote an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which until now only provides for people as drivers.</seg>
<seg id="12">When driving automatically, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.</seg>
<seg id="13">The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nevertheless, road-users can be expected "well beyond 2020."</seg>
<seg id="16">The authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany to around €8.4 billion for 2025.</seg>
<seg id="17">Said Sören Bartol, the SPD transport politician.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.</seg>
<seg id="19">But Germans still view self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or Americans.</seg>
<seg id="20">A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the Validation Decra, presented on Wednesday at the AA, concludes that only eight per cent of Germans believe that self-driving cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 per cent do not count on it until 20 years, 31 per cent do not believe so at all.</seg>
<seg id="21">In France, 21% of respondents expect self-driving cars by 2025, 33% in the US.</seg>
<seg id="22">In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="23">Following a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to surrender control throughout the journey on all roads.</seg>
<seg id="24">On the motorway, the flow of traffic could be as high as 15%, while in the city it is 45%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Well one in four would under no circumstances leave control to the car.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax-figurative gruselkabinett: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The highlights: Shovel pups that look terribly human thanks to video projections.</seg>
<seg id="4">They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonnas stage outfits - and by putting men in skirts.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I can no longer say today that I am the Enfant terrible of Haute Couture because I have white hair."</seg>
<seg id="6">"In the past it was light, now it is real," said Gaultier.</seg>
<seg id="7">For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From Bürgersteig to Laufsteg), which is to be seen from 18 September in the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is a good fortune that the modesch-wearer has changed his initial opposition to a look at his person.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, he was against it because: "For me an exhibition sounds a bit after death," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">When you die you come to the museum.</seg>
<seg id="10">The impressive collection had already been made in Montreal, Canada, and Paris.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's all about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederer.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.</seg>
<seg id="13">The exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having been trained.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chronologically, the show has not been built, but it is an outstanding choreographic work for which a lot of effort has been made: To freeze the dolls, for example, a stylist has been dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material were carved to Munich.</seg>
<seg id="16">Just before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special sleigh: A leather hose outfit with corset.</seg>
<seg id="17">Heidi meets Madonna.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has always been interested in strong women ("Women are louder than men") and people who are a little different, said Gaultier.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also Gaultiers old Teddy can be seen in the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="20">He stands for the first, timid, fashionable behavior of the designer.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a child (he was not a good pupil and bad in football) he attracted his Teddy BHs and clothes, said Gaultier.</seg>
<seg id="22">Playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents.</seg>
<seg id="23">He then got his own hands on the design of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="24">He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier said in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Later I bought it of course.</seg>
<seg id="26">He could not pay for his first own fashion show.</seg>
<seg id="27">They did not get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.</seg>

<seg id="3">The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers, who, for example, processed them into blankets and garments.</seg>
<seg id="4">That alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Instead, fashion is again important.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the early days of the Plauener Top, fashion played a greater role, was then suppressed by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reinhardt gives some examples: Top in jewellery, accessories like bags and regional costumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the so-called vintage fashion, inspired by past styles, represents an increasing order potential.</seg>
<seg id="9">Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.</seg>
<seg id="10">They already account for half of all orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the Plauener Top and embroidery Association.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only they can wear the protected label.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the last 15 years, around 80% of turnover has disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is almost no longer any private trade or wholesale.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our products hardly reach our customers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Today, mass goods are produced much cheaper in Asia and sold almost exclusively through chains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, exports are weak, currently to Russia and the US.</seg>
<seg id="18">So there are enough reasons for new paths.</seg>
<seg id="19">As Cordula Bauer explains from the Stickperle in Falkenstein, the industry association also tries to point out environmental awareness: "Since this year we have been conducting a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially acceptable."</seg>
<seg id="20">Reinhardt added: "This also applies to the materials used."</seg>
<seg id="21">Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Ausenstelle der Westsächsische Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroideries and tips.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to counter competition from Asia, we need to find high-quality and innovative products.</seg>
<seg id="23">That takes time and courage.</seg>
<seg id="24">There is a field of tension between the freshest ideas of designers and companies, which must think first and foremost economically, "says Schmidt.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, an existing design is often slightly different to keep a customer base.</seg>
<seg id="26">A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revitalized the historic snowball tip.</seg>
<seg id="27">In some places, the machine sticks small cows.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Plauener Goldschmiedemeister Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before I could not start with traditional Plauener Spitz."</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.</seg>
<seg id="30">In a complex process it shapes the pattern in silver.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Many people in the region identify with the theme of Plauener Top - young and old," says Reuter.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also supplies to the US, Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a souvenir.</seg>
<seg id="33">This makes me see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.</seg>

<seg id="2">Legend is it that one is not supposed to touch, but Disney still dawns on a new film by his classic "Mary Poppins."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Entertainment Weekly," however, is not a re-filming, but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical baby girl.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is about the experiences of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.</seg>
<seg id="5">Anyone who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in cinema.</seg>

<seg id="1">XI urges wider opening up the economy to the world</seg>
<seg id="2">President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that a group charged with steering the reform must open up to the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="3">"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-ups strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.</seg>
<seg id="4">Promoting new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, said Xi.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Leadership Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list on market access rules, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital and overhaul of the population reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, said the statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government will also relax controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.</seg>
<seg id="10">The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">An offer to open state-controlled sectors will open up further areas for private investment.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits or the Green Card by optimising requirements and facilitating the application process.</seg>
<seg id="14">The right of lawyers to carry out their work and professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="15">The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.</seg>

<seg id="2">The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large-scale predators, thereby creating a much higher dose of nervous energy for consumers.</seg>
<seg id="3">The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has an EU working paper, strongly criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies will be passed on with full force to pregnant women and young children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values for the nervous poison for large fish are to be raised at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish for "economic reasons," from one mercury per kilogram of fish to two milligrams.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, large-scale predators are already burdened with mercury so much that around 50% of catches cannot be sold on the basis of the remaining limit values.</seg>
<seg id="6">After doubling the limit values, only 14.5% would be unmarketable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In return for this relaxation, according to Foodwatch, the EU intends to tighten the limit values for other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, Foodwatch called this "trick," because smaller gravefish, such as carp, are usually so low that they already comply with the proposed maximum levels.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reduction in small amounts to "a perfidicular diversion that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which accumulates heavily over the food chain, especially in predators.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Federal Government therefore warns that "low levels of damage to the nervous system, especially in case of unborn injuries, can cause."</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment states on its homepage that a "health hazard to the general public" is not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mercury enters the environment mainly through coal burning.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tonnes of mercury per year, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube, was "permanently and comprehensively exceeded," the "mirror" quoted from the paper in March.</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year, Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU's RASFF alert system.</seg>
