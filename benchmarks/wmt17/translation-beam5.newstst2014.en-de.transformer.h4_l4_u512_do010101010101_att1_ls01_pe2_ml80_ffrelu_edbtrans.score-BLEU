It is in-advisable to publish scores from multi-bleu.perl.  The scores depend on your tokenizer, which is unlikely to be reproducible from your paper or consistent across research groups.  Instead you should detokenize then use mteval-v14.pl, which has a standard tokenization.  Scores from multi-bleu.perl can still be used for internal purposes when you have a consistent tokenizer.
BLEU = 28.88, 61.2/34.9/22.2/14.7 (BP=1.000, ratio=1.001, hyp_len=64556, ref_len=64498)
