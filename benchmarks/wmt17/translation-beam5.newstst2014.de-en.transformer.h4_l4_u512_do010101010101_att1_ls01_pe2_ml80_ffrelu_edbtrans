Gutach : even more security for pedestrians
they are not 100 metres apart : on Tuesday in Gutach the new B 33 pedestrian ampel was launched at the village park - within sight of the older town hall ampel .
two plants so close to each other : intent or thyroid ?
that question was clearly answered by Gutach &apos;s mayor yesterday .
&quot; the town hall floor was installed at the time because it secures the school path , &quot; Eckert explained yesterday .
the Kluser @-@ Ampel safe both cyclists and bus drivers and the Bergle residents .
the facility officially operational yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße crushing area .
we have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , doctor and bank as well as traffic flow from the residential area › Grub ‹ .
&quot; with the high traffic and pedestrian levels , another traffic light had to be their safety , &quot; Eckert said .
Peter Arnold also confirms this from Offenburg .
&quot; according to current measurements , on the B 33 daily about 12,000 vehicles pass through the community Gutach , of which about 10 percent are heavy duty , &quot; Arnold points out .
as a result , building another traffic light is more than necessary : &quot; security is just happening here , &quot; according to Arnold .
in total , four traffic views were carried out , and a roundabout was also considered , but due to the mess in the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße crushing area .
according to Arnold , everything was tested at the location of the Ampelmasten : &quot; by means of an extra transport for us with particularly long wooden trunks , we checked out whether these vehicles can drive out of the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without cracking the traffic lights . &quot;
the approximately 15,000 @-@ euro traffic light system itself is the &quot; most modern thing there is currently on the market , &quot; Arnold explained .
the plant is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights can be seen by motorists , for example , even in deep sun .
and sparingly it is : the older light systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .
there are three light systems per ride .
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : it is equipped with two radar sensors .
when the pedestrian hits the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .
if the road is free , it comes immediately green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .
another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be finished for pedestrians .
&quot; should a group or disabled people go across the street , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will surely come across the runway , &quot; Arnold explained .
of course , the motorist must think here as a partner and watch the runway .
this was not the case yesterday : barely showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green , smoked an upper class vehicle - in bright red .
Josef Winkler has been writing the woes of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years .
the disasters of his Catholic villain - the faintness , the slope to raw violence and blunt sexuality , the duck and freudlessness - has often been described by the Carinthian poet .
the prize winner is known mainly as a prosawriter , theatre texts are in his work .
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance &quot; Weather lights on the guild tip , &quot; which can now be seen in garage X at Petersplatz , a collage made of prosatexten .
the theatre designer combines elements of the autobiographical novel &quot; The Leibeigene &quot; ( 1987 ) with saminizes from &quot; Leichnam , his family belauernd &quot; ( 2003 ) .
on the largely empty stage - important props : a cordoned sofa , on which to copy and masturbate - the eight @-@ member ensemble hanged through the text material .
in doing so , director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text .
the 70 @-@ minute performance outpaced the template with a plethora of regimen , known from the repertoire of post @-@ dramatic play forms .
the actresses , in particular , come across the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic changes .
they are grabbed hard , with their head dipped under water , with their evening robes chopped to the wall .
forced into Zellophan or tenant , they staked on dangerously high sticks by staging , either monologizing them loudly or lying completely silent on the stage floor .
however , the text is hardly conveyed in this way .
the best moments have been the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk song .
only towards the end , the overturned performance comes to rest , and Winklers lightened up absurd humour .
a blackbox in the car ?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the sinking highway system , and believe the solution has been found in a small black box that finds space in the dashboard of each car .
the devices , which record every mile and report the information to the authorities , are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state &apos;s planning offices to revise the outdated system to fund U.S. roads .
the normally more boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked intense debate with colorful alliances .
libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups , arguing that the government can use the small boxes to record the miles - and possibly even where they were driven - and then use the information to calculate tax rulings .
the Tea Party is horrified .
the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns .
but while Congress cannot agree on an approach , several states are no longer waiting .
they are currently examining how they can switch to a system over the next decade where drivers pay per driven mile .
thousands of motorists have already tested the tachograph , some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance .
this is really a must for our country .
&quot; it &apos;s nothing we &apos;ll only possibly use , &quot; said Hasan Ikhrata , managing director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments , which plans a record of driving miles among all California motorists in the state from 2025 .
the way we pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , which is funded from the taxes paid by U.S. dollars at the Zapfsäule , is bust .
but in America , no more is danced as much as before .
cars consume less petrol .
the government oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not risen for 20 years .
politicians do not dare to raise the tax by a penny at high fuel prices .
&quot; the petrol tax is just not sustainable , &quot; Lee Munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota , said .
his state has recently equipped 500 cars with driver drivers to test a miles @-@ based pay system .
&quot; this represents the most sensible alternative in the long term , &quot; he said .
bureaucrats call it a miles @-@ based user fee .
it is not surprising that the idea is resonating with urban liberals , because the tax could , for example , be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate @-@ friendly exhaust gases are reduced .
California planners are relying on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious , legally anchored goals of the federal government on climate change .
but Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also said he sees it as the most viable long @-@ term alternative .
the free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also tempted by the idea of having drivers pay for their return route .
&quot; this is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , &quot; explains Adrian Moore , vice president for guidelines at Reason .
people pay directly for what they get .
the move is also backed by two former American transport ministers who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move toward miles @-@ based billing .
the U.S. Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year that would have included 10,000 cars .
but the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the offense , responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas representing people who often have to move many miles on their way to work or town in everyday life .
several states and major cities are nevertheless moving in this direction .
the most committed is Oregon , which currently acquires 5,000 drivers for the country &apos;s largest experiment .
these drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the petroleum tax to the state .
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .
new York City is also considering such a thing .
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks .
and the I @-@ 95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the East Coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is currently investigating how to introduce the change .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently fitted with the devices , motorists were skeptical about the idea the government could pursue any of its movements .
&quot; concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem , &quot; explains Alauddin Khan , head of strategic and earnings management at Nevada &apos;s Department of Transportation .
people didn &apos;t want it .
when the test started , Nevada &apos;s ACLU warned on its website : &quot; it would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into grown @-@ up surveillance devices . &quot;
there is no need to build a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology with which the state can capture the driven kilometres , but not exactly when and where .
with that , Khan said , the public would also be more reassured .
the hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .
the company originally did not step in to help states tax motorists .
rather , it was their goal to take root in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers are to pay on the basis of the driven miles .
but the devices it tested are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information regularly uploaded by modem .
&quot; people are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , &quot; explained Ryan Morrison , managing director of True Mileage .
major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes .
there are far cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .
in Oregon , planners are experimenting with giving motorists a number of choices .
you can choose a device with or without GPS .
or they choose no device at all and instead pay a lump sum fee based on the miles travelled by all residents of the state .
other bodies hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than with few .
in New York City , transport officials want to develop a tax device with which parking charges can also be paid , insurance must only be paid for driven kilometres and speed data from other vehicles in real time , allowing motorists to avoid congestion .
&quot; motorists would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits the system offers , &quot; said a planning document from the city .
however , some transport planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction .
at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area , officials said Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising fuel tax .
an additional one @-@ off fee or annual levy could be imposed on motorists using hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so that they too pay a fair share .
&quot; there is no reason for surgery if an aspirin is enough , &quot; explains Randy Rdefler , the head of legislation and public affairs at the commission .
if we do , hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and numerous other things .
Royal field : small team beats wacker
the volunteer fire brigade handled her nursing test despite staff shortages with Bravour .
only 11 men took part in the exercise .
in his exercise , the department commander Hans Kammerer sought out the estate Feder in Burgberger Strasse .
a short shutter should have been created there .
two people were injured by the onset of fire and smoke , but one was still able to send an emergency call .
two responders of the Wehr were prepared to enter the building after the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer .
after a short period of time it was possible to find the first person and go to the open .
the second person had to be worn .
this was not so easy , since a narrow staircase was also to be overcome .
the building , a workshop with integrated stables for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it shifted a lot of wood and also straw buns into it .
there were also electric machines for wood processing .
the first extinguishing attack took place over the tank in the vehicle .
another run took place over a flood hydrant at about 100 metres .
now three solace attacks have been designed .
a hollow tube was also used in the building .
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise to show what to expect with little available staff .
in case of an accident , support will be provided via the Königsfeld daily intervention group .
the commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .
networking of universities and firms important
on his visit to the district of Breisgau @-@ HochSchwarzwald , country president Guido Wolf also made it clear in Titisee @-@ Neustadt where tomorrow &apos;s workers come from .
he went on to discuss this important issue with the business leaders of professional schools , the district gymnasium and the parents &apos; board .
&quot; education is an important location factor , &quot; underlined Claudia Stausle , director of Hans @-@ Thoma School , who presented the interconnected school project Education Centre High Black Forest .
Wolf was impressed by the training model projects .
since 2011 , there has been a successful collaboration between support centre , district gymnasium and vocational school .
he also praised family friendliness in the county .
&quot; it is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also because of demographic change the phase around caring for loved ones , &quot; Wolf explained .
he also suggested that more and more employees were concerned about the care and care of their loved ones .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the working relationship , &quot; Wolf said .
but no one can afford to lose qualified labor , he said .
another particularly important factor is networking universities and businesses .
&quot; for those who have already met the benefits of the region during their studies , with their acquired knowledge and skills , are often given to the regional economy , which contributes to the strengthening of the region , &quot; the president of the country expressed his conviction .
only if sufficient apprenticeships were offered can the specialist needs be met .
in his opinion , the region &apos;s location advantage is its advantageous location in south @-@ west Germany , close to France and Switzerland .
he also experienced the efforts already made to develop public transport on his train journey from Titisee @-@ Neustadt to Freiburg .
&quot; stay stubborn and ensure that public transport becomes better , &quot; he explained to local politicians present .
with music experiencing an entertaining afternoon
for 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting the dietinger seniors to coffee , cakes and then a Vesper .
earlier , the elderly were bemused in the rust .
meanwhile , this afternoon will take place in the nursing home of St. Josef .
the home residents were joking at the delicious cakes and gowns .
later there was root salad .

the above @-@ 100 @-@ year @-@ old natural stone wall as the front line of the old school house on Kirchstraße is to be reinstated on the town of Bräunlingen .
in the days before the kilo , a small wind wall was built into the first work of the reconstruction of the front school , to stabilize and static discharge of the stone wall of natural stone over a hundred years old with balustrade .
according to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Municipal Building Office , the National Monument Office will be involved in the planning process and a remedial approach to the old wall .
a cost calculation will then be carried out by experts , who will then be put on the table to the local council to decide and determine the way forward .
a decision on this is expected to be taken next year .
after the refurbishment , pavement and tree planting of the old school house within the two side wings of the school built in 1912 , it is necessary in the foreseeable future , as a follow @-@ up measure , to renovate the remedial border wall and to put it on new subconstruction .
the historic , one hundred @-@ year @-@ old wall of the old school house to the Kirchstraße , is mainly due to water and frost damage , as there is no drainage , needs to be remedied and has a bow tendency forward .
deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage , but the wall is not currently invading .
a stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students using Schulhof , which has been done through the current fortifications .
originally the school board was planned even in 2008 / 2009 , but high unscheduled spending brought a shift .
an important word in the historical school building , which has even been used for footage , will be the National Monument Office .
should guidelines come from this side , the city of Bräunlingen is hoping for grants from the think @-@ tank .
the students of the Bräunlinger Elementary School , which is now back in a well @-@ restored old school building with new auditorium , can soon use the old schoolyard .
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
in the ongoing discussions about the future of music colleges in Baden @-@ Württemberg , Cem Özdemir , Federal President of the Greens , has now become involved .
&quot; I think it &apos;s wrong to give up holistic training at the music school Stuttgart , &quot; Özdemir told the &quot; Stuttgart News . &quot;
jazz and classical music are part of the jazz venue in Stuttgart .
this contradicts Özdemir , who is considered a favorite for a direct mandate in the federal election on September 22 , the Green Red National Government .
on the basis of an expert study , this will push for a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
the aim is to shift jazz and pop from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim .
us border : &apos; super tunnel &apos; to drug smuggling discovered
at the border between Mexico and the US , investigators have discovered and shut down a &quot; super @-@ tunnel &quot; to drug smuggling .
as the US customs authorities reported , the more than 500 @-@ metre tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , rail tracks and a ventilation system .
three suspects were thus arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .
according to the data , the tunnel had not yet been used .
&quot; these cartels are stupid if they think they could dig themselves under the radar , &quot; the Attorney General of the U.S. District of Southern California , Laura Duffy , said at a news conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego , where that had discovered an end to the tunnel .
contacted the drug gangs , Duffy asserted : &quot; if you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of dirty money . &quot;
both the U.S. authorities and Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against drug cartels .
more than 7,000 people have been killed in Mexico since 2006 in connection with drug crime .
constructed by experts
because of the tunnel &apos;s elaborate equipment , investigators assume it was constructed by architects and engineers and that construction took place around a year .
the track system was so equipped that electric cars could be used there .
on the Mexican side , access lies in a building 80 metres from the border .
according to authorities , a ladder leads 20 metres into depth to the actual tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross @-@ section of 1.20 metres height and 90 inches width .
it would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the US .
two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .
the third , a Mexican , was captured because of the seized marijuana .
all three face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment , officials said .
eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006 , the San Diego press conference said .
however , it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such tunnel construction .
normally , cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities rather than tunnels .
this shows the &quot; despair &quot; of drug gangs whose traditional routes have since been cut off , said Bill Sherman of the drug investigation DEA in San Diego .
they would do all they can to enter the US .
no details were announced on the arrests , at least one was Mexicans , it said .
you have to face prison sentences of up to 10 years .
2014 Geisinger Festival Year
the anniversary of the city of Geisingen at 1250 .
return of the first landmark mention is getting closer .
if in well eight weeks the year comes to an end , the anniversary year is due .
violins and churches were first mentioned together in 794 .
a certificate has been produced in churches where both places are mentioned .
on 15 March there will be an official kick @-@ off for the anniversary year , and since Geisingen currently has no hall , this kick @-@ off event will take place in the place where 1250 years ago both were mentioned for the first time , in churches @-@ Hausen .
a number of events are planned in both Geisingen and Churches .
church Hausen will be the 1250 in July at a festival weekend from July 18 to 20 .
revival celebrate .
on Friday with a ceremony , on Saturday and Sunday with a celebration around the church hall .
at the end of the festival there is also the Church of Churches .
city music director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be performed on three dates .
on 21 June , together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Association , on 12 July at the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new festival .
this will be completed and inaugurated in the Jubilee Year , the official date is September 27 and 28 .
a new chronicle will be released at the Geisinger City Jubilee .
&quot; however , it is intended to become a chronicle not only of violins themselves , but a printed work about today &apos;s vultures , which consist just of violins , church hauls , Leipzig ferdingen , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen , &quot; said Mayor Walter Hengstler .
and today &apos;s vigilante also celebrates 2014 birthday , in 1974 today &apos;s spacecraft was completed with concussions .
the new chronicle is to be presented in the new detention hall on 21 or 22 November .
but 2014 is also another year with many anniversaries .
the Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a brewing evening on the occasion of her 60 @-@ year existence , the harmony Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has the fixed banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May .
the Altenwerk Leipzig is 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May , the music association Polyhymnia Leipzig ferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the Brunnenfestes from 4 to 7 July .
the city of Geisingen was first mentioned in 764 in a gift certificate owned by the St. Gallen monastery .
the certificate was produced in churches ( Hausen ) which was the place of justice at the time .
both communities are therefore mentioned in the same certificate .
to celebrate this 1250 @-@ year @-@ old accordingly is another 40 @-@ year @-@ old town .
Council targets track equipment
should the railway crossing &quot; Am Hirschen &quot; be extensively rebuilt to increase traffic safety ?
yes , the local councils have decided .
for this , Schiltach must take in EUR 220 000 .
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year .
in particular , safety at railway crossings is to be increased - regular collisions of trains with other vehicles occur nationwide .
if communities agree to the reconstruction measures , they must participate with a third in the cost , the rest share rail and the federal government .
Schiltach city builder Roland Grießerin explained to the local council the specifics of the &quot; Am Hirschen . &quot;
there , the city plans to build an outlet at the height of the tunnel in the west of the railway line .
larger vehicles , such as those transporting Langholz , could also stand in counter @-@ traffic , without having to block the tracks .
Greek farmers therefore proposed to construct a necessary base wall to allow the city to widen the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .
this was controversially discussed in the local council as some councils questioned the need for street proliferation : Thomas Kipp , with his statement , brought critics &apos; mood to the point : &quot; do we have to take so much money because of so few vehicles ? &quot;
Mayor Thomas Haas echoed : the railway crossing &quot; Hirschen &quot; is regularly used for landing gear .
even wood from the &quot; Kuhbach &quot; area is partly transported across this route because up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the track at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road .
in addition , the track dived as a redirection for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .
it is clear that Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel would have to be rebuilt and reconstructed , as is currently the case in Wolfach , that the railway crossing &quot; Am &quot; Hirschen &quot; could also be important for a longer period of time .
the councils agreed to investigate what costs would cause the planned broadening of the road .
despite this , a majority of people agreed to the conversion of the railway route , provided that the necessary support wall was built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road towards &quot; Bahnhofstraße &quot; to around 5.5 metres if necessary .
on the other hand , the conversion of the railway route to Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a very different problem , which concerns access to the rapidly rising &quot; Geroltzhäuser Way . &quot;
the administration had been investigating the railway &apos;s conversion plans from the engineering firm Breinlinger as it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Wegs would be possible without further notice .
the investigation concluded that it was not possible to exclude that the road &apos;s inclement conditions could lead to longer vehicles sitting up .
the city is responsible for this .
the restructuring could therefore result in liability disputes .
since both the logging and the bending worked in the current state of construction , you should not agree to the conversion of the railway , Haas argued .
at this point , too , the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than at the other railway crossings , because it is directly next to the halfpoint center to which there is good visibility .
even trains from the main railway station would have to be slowed down at this point to the extent that no collision was threatening .
a majority of people refused to restructure this route because the city of Schiltach would have to &quot; bathe &quot; the problem with stationary vehicles , the councils said , as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the construction works were completed .
as unproblematic , the panel considers the conversions to the &quot; Before Heubach &quot; and &quot; Before Kuhbach , &quot; for which cross @-@ border agreements have already been reached by rail .
ESA decides on big space missions : missions for billions
distance planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects they want to launch over the next few years .
thirty proposals were available and five are still in the race .
distance Worlds .
more than 1,000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers .
whether there is life at least on some of them , no one knows .
the selection is difficult : should you look for gravitational waves ?
or rather explore the origin of the cosmos ?
or , after Earth @-@ like planets , and perhaps discover alien life ?
these are the questions that the European Space Agency is responsible for .
for their Cosmic Vision programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to make research a decisive contribution .
the budget for such &quot; L missions &quot; is approximately EUR 1 billion each .
the launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .
at the beginning of September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
thirty ideas were under discussion , and five of them have now come to the closer election .
many bodies understand the proposals , while researchers are concerned .
in the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee .
a total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa , on which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme launched in 2007 should be answered .
what are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives ?
the exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and hence the emergence of planets that surround these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .
a large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark .
and if a star has planets , under what circumstances can life emerge there ?
in order to address this issue , the space telescope &quot; Cheops &quot; is to be launched in 2017 , with 500 already known planetary systems in our near vicinity .
however , the possibilities are limited , Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros .
with larger instruments , astronomers could map Earth @-@ like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases considered to be an indication of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this question , too , is ultimately intended to clarify the conditions for the creation of life .
a key role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field , as well as the particle radiation it produces with the planetary system .
in our solar system , these processes can be examined in an exemplary manner .
with the Solar Orbiter , the Esa has already approved a M @-@ class mission ( where the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .
the probe is expected to launch in 2017 and closely monitor the sun &apos;s surface and activity .
of great interest to researchers are Jupiter and his moon .
they want to find out what role the giant planet played in developing the solar system .
for this , the Esa provides the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision program .
the probe &quot; Juice &quot; ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to begin its journey in 2022 .
eight years later , she reaches Jupiter to study the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moon of Europe , KALLISTO and Ganymed .
what are the fundamental physical laws of the universe ?
the world offers many ways to study subject matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws we know are still valid there .
perhaps there are also deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory under which all known natural laws can be combined .
how did the universe emerge and what is there ?
13.7 billion years ago , our cosmos emerged through the Big Bang .
in addition to the subject we are familiar with , stars , planets and creatures like us , there is Dark matter , whose gravity is holding galaxies and galaxy clusters together , and Dark Energy , which accelerates the expansion of the world .
so far , researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the Big Bang , nor what dark matter and dark energy exist .
with &quot; Euclid , &quot; the Esa has already approved an M mission to launch 2020 .
with a special telescope , the probe is intended to examine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky , thus allowing for references to the nature of Dunkler matter and Dunkler energy .
who could make the race
of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .
according to many experts , &quot; E @-@ Lisa , &quot; an ambitious concept for detecting gravitational waves , has the best chance of obtaining an L mission .
among them , physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .
they have not yet been proven .
Elisa could create that , the scientists hope behind the project .
the mission provides for one out of two or three probes existing detector stationed in space .
in contrast to plants on Earth , he could also prove gravitational waves that arose during the Big Bang , providing new insights into the evolution of the cosmos .
four other proposals still compete for the second L mission : a large X @-@ ray laboratory called &quot; Athena , &quot; which is to explore black holes among other things , &quot; Icy Planets , &quot; another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , &quot; Prism , &quot; is to investigate a mission to measure cosmic background radiation , and &quot; Finlandes . &quot;
there are already proposals for the transport of samples from Mars , for the exploration of moon , Venus and asteroids and for solar physics .
Snowden ready to &quot; cooperate &quot; with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has said he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities .
German MP Hans @-@ Christian Flubele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany .
in a letter from Snowden presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , he writes : &quot; even though the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a filibuster and tries to criminalise political expression with criminal threat in which no defense is possible . &quot;
but to say the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the international community &apos;s support could convince the American government to drop the charge against him .
the charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property .
German Interior Minister Hans @-@ Peter Friedrich said on time online : &quot; if Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives , we will find ways to make that happen . &quot;
relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has dropped Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s mobile phone .
Thomas Oppermann , the MP who chairs the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service , said that we should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if this is possible &quot; without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US . &quot;
currents , an MP for the Greens , released a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .
he was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .
Flubele explained that according to the lawyer for former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he leaves the country .
if Snowden testifies in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is &quot; safe &quot; there , according to the MP .
Snowden explains in his letter that he was facing a &quot; serious and ongoing &quot; persecution campaign that expelled him from his home .
however , he is touched by the global response to &quot; my act of political expression . &quot;
citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians - including in the United States - have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a credit to the general public .
in his letter , Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation &quot; when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . &quot;
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 from passengers who want to dump hand luggage on their flight .
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even if in the announcement on Wednesday to read that passengers should keep the whole can .
the new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage box above the seat , small bags under the seat remain free of charge .
Frontier explained that you calculate $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 for travelers who paid only at the flight &apos;s height .
frontier spokeswoman Kate O &apos;Malley said the fee of $ 100 aims to encourage travelers to take care of the payment in advance .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to calculate that amount , &quot; she explained .
airlines began charging for the first and second items of luggage in 2008 .
passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore stamped as much as possible into the hand baggage , which means that the luggage bags are often overcrowded over the seat .
fees are one way to encourage passengers to take less on board .
O &apos;Malley said that at the new fee , it &apos;s not really about making money .
it &apos;s about Frontier &apos;s most loyal customers , who would have clearly expressed that it &apos;s getting harder to find space in the compartment above the seat .
passengers who buy your tickets on the airline &apos;s website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger at Frontier &apos;s airstrip may be allowed to take a piece of baggage free of charge , but the next person will have to pay $ 100 for a similar piece of baggage .
O &apos;Malley explained that Frontier &apos;s website and check @-@ in procedures would be changed so passengers would be informed about the fee before they would go to the airstrip .
Frontier &apos;s new hand baggage charge will enter into force only in the summer , a precise date is not yet available .
passengers often flick over baggage charges and other charges , but airlines like to resort to it .
they argue that transporting the baggage should cost money and passengers should pay that service if they wanted it .
many on Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
however , most leave the fingers of charges for hand luggage so far .
spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first charge for hand baggage and later followed Allegiant Air , also a convenience store .
the only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air , said airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who is closely monitoring the additional charges .
he estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand baggage charge Spirit is $ 50 million a year .
Sorensen , who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines , has recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what would expect him at the airstrip if passengers were confronted with the company &apos;s unusual hand baggage charge .
&quot; the boarding process was among the most smooth I experienced in my career in aviation , &quot; he said .
I expected to see teeth and tangible discussions at the airstrip .
&quot; the plane was full , &quot; he explained , &quot; and the boarding ran like shuttered . &quot;
Frontier also follows Spirit at the $ 2 required for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .
the company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and add coffee for free .
water remains free .
us Airways had been short @-@ lived in 2008 trying to demand money for soft drinks , but reversed it seven months later after passengers complained and no other major company was trailing .
frontrunner step to charge for hand baggage if passengers don &apos;t buy directly at the airline is the latest initiative to steer customers to their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold .
this gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to direct purchase at them rather than via an online travel agency .
however , Frontier has gone the furthest in this area .
in September , the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency .
on Wednesday , miles were cut again to 25 per cent of the flight route .
a flight flight booked at a third party with Frontier over 1000 miles will therefore only bring customers 250 miles .
passengers can also reserve seats only at direct purchase on Frontier &apos;s website .
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .
the proceeds fell 9 per cent and flight capacity shrank just 13 per cent in the first quarter , as read in the financial report released Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .
Republic has tried to control Frontier &apos;s finances as part of the sale of the Company .
sayings come from the Bible
well 40 women visited the last women &apos;s breakfast this year in the evangelical parish of Bisingen .
the theme of the day at the municipal house were &quot; sayings from the Bible &quot; and &quot; speeches from the Middle Ages . &quot;
Zita Köhler , the chairman of the church council , went after breakfast in a lecture on the biblical sayings .
&quot; sayings contain lifestyles , regulations or warnings , &quot; she explained .
she compared several sayings with the corresponding Bible posts and explained the importance .
she called sayings like : wooden eyes are alert , as scales fall from the eyes , an eye on someone who gives her the Lord in sleep , wash his hands in innocence .
several times the speaker also advised their listeners what the saying was .
the speech from the Middle Ages was adopted by the church commander Christel Dehner : of all good things are three , blue , a little scary .
she explained the importance and origin of the speech she called &quot; bridges to the past . &quot;
in conclusion , a tombola was lost .
prices were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before being handed over to the winners .
among the visitors to the breakfast round , mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger also failed .
learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for unskilled tourism
at the Mecklenburgische Seenplate , a pilot project for the tourism industry was launched .
under the leadership of the Federal Labor Agency , 49 women and men who already work as unskilled in the industry are expected to be qualified for specialist staff for hotels and restaurants over three winter .
&quot; what &apos;s new is that the six @-@ month courses end with degrees , &quot; said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg work agency .
the benefits are varied : participants would not be unemployed , firms trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .
the project also includes the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Gaststättenverband ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
NSA declares that an &quot; internal error &quot; and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the site
the shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake paralysed its public website for a few hours and not hackers , as claimed online .
&quot; NSA.gov was unavailable for some hours this night as an internal error occurred during a planned update , &quot; the spy agency explained in an e @-@ mail message .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the breakdown was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .
in the early evening hours , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unreachable for at least six hours and this remains unavailable to some users .
earlier , a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the authority &apos;s sensitive internal network was &quot; in no way compromised . &quot;
secret information is not in danger , according to the spokesman .
at least one group of hacking activists took charge of paralyzing the NSA website with a DDoS attack .
in case of such attacks , the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .
cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system .
the former supersecret NSA , whose nickname was once No Such Agency ( No such authority ) , now finds itself in the bright light of the public and looks after the revelations in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad - a result of the secret NSA NSA data released by Edward .
the growing controversy surrounding the intelligence service sparked initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation .
slightly down , the number of people without a job in October fell 22 to 1,307 .
while the rate is 3.1 per cent better than last year and also better than in September , &quot; we would have hoped more , &quot; says Monika Field @-@ Bauer , deputy managing director of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen .
many businesses have responded to attitudes so far .
one reason for this is according to the fields farmer : &quot; we have few skilled workers in the craft industry , healthcare and care for the elderly . &quot;
since September , employment opportunities for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been running again .
the winter season begins in mid @-@ December .

profit plunge at Bombardier after drop in delivery numbers and orders
Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit on Thursday after being pressured by declining orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the rail sector .
Bombardier , based in Montreal , also released no flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September .
only three more starts have been followed by the maiden flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago , which makes it questionable whether the test phase will take place as planned .
the results fell short of forecasts , leading to a fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .
Cameron Doerksen , analyst at National Bank Financial , on Thursday cut his valuation of &quot; outperform &quot; on &quot; sector performance &quot; in view of the stock &apos;s limited price potential over the next one to two quarters .
&quot; while weaker delivery numbers on aircraft were expected as much as possible , we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector , &quot; Doerksen said in a customer letter .
we believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the aircraft progresses .
however , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft will catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .
the first test plane was presented to the public in March and flew to the public for the first time in September after months of delays .
but so far binding orders for the CSeries are moderate with 177 as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company &apos;s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost @-@ saving potential of the new jet transport aircraft are accurate .
there are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
chief executive Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet .
the company &apos;s management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program is in the schedule .
&quot; the test plane is no longer on the ground than expected , &quot; Beaudoin said at a conference call and added that during the plane &apos;s standoff , ground tests and software updates were scheduled .
each manufacturer plans differently .
we decided to take a first flight and then mount an overprocessing period , which we did .
this is happening throughout the flight programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining one shortly after , it said from the company side .
still , analysts remain skeptical about whether 12 months after the maiden flight , the first customer can launch a CSeries plane .
Bombardier said it is reviewing planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and will update it in the next few months .
&quot; the slow progress of the flight test - even if they obviously correspond to BOMBARDIERS internal planning - reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015 , &quot; Doerksen said .
in the third quarter ended September 30 , BOMBARDIERS net profit fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share , from $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share , the year before .
adjusted earnings per share are unchanged 9 cents .
sales dropped slightly , falling from 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion .
analysts had expected a gain of 10 cents per share and sales of $ 4.56 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
the world &apos;s fourth @-@ largest aircraft maker announces it has delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a drop of 57 last year .
net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .
the order book in the aerospace sector was $ 32.9 billion on September 30 , unchanged from December 31 .
&quot; in the aerospace sector , the results were within our specifications , but the low order intake and market conditions overall were disappointing , &quot; Beaudoin said .
sales in the aerospace sector fell 13 percent to $ 2 billion .
Bombardier , the world &apos;s largest rail manufacturer , announced that sales in this division have risen by just 11 per cent to $ 2.1 billion .
the order book in the transport sector was $ 32.6 billion on September 30 , slightly increased from December 31 .
the profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by resolution problems in some large contracts .
according to management , there will be new guidance for the fourth quarter .
in afternoon trading Thursday , the Bombardier stock shed 8.5 per cent and was at 4.83 Canadian dollars after also announced that Google &apos;s chief financial officer Patrick Pichette will switch to the board .
Brazilian Embraer SA , the world &apos;s third @-@ largest commercial aircraft maker and BOMBARDIERS closest rival , reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday .

cocaine @-@ dependent lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must go to prison
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave information to underworld figure Neil Scarborough
the lawyer was afraid his home drug addiction could come to light
he was sentenced by Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison
a well @-@ known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be revealed has been sentenced to three years in prison .
Basharat Ditta , 42 , provided underworld figure Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his activities in drug trafficking after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction .
the lawyer , hailed by criminalists as a &quot; first @-@ class &quot; lawyer with the nickname &quot; Bash , &quot; was arrested in his house in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough , whom he had represented in an earlier drug trial .
officials watched as Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine at the attorney &apos;s home in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the Bar Association .
the investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after traces of cocaine were found in his hair , on his wallet and on credit cards .
over an eight @-@ month period between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .
all four suspects were then monitored by police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .
along with 32 other people , they were later arrested after police secured heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5 million as well as £ 200,000 in cash during a series of house searches .
ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could be publicised .
today Ditta , who works for the firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool Crown Court after a three @-@ week trial in two charges of obstruction of justice .
he admitted cocaine possession at an earlier survey .
the lawyer was transferred after police found out in their investigation into Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .
two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta &apos;s house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the attorney &apos;s garbage .
shortly after he delivered the drugs , Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta , who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park at dinner .
the lawyer returned home , took the drugs and then exchanged nine communications between the two .
in court , it became known that Ditta was a &quot; regular consul &quot; of cocaine after drugs from Class A were discovered in his hair , his wallet and on his credit cards .
ditta was later arrested but denied taking cocaine and said he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client , claiming that her discussion was subject to &quot; legal secrecy . &quot;
during his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were assured and he was taken out of a hair sample .
at the police interrogation , he admitted that he entered an office and clients at home for legal matters , both under his private address and in the workplace .
in court , it was announced that he had called key players in the drug trade , some of which he had previously represented , after significant arrests and informed what investigators knew about them .
prosecutor Anne Whyte said : &quot; a criminal justice lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don &apos;t break the law . &quot;
ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender as he has been too involved with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs .
part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of those people .
but that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he acted as much as possible to the police investigation so that they could continue to investigate their criminal activities .
Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute .
he was too close to certain clients , particularly Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .
ditta dismissed any wrongdoing and claimed , &quot; If I were a corrupt lawyer , what I &apos;m not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , then I wouldn &apos;t wait 15 hours , but do that immediately . &quot;
but after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead told police in Lancashire : &quot; Mr Ditta took the step from a criminal defense to a criminal at the moment when he began acquiring drugs from organized criminals . &quot;
his cocaine addiction led to hopeless compounding and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime who instructed him to collect valuable information about police investigations .
lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public .
ditta has survived this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .
Lancashire &apos;s Serious and Organised Crime Unit launched the investigation into Ditta , which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and disability , underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice .
this case should be a warning to criminals and show that none can escape the arm of the law .
we find you and bring you to court .
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to heroin , cocaine and cannabis trafficking .
thirty @-@ five others involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences .
on his website , Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he admitted that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and opportunity inequality was the motivation for his work .
revolutionary work of church music
at the end of the celebrations on the occasion of his 160 @-@ year existence , the Liederkranz Dunningen will outline two services with Franz Schubert &apos;s &quot; Deutsche Messe . &quot;
after the great success of the musicals &quot; Rock my Life , &quot; which inspired viewers in the spring of this year , the Liederkranz will enrich two church services with the performance of Franz Schubert &apos;s Deutsche Messe .
on Saturday , 26 October , this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair in the St. Martinus Church of Dunningen and on Sunday 27 October at 10.15pm at the church of St. John Baptistkirche in Lackendorf .
the so @-@ called Deutsche Messe , with the original title &quot; Sentures for the celebration of the holy victim of the fair , &quot; D 872 , is a spiritual piece of music by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of creation .
the exhibition is performed in the context of the services of God , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .
under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the music association Frohnig Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ .
Haslach : skepticism softens confidence
for example , the 2015 elections to the parish council will change the basic spirit of Haslach ( SE ) .
there is only one common parish council for all six parishes .
in a joint meeting on Saturday , the bodies of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischbach , Steinach and Welschensteinach were preparing for the changes .
there is nothing to change in the basic decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish communities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .
during the day , it became particularly clear : skepticism about the New softer but more tense to confidence .
from the ideas and expectations of the changes in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the full official members of the peace team ranged .
on the basis of a presentation , regional dekan Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for the conservation units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg .
after that , the SE Haslach , as a parish , will form a body of public law that will enter the rights and duties of the six different church communities .
there will only be a common parish council and a council of trustees representing the parish authority .
at least two elected members will be represented from each parish , and the six parish teams will be formed on the ground .
their task will be to promote church life in the place in the future .
when it came to the question of the finances of each parish , there was considerable need for dialogue .
the new rules provide for the allocation of funds in the parish .
the liabilities , on the other hand , go to the entire community .
there have been major concerns , particularly with regard to the large planned investments , the obligation of which will then hit all the parishes .
&quot; in the past , even in the past , only projects managed by the various parishes alone were invested , &quot; relative Haslach &apos;s parish president , Bruno Prinzbach .
practical experience with a common body for five parishes depicted Barbar Ritter , the chairman of the body in the Schutterwald @-@ Neuried peace unit .
they had taken to the task in 2006 of &quot; becoming one , five remaining &quot; and had to find that this is not so easy at all .
the bodies of the Haslacher Peace Unit were then asked to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .
the work will be carried out in further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
in the end , parish commander Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the conservation unit , which was approved by a clear majority .
in Pfullendorf , electricity becomes more expensive
the citizens of Pfullendorfs must adapt to higher electricity costs .
as confirmed by the Managing Director of the Stadtwerke , Jörg @-@ Arne Bias , compared to SÜDKURIER , a four @-@ storey Pfullendorfer family has a cost of 70 to 90 euros per year .
the main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so @-@ called EEG levy from 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilowatt hour .
this levy will be reset each year in October by the four operators of the major power lines .
these quantify the additional costs arising from the energy change that they can charge through a levy on the electricity price .
the towns of Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain .
in its forecasts , the Energy Company &apos;s Supervisory Board even assumed a higher levy , as Jörg @-@ Arne Bias reports .
now the actual figures would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers of the exact price increase next week .
&quot; we &apos;re going from an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; Bias said , with the figure more likely to be near the 2 cents .
traffic light on permanent red : watch waiting time
sometimes a traffic light just doesn &apos;t get green .
contact lines in the street do not respond , or the light sign is defective .
what should you do - go to Red ?
if a person has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains Ralf Becker in the magazine &quot; Motorrad . &quot;
however , the waiting period must be &apos; appropriate &apos; , which could be interpreted differently from one case to another .
Becker advises you to run at least five minutes before starting a function disturbance of the traffic light .
however , anyone who continues to drive despite red light must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it .
anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and points to a decision by the High Court of Hamm .
in the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light offense .
after all , the traffic light was not defective , but jumped on green soon .
he was spared a driving ban because of the particular situation - but the fine did not .
councillors are pleased with sound budget
whenever local council meetings are about the budget , Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .
the commonwealth in Herdwangen @-@ Schönach is well @-@ filled and debt has not known the administration since 2005 .
the 2012 financial year can also be regarded as a full success .
this was evident in the presentation of the 2012 accounts .
as Andrea Rothmund pointed out , the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was over EUR 1 million higher than planned .
the administrative budget surplus is also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach .
the surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the share of the income tax .
the wealth budget was also clearly above the planned values .
instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is essentially due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget , &quot; Mr Rothmund said .
as less investment has been made than planned in the 2012 financial year , the return on deposits has also been higher .
overall , the overall reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million to EUR 4.9 million now .
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work .
&quot; so a work doesn &apos;t just shake out of your sleeve , &quot; Gerster praised with a view of the annual bill .
he and the local councillors visibly enjoyed the good numbers .
it may sound paradoxical , but these very good figures could soon cost citizens expensive .
due to the good financial situation , the community has been able to abandon high levels of leverage in the past .
as a result , aid from the country has already been cut , according to Gerster .
there are prerequisites for these grants from various compensations .
among other things , the cities and municipalities applying for grants have to provide certain lifting rates .
&quot; we need to look at the issue of lifting rates , because in the years to come investment we would like to receive grants , &quot; Gerster announced .
nail : Hugo Wermter for 60 years at the choir
with 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter &apos;s story at the men &apos;s singing club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest , in which he was solemnly honored .
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colors of his men &apos;s singles .
even after 60 years , singing with the chorus , which is now probably more than loving , is still great fun .
Wermter was also active at the club , including 28 years as a member of the committee .
he received several awards for his commitment and association : Jörg Kohr , Pastoral Referent on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg @-@ Stuttgart , as the choir is also a church choir , a certificate of association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst .
his singers handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as a graphic tin plate .
in addition to honoring the 31st Autumn Festival , the MGV betra , the Liederkranz Salzstetten , the singer &apos;s department Baisingen and the local music association , the full maringer had loaded a colourful mix of different choirs and vocal styles that kept around 400 visitors .
the MGV Full Maringen opened with atmospheric songs such as &quot; In the Wine Paradise &quot; and &quot; Lustig , their brothers . &quot;
her honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared a small stand in honour - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart &apos;s &quot; Bundeslied . &quot;
the men &apos;s singing club betra also sang classic choral songs such as &quot; hunters &quot; by Julius Wengert , &quot; Weit , far away &quot; by Hubert Goisern and the folk song &quot; When you walk through the valley . &quot;
the Liederkranz Salzstetten , with its mixed chorus and its women &apos;s group - the &quot; impulschor &quot; - provided the festival &apos;s women &apos;s rate .
the mixed choir performed with the Neapolitan folk &quot; Santa Lucia &quot; and &quot; Eviva Espana &quot; from Antos Gus to foreign countries , while the &quot; impulschor &quot; also resorted to foreign languages : &quot; Liberatio &quot; and &quot; Hey Jude &quot; were part of their program .
the singer &apos;s department of the Baisinger Sports Association came back to home with &quot; What the Schwob ? &quot; by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert &apos;s &quot; beer song &quot; where the full @-@ length music club offered the crowning musical deal .
for the children , there was a small side program - &quot; Oma Hanne &quot; aka Hannelore Stollsteimer introduced a Kasperltheater and read a few stories about how children worked well at noon .

in addition , the winner himself must provide many hard @-@ working builders .
what about the day of action and the helpers ?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb .
it will be delivered to the nursery on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers .
helpers can be parents , grandparents , friends , clubs and , of course , the educators and children themselves .
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
&quot; we are in a frightening situation and one may wonder : what does Parliament think of simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow ? &quot; was read in the newspaper , which considers the draft law not unconstitutional .
&quot; the law is draconian and very criminal and we reject it , &quot; said Cyrus Kamau , managing director of Capital Group , which also includes CapitalFM , one of Kenya &apos;s most respected independent radio stations and news websites .
he said the new media tribunal &quot; will always be biased because it is an extended arm of government , &quot; and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya &apos;s position in the global economy .
&quot; I hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return to Parliament , &quot; he said .
according to The Star newspaper , the government , through the new law , &quot; effectively takes the media into a stranglehold . &quot; by contrast , The Standard , Democracy and Freedom of speech in Kenya had suffered &quot; a serious blow , &quot; and labelled the draft as &quot; draconian . &quot;
the passage of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September .
Kenyan media drew the anger of authorities because they released footage of security cameras on which to see the units sent to the scene allegedly robbed the luxury shopping centre .
police Chief David Kimaiyo responded with the hiring of two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate , even if the pretrial was withdrawn after an outcry by the media .
under the new law , media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shields and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .
the tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid .
according to the Daily Nation , &quot; already a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . &quot;
in addition , the newspaper believes these measures could have a devastating effect on that of its description of &quot; vibrant blogosphere &quot; Kenya .
if they were to silence the media , politicians could do unpunished whatever they want .
&quot; no one will ever know , &quot; wrote Mutuma Mathiu , a journalist at the nation who calls the Kenyan media a crucial control factor in public life .
&quot; leave politicians themselves , lead the country into bankruptcy and return us to the time of hunters and collectors , &quot; he commented .
Kenyan lawmakers have already attracted public anger in the past .
in May , they voted to reverse the cuts imposed by the National Compensation Commission and reinstated their defective salaries of about 532,000 chilling tax @-@ free per month - they are among the highest in the world .
bad @-@ drought home : a dream becomes true for FC
the official inauguration ceremony for the Kunstrasensportplatz was not available despite the cold weather and the rain .
a pleasant celebration last Saturday had probably all wished for , but Petrus did not want to play .
for example , all those who came with no umbrella or could not hold one for any reason .
that went to the musicians who surrounded the festival , just like so many speakers .
nass therefore became the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker , who spoke of fulfilling a dream .
his thanks were mainly due to Mayor Walter Klumpp , who worked hard to implement the project , the local council , the companies involved and members of the association .
here especially Lothar hero , Paul Weizenegger , Heiner Gail and Peter Graf .
the struggling retirees laid out 400 square feet of pavement for the new ways .
this remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by Karl Rombach , a member of the country .
other greeting speakers spoke to the City Sports Committee of Hubert Baier , the district chairman of the Southern Bavarian Football Association , Kuno Kayan , and Friedrich Knorr of the Planning Bureau , who announced a donation to the club &apos;s youth department .
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather @-@ related influences in the spring and autumn gave way to the original lawn place so he could not be beheaded .
as early as 15 years ago , there were the first reflections on solving the problem when the construction of a third place at the football club or at the real school on Lake Saline was envisaged .
both were rejected again .
six years ago , thoughts came up about setting up an art road sports course , which was generally considered the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were launched two years ago , when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Landpacht , pledged a cost of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and approved the country &apos;s funding of EUR 104 000 .
in October 2012 , the local council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356,000 to the total cost of EUR 560 000 , summarized Klumpp .
the construction of the 68 times 108 m artificial turf course took place on 4 June .
during the three @-@ month construction phase , 3000 cubic metres of earth were worn , half of which was used for setting up a Dirt bike track .
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on home affairs and justice .
the relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning .
among other things , it concerns direct democracy , deputies and federal police .
in the morning , the Migration and Integration Working Group also wanted to continue its work .
this should include , among other things , dual citizenship , where both sides have conflicting ideas .
the SPD wants to end the coercion for immigrants born in Germany to opt for one - the Union rejects a double passport .
on the subject of transport , which is not on the agenda this Friday , the SPD endorsed its &apos; no &apos; to a car toll demanded by CSU .
a Vignette is a &quot; flat rate for many driving , and thus environmentally counterproductive , &quot; the SPD negotiator for transport , Florian Pronold , said in a letter to his group .
there have been a threat of evasion on land roads , which are already the main cause of accidents .
the introduction of a toll on all cars would also be a first step from the point of view of Pronolds .
&quot; there is a risk that at a later stage compensation for Germans will be scrapped , &quot; he said .

motorists seriously injured in accident
in an accident on Thursday night , a 37 @-@ year @-@ old passenger from Aachen was seriously injured .
according to police , a 41 @-@ year @-@ old was out of rubbish at 9 : 15 p.m. with her car on the Kempener outside ring towards Grefrath .
as the left wanted to turn on St. Töniser Street , she oversaw the 37 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s opposite car .
the driving spells collided .
the Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment .
Constance : blocking after accident at Schänzlekreisel
the accident occurred , according to police , when a 51 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a Swiss Seat of Ibiza drove on Thursday night , at 8 p.m. , on the left lane of the two @-@ lane Reichenaustraße cityway .
shortly before the roundabout on the Schänzle , he noticed that he was on the left @-@ hand side towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane .
this resulted in the collision with the BMW of a 23 @-@ year @-@ old constable .
also damaged was the behind the BMW passenger VW Passat of a 19 @-@ year @-@ old .
a total of about 15,000 property damage was incurred , police said .
the train had to be closed during the accident , it said .
Vienna airport creates passenger calls
Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .
it will no longer be possible to tell how this will happen at Vienna @-@ Schwechat Airport .
much of the loudspeaker passes away - the noise level should be reduced so much .
creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation .
as Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cessation of passes affecting individuals .
for example , airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai are already abandoning noisy calls .
by dropping these passes - on average , around 200 personal calls by loudspeakers on a day - it is expected to be quiet at the airport in the future .
&quot; it has also become apparent in the experience that these individual passes have been relatively little noticed , but at the same time all other information about changed flight levels or departures here has been underperformed a bit , &quot; Kleemann said in conversation with the radio station .
Highlander Games at Kaltenhof
in addition to the brake truck pulling with tractors , there is a second competition at the autumn farm on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September .
on Saturday , September 7 , the Highlander Games start at 1.30pm .
although they have a Scottish tradition , they are weaker on the Kaltenhof .
teams and individual fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trenches , horseshoe throws and water ice cream .
four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half meters long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t come down to the wicket , &quot; organiser Peter Saile explains .
the tribe has to be cut off in a vertical way , it is supposed to be overshadowed and then just come to the song .
this is rated with most points .
the target accuracy is important when throwing the hose .
from eight feet away is thrown on a Pflock .
skill and strength must be demonstrated by participants in the water ice bear over 50 metres .
time and water levels in a Bottich are measured in the end .
from each &quot; clan &quot; or team , two may participate in the individual competition .
the winners of the team and individual competitions will receive prizes .
you can train as early as 10 a.m.
what is desired is a suitable clothing , for example , the contestants can enter the Schottenrock .
but Swabian costume is also allowed .
for &quot; Outfit , &quot; the jury still awards a few bonus points .
you can register until one hour before the start of the competition .
with the Scottish @-@ Swabian Highlander Games and the tractor @-@ pulling , which begins half an hour earlier , much action has already been said on the festival floor on Saturday .
in the evening , the blowout musicians come at their expense .
at 7 p.m. , the birabnal blowout music from Schömberg creates the great entertainment evening .
the chapel plays the fleet of Polkas and marches .
her repertoire , however , also includes sentimental waltz and a hefty big @-@ band sound .
with this , Heinz Koch , known as the singing host and black roots baron , will be among the hives .
in Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzunft .
on Sunday , the Musikverein Leinstetten maintains early shopping , from 2pm the farm chapel Bopeningen is a guest , and the &quot; Oldies &quot; then leave the festival .
the kick @-@ off is already on Friday with DJ Ralf .
other programme items are on Saturday and Sunday , among other things , the classic @-@ timers meeting , exhibitions of companies on agriculture and forestry .
other attractions on Sunday include the Maislabyrinth , the craft market and sheep &apos;s breeds .
especially for children there is a string zoo , Strohhüpfburg , Traktorfahrt ( under guidance ) and Traktor Surfing .
organisers are the support association multipurpose hall , the ski club and the tractor friends &quot; Zünkäpsele . &quot;
milk and egg alternatives under review
vegan nutrition requires vegetable alternatives to eggs , milk and dairy products .
for example , Pürierte Tofu with plant ahne is a Quarkerrate .
in addition , the Vegetarian and World Heritage Day on November 1 .
the Vegetarierbund Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of the World &apos;s Day on 1 November :
pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter , yogurt let be replaced by soyyoghurt .
instead of milk , soya , port , almond or rice can be used .
incandescent plant metabolism is used for conventional slaughterhouses .
there are also vegetable alternatives to eggs .
half crushed , mature banana , for example , can replace an egg as a binder in a cake .
50 grams of apple acidity or a tablespoon of grinded linen plus three tablespoons of water are also suitable for this .
loosely , ponds instead of egg , for example , with a mixture of a teaspoon baking powder , a tablespoon of saliva strength and three tablespoons of mineral water .
but 50 grams of soyyoghurt or silk ofu can also meet this purpose .
according to Vebu , around 800 000 people are currently feeding vegan in Germany , that is , purely herbal .
sleeper in New York
on the way to their guest families in Weymouth , Massachusetts , the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American big city of New York .
after eight hours of flight , it went straight to Brooklyn Bridge , via which the heart of the city , Manhattan , was reached on foot .
a fascinating view of the world @-@ famous skyline has already been offered here .
by the time the students were on the legs nearly 24 hours , but true to the motto &quot; The City does not sleep &quot; was decided the day at Times Square .
despite shutdown , on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached with a ferry and put on foot .
it then passed through the financial centre around Wall Street to commemorate Sept . 11 .
on the third day , students from the 373 @-@ metre high viewing platform of the Empire State Buildings were able to gain an overview of the intriguing big city while enjoying the view .
after that , it went through the hectic running of New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to Central Park , which provided an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun .
after a brief flight from New York to Boston , students have since arrived in their host families and experience school day at Weymouth High School .
a Hubertusmesse will also be celebrated this year on the name of the Holy Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße .
St. Hubertus was the saga after a fairly ruthless hunter swept through a vision and was later appointed bishop of Lüttich .
the hunting hornblower group of the Jagdreiter Westphalia , led by Brigitte Kluth , is performing at Parforcehörner ( Nature listeners in the mood Es ) after old , originally French melodies .
the leaves carry riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders , horses and dogs on tow hunting .
the ceremony will take place on Sunday 3 November at 11.30 a.m.
the newly designed opt @-@ out shines with a new cafe .
one that invites you to rest and come back .
one that wants to make the name of the programme .
according to Lexikon , a psychological phenomenon is called Déjà Vu , which is reflected in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation .
in the event of a visit to the famous café at the Opuss in the district town of Kleve in sight of the Rhine @-@ Waal university , it does not have to stay with the pure déjà Vu feeling .
after all , the café , with the beautiful name , has exactly the aim : to make an actual stay not only thoughtful but handsomely recurring .
because it &apos;s just fun and just nice .
a glimpse of the inner life on the Opbot 8 gives the viewer a good feeling .
the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good .
the team will spoil you with the greens Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with various types of coffee or cocktail .
there &apos;s delicious cakes or individually beamed fresh baguettes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the sleek café on offer as restaurants : in Kranenburg they conducted the Art Lounge .
from the move to Kleve to the opener , the sympathetic café lovers are hoping for more audiences .
not least through college .
&quot; with no specific target group , &quot; notes Daniel Büttner .
rather , the two here want to address young students just like seniors and all ages in between .
speaking of cafe lovers .
the likeable owner is behind the coffee pleasure .
enjoy the fragrant hot blower in various variations .
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more of the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker .
&quot; to this a baguette - that &apos;s my thing , &quot; she told the NRZ .
two events were already in the bright café .
better said one .
after all , the harbour festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit .
but there was also the ring nature evening .
&quot; nice , successful and funny , &quot; the two 33 @-@ year @-@ olds found .
but just not Jedermann &apos;s thing .
perhaps Daniel Büttner is not an outstanding fan of event evenings either : &quot; you can &apos;t do it all right now . &quot;
and with an event I always speak only those who are also interested in the special event .
this is why events will be the exception of us .
&quot; we want to disrupt the very normal operation as little as possible . &quot;
let &apos;s say : Déjà Vu also stands for reliability .
with regard to the quality of the products offered here , as well as to the team and the beautiful surroundings of the Opelt in Kleve .
the road , which is becoming more and more a restaurant .
to the delight of many Klever , the guests from close and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and hence the Café Déjà Vu .

a Day of Thanks at the MGV in Dinker
it was the 160th foundation festival to which the MGV &quot; Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker &quot; invited this year and 52 guests , active singers and their wives , were happy to come .
in the &quot; Witteborg &quot; restaurant , in Dinker , everyone enjoyed the harmonious coexistence of music .
traditionally , the foundation is always the right festival to hold honours .
this time , writer Rolf Wagener was freed about the special award &quot; singer of the Year . &quot;
&quot; you have not only written a lot for us , but have also shot some round for us , our heartfelt thanks for that , &quot; said the chairman of the Choir Erich Schlotmann .
the awards for participation in the appearances and choral rehearsals by means of activity stories went to the choir manager Dieter Schulze with 44 participations this year , followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier @-@ Ribbert , the chairman himself , and last year &apos;s &quot; singer of the Year &quot; Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each .
place five lectured central aide Artur Brückner .
a special thank you was sent to the team of club manager Ange Pier @-@ Ribbert , who once again had a menu of the extra @-@ class and to Gerda Pier @-@ Ribbert for the table decoration .
the MGV &quot; Friedrich @-@ Wilhelm &quot; meets every Tuesday at 7.45 p.m. at the club &apos;s local .
&quot; new soothing voices are welcome to us at any time , &quot; says Schlotmann .
UN announces new targets for poverty reduction
from now on , the United Nations is starting to draw up a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty .
in the run @-@ up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting &quot; sustainable development goals &quot; to replace the Millennium Goals , which expires in 2015 .
they were included in the final draft of the document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including Ms Gillard , at the summit .
UN Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to &quot; think about national interests . &quot;
&quot; I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch a process to agree on universal , sustainable development goals , &quot; he said .
&quot; these objectives will build on our progress in the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post @-@ 2015 Development Framework .
I will not shy away from implementing this mandate given to me by the Member States to realise our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Goals . &quot;
even though SG Achim / Baden has been without a win for four days , the handball league is still good .
coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that .
everyone remains fully motivated on the matter .
nevertheless , I hope that we will finally win again .
&quot; because I don &apos;t know at all how such a win tastes , &quot; Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .
even though the third @-@ round reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet demolished trees , Malmon warns the pointer .
I have trained many players myself in A @-@ Youth .
therefore , they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex @-@ coach .
&quot; in addition , it is important to wait to see if there is any reinforcement from the first , &quot; explains SG @-@ Coach .
to finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must certainly increase compared to previous appearances .
most importantly , in the capping work and in the reshuffle game , it last seemed huge .
equal opportunities must also definitely be better .
so I hope my players finally got their heads free during the short break .
security concerns in Mozambique grow amid clashes between influential figures
thousands of people gathered in central Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the state founder and first president of Mozambique , to agree to peace calls at a rare public demonstration .
&quot; we want peace again , we want stability , &quot; said Vanessa de Sousa , managing director of an investment firm .
fearing for the future of the country , she swapped her business clothes against a T @-@ shirt with the inscription &quot; We demand security &quot; in Portuguese and joined the crowd at the capital &apos;s Independence Square on Thursday .
for two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and RENAMO , which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .
RENAMO was once a notorious rebel movement , initially backed by the White @-@ ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country &apos;s independent government .
after the 1992 peace treaty , she became an opposition party .
analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a widening conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .
much is at stake for the fast @-@ growing economy , because the discovery of vast gas reserves off the coast and coal miners in the northwest could bring investment of more than $ 50 billion from companies like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US over the next few years .
the ruling Frelimo party , the dominant force since 1975 , and RENAMO blame each other for the tensions .
RENAMO claims the government has provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional stronghold of Renamos , on October 17 .
the assaults on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked RENAMO bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the group &apos;s leader , Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times .
the government blames RENAMO for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .
President Armando Guebuza has sought to downplay concerns about instability .
speaking to AFP , the French news agency , he said Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself a &quot; loser &quot; who &quot; wants to use all his remaining forces to prove he can impose his decisions on the government . &quot;
both Frelimo and RENAMO stress that they want to avoid war .
but concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying RENAMO issued the 1992 peace agreement .
he explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo would no longer respect the agreement .
&quot; our vision is to resume negotiations and be serious , &quot; Mazanga said .
previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year .
&quot; we have here two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who come together the heads , &quot; says Joseph Hanlon , a lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert .
none of them is good at negotiating and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
RENAMO , which is pushing for election reforms , has already said it will boycott the local elections in November .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .
Renamos electoral success has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party founded by a former RENAMO member will probably improve in the elections .
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country &apos;s democracy .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t want multi @-@ party democracy , he doesn &apos;t want transparent elections , he doesn &apos;t want peace because he doesn &apos;t want to give up the presidential office , &quot; Mazanga said .
it is unclear what capacity RENAMO has , but it has taken unrest inciting attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major North @-@ South link .
most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala , which lies a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but where Beira is located , the port , the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .
in June , Rio broke a month to use the railroad after RENAMO announced an attack on the track .
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether RENAMO will repeat that threat .
RENAMO wanted to &quot; warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , &quot; Mazanga said .
instability has boosted frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already been caused by corruption , sluggish progress in development and a recent abduction wave .
&quot; people think the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , &quot; he explains .
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said people just wanted stability .
&quot; no one interested RENAMO and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads again , &quot; he explained .
children should be taught myths and legends as &quot; models for life , &quot; according to an author .
Thor &apos;s stories showed that &quot; brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , &quot; and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .
many of the myths , however , are &quot; far too wild , too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools , &quot; which is why Crossley @-@ Holland argued for a &quot; careful selection &quot; of age @-@ appropriate works .
&quot; I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education , &quot; he said .
I have proposed this for twenty years as a plan .
he added that in authors and teachers who are &quot; overly didactic , &quot; children would be &quot; completely shut off &quot; because in entertaining stories , the messages would be &quot; subdued . &quot;
Crossley @-@ Holland , who has translated Beowulf from the Angels and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales , explained : &quot; you can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background as possible . &quot;
perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults , and an author who writes for children , lies in the need to convey hope .
not everything needs to be simplified or led to the Happy End , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .
this must be understated , revealed by history and not explained .
this is the old story of the moment rather than narrative .
Hansjakob resumes in FREIHOF
100 years ago , Heinrich Hansjakob raised his retirement seat in Haslach , on Sunday his last years became alive in the &quot; FREIHOF . &quot;
the many spectators were thrilled by the extremely short scene game .
from the arrival of the award of honorary citizenship to his death , screenwriter and Hansjakov actor Alois Kraftzcyk designed an entertaining piece that received much applause under the direction of Cornelia &apos;s people .
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a spokesman with the 10 different scenes , declaring connections and bridging periods from youth to approaching retirement .
on October 22 , 1913 Hansjakob home in his children &apos;s sky , in his FREIHOF .
and then the scene game , in which Alois Krafczyk once again shines in his parsley as a great son of the city .
he was born in Mühlenbach .
he was not only received by the audience with much applause , but his sister Philippine also welcomed him .
Billy Sum @-@ Hermann understood it incredibly good to get into the role of the sister and succumb to her in facial and vocal life .
between the various game scenes , the Mühlenbacher farmhouse chapel played appropriately selected pieces of music , thus complementing the performance .
in order to award the honorary citizen , Haslach Mayor Heinz Winkler then gave himself the honor , which in representing the then incumbent Hättich , along with part of the council , made his warning .
her reprieve then made the three @-@ royal singer , who led Hansjakob to the exclamation : &quot; ah how beautiful , there will again be youth visits to my own three @-@ royal time alive . &quot;
with her song &quot; O Jesulein , &quot; they greeted the audience in the FREIHOF as well as the storyteller with her loud &quot; Heraus , Heraus . &quot;
his criticism of the county church had raised Hansjakob at the time as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war .
in the homeland , behind his grave chapel on the fire at Hofstetten , he found his resting place .
&quot; an uneasy spirit had finally found his calm and had gone home forever , &quot; it said at the end of the scene .
much applause and many loving words were given by the audience for the performance .
basketball : the hope of Neckar giants grows
the chances of the league remaining the sporadically increased Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketballer have increased .
because should there be a wild @-@ card procedure , there is now a competitor less for the Neckar giants .
the basketball project Hamburg Towers refrains from applying for a possible backgrounds .
&quot; we will not participate in the wild @-@ card trial , &quot; said ex @-@ national player Pascal Roller , who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in Hanseatic City since 2012 .
a first breath was not heard from Ludwigsburg .
&quot; we did not deal with the wild @-@ card procedure so long as it is not established that Düsseldorf does not receive a licence , &quot; Neckar giant boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper .
up to May 23 , upstart Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Court of Arbitration and prove its economic status .
until now , however , the Rhineland has been denied the licence twice .
the Court of Arbitration is the last instance .
Haigerloch : supper skirt moves into focus
as a contribution by the city to the 150 @-@ year anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch , the city &apos;s cultural and tourism office is dedicated to the last of its public themed tours on Sunday 27 October , the supper church .
after the visit of the Atomic Cell Museum , the Haigerlocher is expected to be considered time after 1850 when Haigerloch came under presidential rule .
the crowning final point is a visit to the supper church .
there , leaders get the story of building the church and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in one by and through Catholic territory .
last but not least , in the church there is a view of the evening maids created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halfritter .
it is an orginal reproduction of the famous Milan lecture by Leonardo da Vinci .
meeting point for the other half @-@ hour guided tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomkeller Museum .
tickets are available at the box office of the Atomic Museum .
for questions and information , the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available .
Snowden could also testify in Russia
former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. spade in his Russian asylum .
representatives of the federal prosecutor &apos;s office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30 @-@ year @-@ old personally in Russia .
that notified the Interfax agency , citing unspecified circles familiar with the situation .
such an issue could be resolved intergovernmental , it said .
a departure from Russia is virtually excluded .
&quot; in this case , he loses his refugee status , &quot; the agency quoted her source as saying .
because Germany is a US ally , Snowden drops extradition there , it said
long breath pays off
six men &apos;s teams fought for the winning title in the tennis tournament of clubs .
in the end , the endurance of Team Maier / Bronner decided the last match .
a dream weather had been given to the tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf to the tournament of local clubs and friends .
the fun of tennis was at the forefront of the tournament .
there were five games per team on the plan , with everyone playing against everyone .
played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes .
Anja Schlichter heads the tournament
the tournament guide was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter , supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer .
after the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta , the tournament went into the crucial stage .
the favourites Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner were on par with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic ( both teams of SG Rohrweiler ) , so the last two matches had to make the decision .
at the winning ceremony , Carmen Müller finally handed the hiking pot to Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner , who had the longest breath on the finish line .
second place was the double Michael Klippel / Sadmin Osmicic .
the bronze recap reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team Asphaltriecher .
for late afternoon sun and coffee and cakes , the tournament &apos;s success took place .
at the end of August , the Black Forest Open Light Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in children &apos;s hands .
traditionally , the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday , August 24 and 25 , as part of the summer holiday programme , to a colourful children &apos;s and family festival with numerous co @-@ operations and events .
&quot; big and small people can learn different old craft on both days , &quot; the press release said .

the children have regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
the museum workshop is also a workshop .
during the construction of cuckoo coatings , water wheels or carpets , young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship .
a lot of fun also promise the many old games , such as Schubkarren races or stunt runs .
speed and coordination are required here .
for all the small detectives , the open @-@ air museum offers a gym tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday , at 12 and 14 p.m. each .
on a change of direction , children have to guess which stories correspond to or are relaxed .
in addition , visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open @-@ air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes .
not only horses but also many other animals such as sheep , goats , cows and chickens are to be found on the site and to be amazed .
in addition , all children on Sunday are welcome to the Clown Otsch , which drives its Schabernack with museum guests from 11 a.m.

in a New Zealand small town , Burt Muro is regarded as a lovable bail because he decided to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle , construction year 1920 .
Burt is not deterred from his dream despite a heart failure .
with his savings , a few donations and a mortgage on his old factory tiles , he is putting over by ship to Los Angeles .
after the film there is coffee , tea and cake .
shrill Piepsen disrupts residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land .
they distribute coal coming from the ships to the hold .
the company has several iron in the fire at the site .
in addition to Kohleimport , Rhenus Midgard relies , among other things , on wind turbine logistics .
black shields the coal on the warehouse in front of the levee .
distribute or load the coal here as needed .
at each movement of the transmitters , a screaming warning device tweets over the site .
&quot; the signals serve security and are required by law , &quot; says Matthias Schrell , managing director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven .
in case of unfavourable winds , this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city centre .
he takes the lawsuits very seriously and therefore contacted those affected , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old says .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quiet with technical measures .
it will continue to rely on open dialogue with its neighbours .
after all , Matthias Schrell still has a lot in front of the site .
with the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge , Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector .
thanks to the 18 @-@ 5 @-@ metre rectangle in front of the terminal , Capesize @-@ Bulkcarrier can be made here .
&quot; this year we want to crack the 3 @-@ million @-@ tonne mark at the envelope , &quot; shrines .
in addition to the Eon power plant on the ground , imported coal goes to power plants in the inland .
if the GDF @-@ Suez power station goes to the net , well 5 million tons of coal port per year are realistic .
the three shipping trucks on the bridge as well as the second transport band could create up to 10 million .
Bayerns basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish huge optimism among the basketball players at FC Bayern Munich .
&quot; no one can forbid us to believe even against the best team in Europe over the past two years , &quot; noted Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) on Thursday night at defending champion Olympiakos Piräus .
we sent the message : even in Munich there is basketball !
in her only third appearance in the European premier class , Munich sold very well for a long time , but was simply not clear enough in the decisive stages .
the guests first managed the feat of converting a 15 @-@ point backhand 13 minutes before finishing to a lead before Piräus gave the game another turn .
&quot; we fought incredibly back against the two @-@ time Euroleague champion , but then made reckless mistakes again , &quot; Bayern pro Yassin Idbihi said .
we &apos;re proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful scorers in Munich , who had celebrated clear victories in the first two matches against Italian serial master Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title carrier Zielona Góra .
Ben Greenman : ten Years New York Comedy Festival : the New Yorker
one could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand @-@ up comedy in America : just a hundred years ago , the varietologist Frank Fay , who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway , began telling the crowd straight jokes in the form of a conversation .
over the years , Fays innovation has been expanded , just as last at the New York Comedy Festival .
launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch , the founder of stand @-@ up institution Carolines , this year &apos;s festival celebrates its 10th anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and major theaters .
&quot; most of these headliners began at Carolines and then became increasingly successful until they were at some point known to compete in a club , &quot; Hirsch said .
we designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them .
this year &apos;s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes , Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher , as well as &quot; Stand Up for Heroes , &quot; an annual music and comedy charity event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden , where Bruce Springsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill perform .
with the festival , the world of comedy has grown as well .
a number of comedians attending this year &apos;s festival have become aware of more unconventional ways , such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central , FX and Spike .
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television ( the ironic @-@ sounding fantasy football series &quot; The League &quot; on FXX ) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central .
Jenny Slate was part of the cast at &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; as well as &quot; Parks and Recreation , &quot; although she is best known for her viral video series &quot; Marcel the Shell with Shoes On . &quot;
both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik , the ironic , focused on racial issues W. Kaumau Bell ) are products of the decentralised world of American comedy .
one of the festival &apos;s biggest visitor magnets is an interview : David Steinberg speaks with Larry David .
Steinberg began as a stand @-@ up comedian but has become a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian .
from 2005 to 2007 he moderated a television programme entitled &quot; Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg &quot; at TV Land .
the meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan .
&quot; the city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry &apos;s entire work , &quot; Steinberg said .
he told me if he is here , he sometimes goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks : hey , if I lose all my money , then maybe I live here .
Iran satisfied with nuclear negotiations process
Iran is showing a week ahead of the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto courts and Germany satisfied with the negotiation process .
&quot; after years , you now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to remove the differences of recent years , &quot; Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawd Sarif wrote on his Facebook page .
it would be a long way to go , but the nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will eventually find a solution .
drama in Uruguay : young kill game mates with machete
two children admitted the murder of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old in Uruguay .
the two 14 and 12 year old boys had invited their victim to go with them on bird hunting .
with machetes and knives armed , they stole the 11 @-@ year @-@ old on Tuesday and threw the corpse into a well , the newspaper El País reported Thursday .
they would then have played football in front of their apartments in a working @-@ class neighborhood .
the Leichnam was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado , 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach resort Punta del Este .
as Alibi , a five @-@ year @-@ old half @-@ sister of the teen they had taken part in testifying she had been sexually assaulted by the boy .
but when the girl before police described the diarrhea without mentioning an attack against her , the two boys admitted the 11 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s intentional killing .
among other things , the elder called a rivalry in the football game .
he was provisionally transferred to a psychiatric youth institution .
pimp must go to prison
for exploitative trafficking , pimps , threat , insult and dangerous bodily injury , the county court has sentenced Konstanz to three and a half years in prison for a 33 @-@ year @-@ old man from St. Georgen .
the former Bundeswehr soldier , who worked as a doorman after two operations in Afghanistan , set off a confession in the course of a trial .
thus , in five cases , he met women via Internet or telephone contacts , which he sent to the counter after a few weeks against their will .
he used resistance to break with violence and threats .
he retained the income of the women , some of whom he managed for years .
by confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards , he kept women &apos;s contacts with the outside world .
along with a colleague who conveyed the women , he brought them to various brothels in the southwest .
there , he left them partly to monitor their revenue .
in court , the defendant initially claimed he was suffering from a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died next to him in an explosion .
after a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about mental restraint and thus about reduced guilt , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old laid out a comprehensive confession .
the court did not have to hear any of the injured women .
as a Kripo official reported , at least four other cases of exploitative trafficking were identified after an initial ad by telephone surveillance .
the absentee talks were marked by high aggression .
in later interrogations , the injured parties would have confirmed their martyrdom .
another witness , during which one of the women on the whole body had discovered blue spots , has made no statement until today .
it was &quot; a completely broken personality , &quot; which considered violence and exploitation in this tier to be normal .
the defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday .
&quot; he settled out of these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after detention , &quot; he said .
oil prices continue to rise to $ 96 a barrel
the price of oil has also fallen further Friday after concerns about a high offer overshadowed a report that China &apos;s energy @-@ efficient manufacturing sector is growing .
the reference fee for deliveries in December was down 14 cents to $ 96.24 a barrel late in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
the contract fell 39 cents on Thursday , which represented a 5.8 percent fall in October .
the large crude oil supply has impacted prices in recent weeks .
the U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that the U.S. offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .
over the course of five weeks , the offer had risen by 25 million barrels .
but on Friday there was evidence of increased demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing .
this suggests a continued recovery in China &apos;s economy , whose growth had risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it reached its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter .
crude oil from the Sorte Brent , a reference value for international crude oil also used by U.S. refineries , fell 26 cents to $ 108.58 a barrel on the ICE Exchange in London .
Court blocks decision on NYPD &apos;s Stop @-@ and @-@ Frisk Directive
a federal appeals court in the U.S. blocked the order of a judge on Thursday calling for changes to the stop @-@ and @-@ risk program ( &quot; stop and search &quot; ) of the New York Police Department , and stripped the judge of the case .
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin &apos;s decisions would be suspended until a city &apos;s appeal was decided .
the judge ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way the program is implemented for the holding and questioning of people .
the city appealed against its assessment and the remedies requested , including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and training programmes .
the Court of Appeals heard the arguments on the required suspension on Tuesday .
the Appeal Report stated that the judge must be stripped of the case as it violated the code of conduct for U.S. judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partisanship ; this was partly based on a series of media interviews and public statements in which it had publicly responded to the court &apos;s criticism .
the judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the stop @-@ and @-@ risk program .
it appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms to guidelines , training and service supervision , and ordered a pilot program with cameras trapped on the body in neighborhoods where most controls were carried out .
in August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after a check by police .
an oral trial to appeal the city is scheduled after March 14 , 2014 .
the stop @-@ and @-@ risk tactic has been criticised by a number of civil rights advocates .
controls of this kind have been in different forms for decades , but the number of checks recorded during the term of nonpartisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all @-@ time high of 684,330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .
in 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities filed a lawsuit that turned into a collection box .
supporters of changes to the NYPD &apos;s stop @-@ and @-@ risk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force , as well as influence the way other police chiefs use the scheme .
opponents believe the changes would dampen the morale of the police , but not crime ; nor would money be wasted and the broader problem of a police force under pressure after the removal of thousands of bodies in the last decade .
the judge pointed out that they do not end the stop @-@ and @-@ risk practice , which is constitutional , but only the way the checks are implemented by the NYPD reformed .
of the happiness of the dreaming camels
happiness is an oasis to reach only dreaming camels succeed
with this sense of smell , the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association &quot; helping hands . &quot;
on Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated , which can already have considerable success .
first chairman Henne reported extensively on the association &apos;s work .
he himself was the first time in Mauritania at Cheijk @-@ Zajed hospital in Nouakchott in 2004 .
as a result , further cooperation developed , and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on the ground on several trips .
during the speeches , pictures of the entries on a large screen were shown so that guests of the anniversary event could see the actions mentioned .
the association &apos;s desert vehicle was also shown .
it is a former federal border guard vehicle .
Rainer Prewo , the former OB of Nagold , had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning , according to Henne , to work at the association in advisory capacity .
in 2008 , Zimmerei Schleeh , from Baiersbronn in the record time of just over a week , created the hospital in Socogim , an elder district on the outskirts of the capital - volunteer .
Henne also mentioned a new mother @-@ child hospital in Nouakchott
especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be wegrated in Nagold .
you learn a lot in Africa as a physician , according to Henne , for example , deprivation against burn @-@ out .
because of the political unrest in the country , you could not make as many trips as planned , but many physicians came to Germany to host here in various areas .
in addition , containers with material are regularly sent to Africa , so in March this year medical devices , drugs , bandages , hospital beds and eyeglasses .
co @-@ initiator Hans @-@ Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered plenty of local colorit by counting from Mauritania from Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile brick and showing the experiences of the regular musicians , who traditionally support the club , during their trip to Mauritania .
as his personal motivations , he called his work on auditing as a young Member .
when he became clear how much money was lost , he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people .
in addition , Fuchtel stressed that the global economy also perpetuates global human love .
nor should we forget that Africa is closer than some think .
from Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa .
Coulson set up phone hacking for checking a tip
former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly suspended &quot; phone hacking , surveillance and confrontation &quot; in trying to confirm a false tip about an affair of then @-@ Home Secretary Charles Clarke .
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in the Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his &quot; attractive special adviser &quot; Hannah Pawlby .
the newspaper instructed private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlong &apos;s voicemails , and pursued them , but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court drove .
&quot; according to the prosecutor &apos;s office , Coulson , who is now the editor of the NotW , is no one who stands in front of the home of people and hopes to trap them on fresh fact , but one who likes to face a story to see their reaction , &quot; Edis explained .
he said NotW used three procedures to investigate stories investigative : phone hacking , surveillance and confrontation .
the editor is personally involved in the third method .
obviously he knows of the second , the surveillance , otherwise it cannot be .
what about the first one ?
does he know about the phone hacking ?
he disputes that , but we say , &quot; and whether he knew about it . &quot;
rumours of an affair Clarkes was first picked up by NotW &apos;s feature editor when a source sexually interested in Pawlby said : &quot; don &apos;t waste your time , she &apos;s with Charles . &quot;
a band of voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire &apos;s apartment in August 2006 .
investigators also found entries on the detective &apos;s computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as &quot; projects . &quot;
at the time the search was under way , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them , Edis explained .
meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Pawlby &apos;s movements .
on June 18 , 2005 , Coulson left her with a voicemail with the following content : &quot; I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow , about which I would like to talk to Charles . &quot;
EDIS explained that Coulson &apos;s activities on this story followed the same pattern as other key figures , such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett .
the jury heard Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced a married woman because of an affair when he himself was littered with the co @-@ accused Rebekah Brooks , who had been married at the time .
Coulson and Brooks contend to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3 , 2000 and August 9 , 2006 .
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking .
in protest against the planned wealth tax , French football will actually pass through the first strike since 1972 .
a light meeting is concluded without results .
in the conflict over wealth taxes , the government and professional football in France have managed to get into a stalemate after a failed arbitration meeting .
President François Hollande received association and association representatives on Thursday at the Paris Élysée Palace and heard their complaints .
but he refused to spare football from the planned 75 @-@ percent levy on income of more than a million euros a year , which all the country &apos;s firms are expected to pay for two years from 2014 .
the opposite side remained tough , too .
the strike , announced for the end of November , will now be swept through , the head of the Proficlubs Association ( UCPF ) , Jean @-@ Pierre Louvel , said .
the days of play in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 started between 29 November and 2 December .
fighting : no absolute protection possible
&quot; we want to involve residents early in planning , &quot; Mayor Jens Houter opened the Citizens &apos; Information Conference on the flood protection concept in Gechingen .
about 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the measures planned , ask questions , raise concerns and bring ideas .
Houter made it clear : &quot; the eventual decisions take the members of the council . &quot;
the flooding , which hit Gechingen on May 15 , 2009 , unprepared , was a cutting @-@ edge event that raised questions about protections for the future , according to Houter .
a river basin investigation had been commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .
&quot; the protection of as many plots as possible is the goal , &quot; says Houter .
the planning of protection against flooding , according to the German weather service , is based on statistics every 100 years .
climate change is taken into account by a 15 % surcharge .
this is called &quot; HQ 100aClimate . &quot;
the water masses , which had caused significant damage in 2009 , matched a 1,000 @-@ year flooding .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement we can achieve , &quot; Houter added .
in order to secure the protection of HQ 100aclimate , around four million euros will have to be invested in fighting , with the community expected to face national subsidies of around 70 per cent .
Houter pointed out , however , that there is support only if an overall approach is implemented .
to this end , the community needs the participation of its citizens .
a complex planning and authorisation procedure must be completed .
it is best to start implementation in 2016 .
among other things , the concept of protection , which was presented in the local council last week ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the flow of the river Irm from the National Valley .
following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns .
among other things , it questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place .
Gregor Kühn , specialist planner of the commissioned engineering firm Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum .
in addition , you can find the most economical solution , according to Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe .
resentment prevailed among residents of the old town who , even with normal thunderstorms , have repeatedly suffered from overload of the canal network .
the problem is well @-@ known with administration and initial measures have already been taken .
however , Houter pointed out that the guidelines for canal systems are different than for flood protection and should not be mixed .
the community is required to interpret the canal network in such a way that two @-@ to @-@ three @-@ year regenerals could be entangled .
making sewage channels larger would spare millions .
seriously injured after collision
in early Friday afternoon , two motorists were seriously injured in a frontal collision on the National Road 44 near Revensdorf .
police closed the road immediately , but could say little about the accident at first .
however , there are various testimonies that should only be evaluated .
it is clear that the 19 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a VW Golf was heading towards Revensdorf and the 38 @-@ year @-@ old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai .
both vehicles collided , with the woman so badly trapped that the fire department needed nearly half an hour to free her from the vehicle wrap .
the real cause of the accident was initially unexplained .
both of the casualties came in nearby hospitals .
the track remained fully closed for about two hours .
it could be called the US Dostojewski .
Philip K. Dick was a Gottsucher , a metaphysicist , his novels and narratives also have something serious .
startling the kinship in the exterior : the steaming eyes , the beard , the high forehead .
and so , as Fjodor M. Dostojewski can be understood with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apology of the Russian soul , one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet , which is quite true in his own country .
some titles have been published in Heyne Verlag , the Haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives distributes two thousand @-@ second .
Dick explains America - the realm of stunning technical progress , coupled with paranoia , security wound and faith to be chosen .
Dick had worship experiences , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , had drugs added to his brain .
he broke , early on , that the machines are divinities .
he wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine , the creator from his creature .
this is the Blade Runner problem .
the killing .
a Master of Science Fiction .
a fantastic writer .
his Storys have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott , Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg .
this story is particularly significant now .
the &quot; minority report &quot; dates back to 1956 , it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals .
it develops the principle of &quot; Prä @-@ Crime , &quot; that is , what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House .
in Dicks world that resembles our terrifying , mutants look to the future - and the police are attacking .
&quot; we capture individuals who have not violated any law , &quot; says the head of the authority .
&quot; we grab them before they can commit a violent crime . &quot;
and , &quot; There are no serious criminals in our society , we have a strawberry full of Pesudobrecher , &quot; you read time streams .
they assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal thought from being put into effect .
Dick &apos;s narrative acts as the blueprint for the anti @-@ terror laws and the interception of the NSA .
anticipation of the attack : so does Obama &apos;s drone philosophy and practice .
but Dick &apos;s story is not over yet .
the police chief complains that there is no more separation of powers , the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state .
then the monitor itself is monitored and transferred to a future crime .
the system turns through .
it &apos;s perfect , but it &apos;s lying .
it invests its own conditions .
takes mistakes and sacrifices not only in purchase , but builds on them .
the system creates the danger of fighting it .
Philip K. Dick read , repeatedly , to come closer to the truth .
spying on Merkel in Russia
former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. spying on German Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum .
representatives of the German federal prosecutor could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30 @-@ year @-@ old personally in Russia , the Interfax agency reported .
prior to that , the Greens leader Hans @-@ Christian Flubele met yesterday as the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair .
NSA revelations reinforce company paranoia because of government surveillance
on a mild day at the end of August , a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main , Germany &apos;s financial capital .
on the orders of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism ( BVT ) , the German Home Intelligence Service , he should photograph the roof of the US Foreign Post , which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .
according to German media , the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of language between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin .
James clapper , U.S. Director of National Intelligence , again insisted in September that the U.S. did not use foreign espionage options &quot; to steal the operating secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit . &quot;
but since Edward Snowden , the former employee who became a whistleblower , began publishing his filling horns to U.S. surveillance secrets , European governments and business chiefs are no longer sure if they can take the director at the word .
reports that the American National Security Agency is spiking Brazilian oil company Petrobas and collecting data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company paranoia to a new peak because of government surveillance .
the barrel to overrun brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s phone had vanished , possibly for 10 years .
if the most powerful person in Europe can target , then corporate governance is certainly potential targets .
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence and business transparent .
I think it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit .
&quot; Germany must wake up , &quot; explains Oliver Green , president of BITMi , which represents small and medium @-@ sized IT companies in Germany .
German companies believe the US now poses an almost as high risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY .
however , in the documents leaked by Snowden , there has so far been no evidence that the US has passed on the operating secrets of foreign companies to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US .
companies are sceptical about this .
in the Bundestag it was suggested that we should build a German Google .
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them ...
&quot; that &apos;s not working , &quot; says Hasso Plattner , chairman of German software maker SAP .
if we had wanted a strong European IT industry , we should not have let it die 20 years ago .
everything in Germany is subsidised , from coal to cars to agriculture .
everything , except the IT industry .
still , reach and technical sophistication of US spy agencies uncovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked firms that had previously seen the largest spy risk in China .
there is a major change in cloud computing , because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the United States is subject to jurisdiction and are therefore potentially at risk .
according to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance , a trade institution , after revelations about U.S. data mining activities with Prism shed about 10 percent of non @-@ U.S. members &apos; plans to use an American provider .
Jim Snabe , deputy managing director of SAP , says : &quot; we see a new question from customers that didn &apos;t exist a year ago - it is : where are my data stored and can you guarantee that these will remain physically in this legal area ? &quot;
many German business leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew , namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that they must therefore be guarded at all costs .
it is no surprise that economic espionage is taking place .
that has always been the case .
&quot; it has been an issue for many years and has not fundamentally changed by the current discussion , &quot; says Kurt Bock , chairman of chemical company BASF .
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial level , just as we do , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
the management does not normally discuss the counter @-@ measures taken , because this gives an advantage to attackers .
in large companies , employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick at a fair or keeping a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable , to say the least .
Ulrich Hackenberk , chief executive at automaker Audi , says it has been part of standard practice for years before a board meeting to collect the phones so that they cannot be used as interception devices .
the German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when they go on overseas trips because smartphones may be compromised .
prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards .
there is concern , however , that small and medium @-@ sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance .
in Germany , many of these companies are world leaders in their respective niches .
&quot; small and medium @-@ sized businesses often lack the experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect operating secrets against unauthorized access , &quot; the BVT warns in a report .
the US warns its own firms against economic espionage by other countries .
according to Washington Post , the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate in February ordered France , Russia and Israel behind China to rank two of the countries that used to obtain economic data from the hacking .
a board member of a German blue @-@ chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage , then &quot; the French are the worst . &quot;
Bernard Squarcini , former head of French Interior Secretary DCRL , was quoted this month in an interview with the following words : &quot; the intelligence services know very well that even if they work together in the fight against terror , all countries spy on their allies . &quot;
Hechingen : fair gives answer to wedding questions
&quot; marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that humans can do , &quot; said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard .
tips on how at least the wedding party succeeds have now been given a special fair in the domain in Hechingen .
important suppliers were represented around a wedding .
one trend : the retro @-@ look has rebounded .
that starts about the wedding clothes .
white is must , best covered or in cream .
in the front , the dresses , often marked with embroidery , are closed , often with a veil , but at the back they go down and often end up in a tow .
however , the ghosts , as Stefanie Koch of the fashion house , are divorced .
in gentlemen , the suit dominates with Weste and Plastron , but it can also be chosen creamy or brown combinations .
it is important to select the location , it has been explained .
the room was very clean and comfortable .
here the domain drew attention to their own offer in the remake .
if you want to go ahead with the carriage , Uwe Link has an offer .
&quot; Kutsche , however , is also popular for young women &apos;s singles , &quot; he thinks .
romance is also required for invitations , flower arrangements and wedding pictures .
more and more in fashion comes the &quot; after @-@ Wedding photo &quot; - i.e. recording holidays in special places , preferably waterfalls , some days after the festival , but in wedding clothes , explained Elisabeth Keidel .
many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday .
flower arrangements , rings , wedding panels , cakes and even a wizard , such as Marko Ripperger , who can entertain guests in style .
not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care .
everything for an unforgettable feast .
dog friends successful
for the repeated time , the athletes of dog lover Bitz have been successful on a Rally @-@ Obedience tournament .
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs ; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the class Beginner and secured fifth place , and with the 15 @-@ month @-@ old Marley he put it with 87 points on 12th .
Susi Höpp faced the critical gaze of the service judge with her woody in Class 1 .
parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accident believe in murder
the teenager &apos;s parents , whose body was found in a collapsed ridge in the gym of his high school , are convinced her son was murdered , the family &apos;s lawyer said Thursday .
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in an upright mat standing behind the grandstand in the school turntable .
the sheriff &apos;s investigative officers from Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , but that the 17 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s family was doubtful .
&quot; they are convinced that their son was murdered , &quot; Benjamin Crump , the lawyer for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , told FoxNews.com.
they would never have believed he had died as the sheriff concluded .
&quot; they believe that there is no logic whatsoever against the laws of physics as well as against common sense , &quot; Crump .
rather , they are convinced the truth will be covered to protect the person or persons responsible for their son &apos;s death .
&quot; her son went to school for learning and came back in the body bag , &quot; he commented .
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson &apos;s death as a number of important issues remain unresolved .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
that &apos;s what Moore said at a news conference Thursday afternoon .
I follow the facts in whatever direction they take .
my aim is to find out the truth .
&quot; I take the view that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation , &quot; he said .
Moore told reporters the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of the consequences of an &quot; opposition @-@ related suffocation . &quot;
a second autopsy , however , caused another cause of death , according to Moore .
&quot; there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , &quot; he said .
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson &apos;s death , he will instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation .
a representative of the County Sheriff &apos;s Authority was not immediately available for comment on our request on Thursday .
a court in southern Georgia ordered Wednesday that authorities must release all surveillance videos that investigators have reviewed .
the teenager &apos;s parents said they hoped the video records contained clues about how he died .
CDC release allergic lines for schools
on Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) released a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools .
these are the first such directives issued by the US government as the number of schoolchildren with food allergies increases .
one in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .
the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007 , according to the CDC .
the guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness among teachers and staff of food allergies and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions .
it is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin pretending - the auto injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used - to confront a potentially deadly oversensitivity response .
lawmakers in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can easily pre @-@ empt Epinephrin .
the report also includes a list of typical symptoms called by children who have an allergic reaction .
children might say , &quot; It feels as if something is pressed on my tongue , &quot; &quot; My tongue feels as if a hair is on it &quot; or &quot; my tongue crippling . &quot;
parents of intersex children can choose &apos; gender undetermined &apos;
Germany is the first European nation to recognise a third gender for children born with unambiguous genitals .
newborns are no longer given rigid male or female .
under the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but can specify &quot; undetermined &quot; or &quot; not defined &quot; on birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to take advantage of parents &apos; pressure to ensure they do not have to make rushed decisions regarding surgery for a sex assignment in newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .
an intersexual person said , according to the BBC years later , &quot; I &apos;m neither man nor woman . &quot;
I remain the patchwork created by doctors , mutilated and full of scars .
it is estimated that one in 2,000 children every year are neither a boy nor a girl .
they are among the intersexes , a group that falls under the diagnosis of &quot; sexual differentiation disorder &quot; ( DSD ) , a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , germ glands ( ovaries or testicles ) or unusually developed genitals .
Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexual .
the understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the United States advise that we should use the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding , if any , for an operation .
the New York psychiatrist Dr Jack Drescher , who specializes in the issue of gender identification , said the new German law &quot; captures after a good thing . &quot;
intersexual children pose an ethical dilemma .
&quot; some people have life @-@ threatening illnesses that require surgery , but for most children this does not apply , &quot; he said .
you can do a sexual assignment without surgery and then wait to see how identity develops .
the scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity at all is not very accurate .
no one knows why it is happening .
it &apos;s like the mystery of why people are gay .
a 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people , because their status is not gender @-@ based , but because of their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically defines both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them .
these characteristics were reflected in post @-@ secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , acidification , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or chromosomes and hormones .
the report also provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender persons in professional life , as well as the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice .
boys who are not equal to the gender picture now have a special camp .
meanwhile , in Australia and Nepal it is possible for adults to indicate male , female or &quot; third sex &quot; on official documents .
in June , Australian Norrie May @-@ Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world &apos;s first &quot; gender @-@ free &quot; person after a court granted life @-@ long retention of an &quot; unspecified &quot; gender status .
in addition to M and W , German cards will have a third assignment , X for intersex , according to the Interior Ministry .
in neighboring France , sex issues are still controversial , according to a news statement on France 24 .
in 2011 , dozens of French lawmakers of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition saying &quot; gender theory &quot; should be removed from school books .
the US website Catholic Online has also opposed German law , saying : &quot; if the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we are twisting two more pillars of civilisation . &quot;
the mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone she was better off when babies are assigned a gender at birth .
&quot; parents are already stressful enough even without further restrictions , especially if you don &apos;t know the gender of your own child , &quot; she told the parent website .
children need stability and security .
historically , children born both with male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites , according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes .
ten years ago , medicine regarded sex as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt .
but meanwhile , the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned after it is now known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they don &apos;t know how the child feels when growing up with the gender they allocate .
&quot; in the mid @-@ 20th century , you called this one , psychiatric emergencies , &quot; Drescher said .
when such a child was born , it was not the psychiatrist but the surgeon .
the ruling theory on the treatment of children with unambiguous genitals dates back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University , who considered that gender was formal .
he coined the term &quot; gender identity , &quot; arguing that social and environmental attacks - such as parents educate a child - interacted with a child &apos;s genes and hormones , preaching whether a person considers himself male or female .
but in a 1966 case known as &quot; John / Joan , &quot; his theories became controversial .
he advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from a botched circumcision , completely castrating the child and also removing his testicles and then raising him as a girl .
&quot; money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation , but it wasn &apos;t , &quot; Drescher added .
when the boy was about 15 , he moved back to male sex and married a woman .
with 38 , though , he committed suicide .
according to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .
but in the 1990s , with the entry of the Internet , survivors of these sexual operations have resigned to the public who are &quot; not happy with the outcome . &quot;
for example , at Jim Bruce , a 36 @-@ year @-@ old author from Montana who was born with XY @-@ male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals .
doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never lead a &quot; satisfying life &quot; as a man .
so his external body and testicles were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl .
at age 12 , he received female hormones .
&quot; I knew I wasn &apos;t a girl , &quot; he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy , but it was really hard to ask questions .
at age 18 , he should get a vaginal plastic .
but since he was depressed and knew something was wrong , he demanded his medical files .
what he found out was shocking .
I was sterilised at my birth - and none ever told me .
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals .
after he learned the truth , he moved back to male identity , received testosterone injections and allowed his breasts to be removed .
through the operation , he has become infertile .
today , he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal .
but Anne Tamar @-@ Mattis , managing director of California @-@ based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice , is concerned that German law can &quot; encourage defamation and stigma . &quot;
&quot; many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and allow the child not to be determined , &quot; she explained .
we fear this will encourage intervention .
we think it would be better to assign male or female sex and then wait to see it .
but we do not yet know how the law will affect it , so we can only speculate .
Tamar @-@ Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because &quot; it allows adults to recognise as a third sex . &quot;
&quot; adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , &quot; she explained .
German law is about assignment at birth .
this is not a struggle to force small children to do so .
if they are grown , they can decide on their own body .
but Dr. Arlene Baratz , a bruising scientist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self @-@ help group , says German law &quot; empowers &quot; both parents and children .
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called complete android resistance .
because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone , Katie developed female characteristics .
she has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .
today , Katie is 29 and married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry .
while it is infertile , it hopes to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .
&quot; the law gives parents room , which means they don &apos;t have to rush decisions , &quot; Baratz said .
it gives them the time to do different tests and clarify things and gives them time before writing &quot; male &quot; or &quot; female . &quot;
in this way everything is fine - you pull the child big and love it .
you have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parenthood .
and you don &apos;t have to rush an operation that can &apos;t be reversed .
&quot; this includes the children in the decision with one and removes the fear that parents are pushing because they believe they would not do the right thing , &quot; she explained .
ultimately , the child decides on the sex that suits him better - and that &apos;s wonderful .
this will enable children to make the decision themselves .
unknown hurt girl by shot from car
unknown have injured a 12 @-@ year @-@ old in Saxony @-@ Anhalt in shots from a car .
the offenders were believed to have fired at a group of children on Thursday night in Genthin .
that told police in castle .
the girl was easily injured at the left wade .
rescuers brought the girl to hospital .
the shot came from a small car that had passed past a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the offenders also shot at a bus stop .
a disc collapsed .
they then drove .
the crime police were investigating , it said Friday .
until now , police inspector Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night .
officials were called only twice to iron children who threw them against house facades .
since homeowners recognized this in time and removed the egg list immediately , no material damage should have been incurred .
also , some Sylvester boaters were lit in the city area , but no material damage was done here .
a resident in the Bishop &apos;s Friendorfer Way reported that his car was wrapped with cloth and his wheelchairs were stolen .
until the police arrived , however , the man rediscovered his wheelchairs in the immediate vicinity , so the police did not have to continue to act .
live with future prospects
in fact , Waltraud Ries lives fantastically .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green , an old tree stock , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .
it is only a few minutes by public transport .
&quot; you hopefully have no fear of spiders ? &quot; asks Waltraud Ries and shows up on a fat spider at the door frame .
I &apos;ve been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time .
but you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .
the reason , however , is not a spinning phobia , but a concern to no longer be able to cope at the age of the many steps to the house and in the apartment , she explains .
moreover , since a meniscus operation , the centre @-@ head has had to find out what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap .
just recently , a book of her appeared on the subject of &apos; Happiness living in age - What kind of living is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos;Our apartment is the best example of what &apos;s not going on at the age &apos; , she begins to tell .
when she moved into the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago with her husband , it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today with mid @-@ fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks otherwise .
she also knows , however , that she is one of the few people who is even dealing with the subject of &apos; living at age &apos; .
most outnumber it as long as it goes .
old always become just the others &apos; , she says chuckling .
only when suffering pressure is really great do you think .
&apos;then it can be too late , &apos; Ries added .
in her book , the interior designer presents 17 apartment models for a self @-@ contained living in old age .
&apos;What kind of living you choose is always an individual decision &apos; , she explains .
d i e solution there is not for age .
even those who can afford the pension in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could become ill .
and : &apos; without a good knowledge of the national language , one can also consider in the Dolce Vita &apos; .
among their models are classic care models , alternative living forms or the often cited pensioner WG .
at age , everyone has such their kicks and Macken
&apos;for me , however , such a residential community would be nothing &apos; , she thinks with an eye @-@ catcher .
not at all as in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen .
&apos;at age you just need his back rooms too , &apos; according to Ries .
however , the fact that a senior housing community can still work does not want to exclude the accountant .
but that must be different from the traditional student WG .
and sometimes you just want his calm , too , &apos; she believes .
with this opinion , it is not alone in the state capital .
&apos;Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home for so long &apos; is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of civil service life at the age of the state capital .
her department is advising people around the subject of &apos; becoming older &apos; .
the experience of the Warentest Foundation is therefore also very important .
there are many possibilities today to make the house or apartment accessible .
Ries recommends that anyone who deals with the age @-@ appropriate reconstruction of their home or apartment should first be thoroughly informed and not be entrusted with the first @-@ best craftsman .
today there are also specialists for age @-@ appropriate reconstruction .
even in the rental apartment this can be realized one way or another , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior architect clarifies .
but it is not always possible to transform the existing apartment into old @-@ age and thus accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .
that experience had to make Waltraud Ries .
it is possible to install a staircase inside the apartment , which is also paved with stairs to the front door , but that would be a far greater obstacle .
she will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband .
before moving it grates more than before the spider at her apartment door .
U.S. wants Snowden to continue prosecuting
the U.S. has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence worker Edward Snowden .
he is still accused of passing unauthorised secret information .
he must therefore face criminal proceedings in the US , the US State Department spokeswoman , Jennifer Psaki , said in Washington .
Snowden &apos;s recent remarks would not change that either .
before that , German Green politician Hans @-@ Christian Flubele appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to avoid threatening him further with punishment .
Psaki stressed that currents concerned one parliamentarian rather than one German member of government .
intelligence Secretary Edward Snowden is in principle ready to meet with German authorities .
first , however , he wants to know his situation .
that made clear to the former NSA employee sought by the US in an unaddressed letter published by Green politician Hans @-@ Christian Flubele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and passed on to the federal government , Bundestag and general counsel .
the letter , according to a translation published by currents , is as follows :
to the beneficiaries
I was asked to write to you about your inquiry into mass surveillance .
I called Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contracted or employed by a direct order as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .
in the course of my work in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of the laws of my government , which led me to act on moral duty .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent hatred which forced me to leave my family and my home country .
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .
citizens around the world , and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations to be a system of all @-@ encompassing surveillance that is not guilty of any accountability to anyone as a service to the public .
these espionage revelations drew many suggestions on new laws and guidelines aimed at previously covert abuses of public confidence .
the benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear , while at the same time the risks taken into account have been clearly reduced .
although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a filibuster , seeking to criminalise and prosecute political expression .
yet the truth is not a crime .
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will adopt this unacceptable position .
I hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media , particularly in terms of the truth and authenticity of the reports .
I look forward to having a meeting with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all .
Edward Snowden testifies by Hans @-@ Christian Flubele
kindergarten has found a private buyer
&quot; the building is in good hands , &quot; says winter leagues Mayor Michael Maier .
the former kindergarten in the Garden Road has sold the commune to a private person .
the sale was agreed in the non @-@ public part by the local council at its recent meeting .
the building changed its owner at a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the community is satisfied , &quot; Maier points out .
the budget was EUR 100 000 .
it is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten .
the mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and therefore no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house , how to heat , look after the garden and clear the sidewalk .
&quot; this effort is now gone , &quot; Maier is pleased .

Chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music pieces .
Honeck thanked all those who had helped successfully manage the first music hock .
report : Obama campaign to replace Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama &apos;s closest advisers have been considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 campaign with Hillary Clinton , according to the New York Times .
the revelation is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin &apos;s long @-@ awaited work and John Heilemann on the 2012 campaign , &quot; Double Down : game Change 2012 . &quot;
the Times has a copy of the soon @-@ to @-@ be book and reported on Thursday night that the president &apos;s top advisers had conducted &quot; extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011 &quot; to find out whether it would be better for Obama &apos;s declining hope of re @-@ election if he dropped Biden .
according to Jonathan Martin , national political correspondent for the Times , the book thoroughly tracks the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House staff , notably former White House chief of staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect it has on poll numbers to swap former Secretary Clinton against the vice president .
the potential change was a closely watched secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office .
only half a dozen of the president &apos;s closest advisers - including Daley , the former campaign manager of Obama , Jim Messina , and the White House &apos;s former senior adviser , David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew about the planned change .
in &quot; Double Down , &quot; it is claimed that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her &quot; close , personal relationship , &quot; before eventually deciding against such a move , after the data showed that Clinton &apos;s candidacy &quot; would not significantly improve Obama &apos;s chances . &quot;
in an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government was actually considering replacing Biden with Clinton .
&quot; I said a whole series of things to consider , and that was one of them , &quot; Daley told the magazine .
one has to remember that the president had terrible poll numbers at the time , so we thought , &quot; To God &apos;s will , what are we doing ? &quot;
while Daley described the investigations as &quot; necessary care , &quot; Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re @-@ election , significant efforts had been made to determine whether such a train would pay off in terms of the polls .
&quot; in campaigns , not so much money is spent on polls and focus groups unless you seriously think about something , &quot; Martin explained on AC360 .
but it &apos;s not clear whether Obama knew his team was thinking about an exchange .
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his current boss had known about the potential change .
although Daley explained he did not believe the president was &quot; aware of the possible change , &quot; the former chief of staff admitted it was &quot; possible &quot; that Obama knew about it .
Martin added that &quot; Double Down &quot; did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political explorations had reached Obama &apos;s desk .
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thinks Obama knew nothing about the investigation into whether Biden should be dropped in the elections .
&quot; possible , &quot; Martin replied .
what happens to my e @-@ mail ?
e @-@ mail actually means electronic letter .
has e @-@ mail , similar to conventional mail , been technically implemented in the design of the Internet service ?
when designing early Internet services , the emphasis was on making communication possible .
as a result , the basic technical protocols did not ensure a stable foundation for an audible exchange of letters .
therefore , a conventional e @-@ mail corresponds more to an open postcard than a sealed letter .
if user sends &quot; Anna &quot; to &quot; Benni , &quot; are the computers of the two connected directly ?
Anna &apos;s e @-@ mail program or browser sends the mail to her service provider &apos;s mail server in the first step .
if she has a Gmail account , for example , that would be Google .
this mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses .
on the route , the mail can run through several other servers on the Internet .
Bennie can then call the content to his provider .
are conventional e @-@ mails on their way through the network ?
most mails are read several times by software robots .
the sender provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an appendix .
a virus check is also done on the receiver systems .
in addition , providers check whether it is a troublesome and unwelcome spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted into a spam folder .
do the robots have another task ?
for systems such as GMail , the robot also identifies the information Google needs to place context advertising .
if Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip , Google can hide related links to holiday deals .
do unknown people also read the emails ?
the likelihood of unauthorized people reading a mail is extremely low .
in theory , however , that is possible .
in companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .
law enforcement and intelligence agencies also have legal means to intercept or take note of e @-@ mails .
this will result in possible illegal exit actions .
is it possible to protect emails against reading ?
with a encryption according to the OpenPGP standard , an email can be encrypted effectively against reading .
with great technical effort , it is also possible to conceal the metadata of e @-@ mail communication , so that it is not even possible to recognize who has communicated with whom .
how important are Yahoo and Google on the e @-@ mail market in Germany ?
for the mainly privately used post offices , Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role , according to an investigation by Convios Consulting from August 2013 .
while Yahoo Mail &apos;s shares had recently fallen , GMail was able to clear from Google .
mother buried in woods and retired
when his beaten mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .
he committed the deaths in a forest - and continued to castigate her pension and foster care .
to continue to castigate pensions and foster care , a 67 @-@ year @-@ old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother in the woods after investigating police .
first , he covered up the death of 89 @-@ year @-@ olds , then he passed the money for more than a year and a half .
now the 67 @-@ year @-@ old has to answer for fraud , a spokesman said Friday .
so the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .
it was suspected that the man was already in May : at the time it appeared that no drugs were needed for the nursing mother .
investigators told the pensioner his mother had travelled to Spain .
because the officers made this odd , they continued to investigate .
it emerged that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and that he had recently maintained it .
the 67 @-@ year @-@ old eventually acknowledged his mother &apos;s death .
an obituary showed no evidence of a capital crime , according to police .
fancy ice cream lit in the dark ?
a British entrepreneur has developed the first shining ice in the dark - using ankles .
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a shining leakage .
the idea came to him after he read a research work on anguish and persuaded Chinese scientists to artificially produce the shining protein .
the ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue , increasing the pH value in the protein and triggering the light .
Chris explains that the esophagus responded to the warmth in the mouth and shine - the more you leak , the brighter it becomes .
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company &quot; Lick Me I &apos;m Delicious , &quot; says : &quot; the product is incredible but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . &quot;
the protein used in the ice cream responds with the tongue at a neutral pH value .
when the mouth warms the protein , the pH value rises and the ice lights up .
we &apos;ve tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful luminous effect .
it &apos;s probably the most expensive ice cream I &apos;ve ever produced , because the qualms are four times more expensive than gold .
every bullet costs me about £ 140 .
but it tastes delicious .
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors , which include beer , cheese , beef and leaf gold .
but his latest creation is expected to be even more ambitious .
he says , &quot; I like to develop an invisible ice cream . &quot;
this is by and for itself impossible because of the light break caused by the ice crystals that make ice cream ; but I suspect we find a way to create it .
ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a quake artificially produced by Chinese scientists
the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Verbandsliga after six days .
out now , it comes for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first win last weekend .
with this game , the season starts new for us .
&quot; I hope we finally have your head free , &quot; Ehler &apos;s behavior is optimistic .
in doing so , he finally has his complete caddie , with the exception of the permanent injured Hendrik Blohme .
Daverden also relies on pace play as we do .
we must therefore minimise our error rate .
first and foremost , however , it is important to increase coverage , which , most recently , has left anything but a safe impression .
clearly more relaxed is Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz after the first season &apos;s victory against Nordhorn .
the game was , of course , a house number .
but that &apos;s why we &apos;re not the favorite yet , because in Derby everything can always happen .
however , Panitz now wants to put in Morsum to start a series .
missing will be Jan @-@ Malte Jodat .
for this , the A @-@ teenager Joost Windßuss , who is active with double play law at the A @-@ Youth Bundesliga HC Bremen , celebrates his season debut .
those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .
Halloween 2013 : in numbers
when I was small , Halloween had something magical .
my sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood .
today I have become more like the Halloween muffel .
over the past two years , I have not agreed to distribute from my home to candy , and I am not likely to do so this year either .
but according to statistics , I &apos;m a black sheep as far as Halloween is concerned .
the majority of Americans - 158 million to be exact - celebrate Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes and decorations , according to the U.S. Association of Retailers ( NRF ) .
one thing I look forward to every Halloween then is the trend values .
the costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .
this year , exciting uneventful items are the last scream .
women no longer have to hide in sexy clothes , they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburger or carrots .
as for men , I expect plenty of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet the Daft @-@ Punk space men will make it into the Instagram feeds this year .
according to Google , the most sought @-@ after costumes are zombies , Batman , pirates and witches .
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition .
we dressed our dogs last year and were not alone in my astonishment .
in fact , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , according to the NRF .
these are a lot of &quot; Hot Dogs . &quot;
as far as sweets are concerned , we are not stupid .
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielsen Company .
that &apos;s about 270 million kilograms of chocoruses , lutters , bonbons and rubber bones .
so good news for the 41 million people , according to the U.S. Department of Commerce , who move through the neighborhoods with the spike &quot; sweet or saures . &quot;
in fact , we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - let &apos;s do nothing before - eat .
the only thing we don &apos;t want to consume is the sugary Candy Corn ; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween , according to the National Association of freshmen manufacturers .
that &apos;s about nine billion corn grains .
it &apos;s a mystery I couldn &apos;t solve yet .
nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it spilled .
they have great names like &quot; Terror Behind the Walls &quot; ( which , incidentally , is in a real prison ) , &quot; Howl @-@ O @-@ Scream &quot; and &quot; The House of Shock . &quot;
there are actually 1,200 officially recognized Spukhouses in the United States that generate $ 500 million in proceeds , according to America Haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pinch yourself into the pants and then put the friends on Facebook , where you won &apos;t get rid of them again , and one then the type on which you can comment . &quot;
but let &apos;s finally get to the pumpkins .
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great pumpkin when we were kids , and cutting a pumpkin dish is like decorating the Christmas tree - something we made from small to small .
fortunately , the &quot; baby in the pumpkin &quot; trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it .
this year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkins , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
pumpkins , which slowly rotates in the front yard , is believed to be from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year .
if you want to score correctly , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut something awkward from their 921 kilos of heavy pumpkin .
housing fire in Helmbrecht : rescuers trapped body
the fire brigade had to leave in Helmbrecht late Thursday night .
a DREIFAMILIENHAUS in the District Court catches fire on the night of Friday .
the rescue workers hold a concealed corpse from the house .
rescuers found a concealed corpse in a DREIFAMILIENHAUS on a fire in Helmbrecht .
whether it was a resident is still unclear , as a spokesman for police in Bayreuth said .
late Thursday night , it had burned on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire brigade arrived , the flames were already fired from a window .
the troops went to the apartment and found the corpse in a room .
this and another room burned out completely .
the entire ground floor was damaged .
all other residents were not at home during the Brands , the police spokesman continued .
the building is no longer habitable .
the exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .
Germany &apos;s largest provincial church has launched an open @-@ water vegetarian to promote the pastor &apos;s profession .
background is a possible lack of parish : the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover reckons that the number of its current population of around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030 .
for young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) said in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .
it is attractive to be able to determine the course of work and the day .
with Burfien , for the first time the National Church has hired a pastor on a full site to inspire young people for the theologiadium .
at present , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology .
Burfien attributed this to the process of defamation : &quot; God &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud . &quot;
the profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .
I am the Lord of my Calendar and I can set my priorities where it is important to me .
pastors could be very close to people as a saint .
they earned as much as teachers and could live well .
certainly more will be paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer .
this goes against the young people of today , who are not just about career , but about a sinister work .
according to the National Church , which includes three @-@ quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors are currently retiring each year .
at the same time , about 40 graduates from a theologian workshop start their vikariat .
in sparsely populated peripheral areas , such as Harz , Emsland or Wendland , it will be difficult to fill posts in future .
Burfien , among other things , wants to organise study days for young people and invite celebrities who have studied theology .
the Theologiestudium offers a broad education .
you can even become a federal president .
land Rover Rally Series announced
in the interior you will find race seats and six @-@ point belts as well as a free @-@ kick .
the options range from increased brakes , a service package with support from Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .
Drew Bowler , managing director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : &quot; the rally customers coming to Bowler have changed . &quot;
they are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure , as well as following an achievable path to world @-@ class events .
we are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format will provide new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the strains and the reality of Rally Raid .
we really had fun developing the Defender Challenge car - that will be an entertaining championship .
in addition , the Defender Challenge has a training and testing day in February , as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .
fire brigade called to rescue a bitch that stuck 15 feet above the ground on a dangerous rock front in a quarry
Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby was off after a minor traffic accident
three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her dismal location
firefighters roamed on rock wall and rescued the dog before the safe death
the fire brigade managed to bring a bitch to safety that stuck on a 15 @-@ metre lead in a rock wall .
the nine @-@ month @-@ old Cockerspaniel @-@ bitch Ruby ran away after a traffic accident Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday .
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 , who owns the dog , came to the quarry flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire , to get Ruby back to reception and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .
they had desperately searched for their missing bitch and released helplines on social networks when they escaped into the quarry after the small traffic accident .
about 2 : 15 p.m. on Wednesday , a walker who executed his dog saw stranded Ruby on the 15 @-@ metre high paragraph in the quarry .
the Cleckheaton Fire Station &apos;s technical rescue team rushed to the spot and roamed to rescue Rubys , who was then transported to the top in a dog box .
Andy Clayton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : &quot; she was in a dangerous situation .
it was in the middle of the rock wall - 15 metres from the top and the bottom .
she didn &apos;t move a muscle during her rescue - she was like stiff .
but now she &apos;s doing well .
she then eaten a few dog pie .
this was a pretty unusual bet .
the fact that the dog has been discovered is incredible .
Peter Lau , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : &quot; Ruby had a giant accident . &quot;
there was a possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse .
Ruby was taken to the vet for investigation , but he did not establish anything except exhaustion and dehydration .
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : &quot; to watch the rescue was frightening . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t even believe she was really up there .
it was wonderful to keep them back in the arms .
the veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too large and it had collapsed , it would probably have crashed .
the firefighters have done great things .
it was really brave what they did .
we &apos;re just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .
Scott Alderson from Kishley added : &quot; we were afraid she would fall down but she stayed up . &quot;
the firefighters were great .
I can hardly believe where she was .
Mick Jagger explains he never hired Katy Perry when she was 18 .
during an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger &apos;s song &quot; Old Habits The Hard &quot; from 2004 .
Perry explained that she had eaten with the Altrocker at night , and that &quot; he begged me when I was 18 . &quot;
she added : &quot; this has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . &quot;
in a statement , a representative told Jaggers , 70 , on Thursday that he &quot; categorically denied that he had ever made any rapprochement attempts at Katy Perry . &quot;
the representative added : &quot; maybe she confused him with someone else . &quot;
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at this year &apos;s Rolling Stones tour .
her new album &quot; Prism &quot; landed at Anhieb at No. 1 this week .
George Kerevan : European unbundling gives Scots the choice
a new day , a new horror story on independence .
this time we are being warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .
this provides the cue for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrianswall .
indeed , the Strathclyde proposal pointed to the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but , as expected , this played no part in the headlines .
nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often turn their back on strict rules when they are more favourable to them .
as Scotland does not currently belong to the Schengen area , the continued non @-@ respect for Brussels would be just a small concession in exchange for what is really wanted by the Scots .
so really no story .
and one that has already come in the years that it already resembles a fossil : the first time I &apos;ve heard the &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; duck at least 40 years ago .
an interesting point is lost in the constant recovery of this ancient history .
why do we expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe ?
why swap the London yoke against that of Brussels , especially now ?
these are the real European news : the great plan for the unification of Europe , drawn up after the war , has stalled .
with the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .
across the EU , parties gain ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro on board as a common currency .
even in Germany , the Eurosceptic Party was able to gain an alternative to Germany - only this year - almost five million votes in the federal election in September , effectively dropping the Free Democrats ( the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats ) out of the Bundestag .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .
however , the current economic crisis is emerging as a turning point .
because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , combined with the straitjacket to which the national economy is coerced by holding onto the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .
the euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits - that was the case only in Greece .
instead , the Eurosystem has fixed its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters - and that is what German politicians would like to leave .
without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern Europe finds itself again with a built @-@ in productivity disadvantage vis @-@ à @-@ vis Germany .
the only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred by Berlin .
there is a deep European productivity problem behind the current budgetary and monetary problems .
as a result of the &quot; green &quot; energy guidelines imposed by Brussels - a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry is paying double for electricity and four times for gas compared with the United States .
this is a crippling cost axe , as we could already see in Grangemouth .
all the world &apos;s wage rules do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .
as a result , a revolt is drawing up , particularly in France , the EU &apos;s former cheerleader .
after the war , France &apos;s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and lift Paris to an equal footing with Washington .
but Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe into its own economic policy , which is struggling the struggling French economy .
the result is that Marine Le Pen &apos;s right @-@ wing , anti @-@ EU National Front has just won a crucial post @-@ election election , drawing the ruling Socialists to three .
the National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a split on the right spectrum would automatically bring benefits to the left .
what does Le Pen do with her newly won popularity among the white French working class ?
it wants to use next year &apos;s EU elections to forge an anti @-@ EU , anti @-@ Community monetary bloc in the European Parliament .
if the anti @-@ EU parties do well in these elections - and this is very possible - then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .
this is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will be found together to abolish the euro .
the EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the &quot; Europe of the ( sovereign ) nations &quot; that General de Gaulle favored .
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may stick to the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of becoming part of the US .
however , Washington &apos;s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain .
where does Scotland stay with all this ?
we can decide to be a region of ( lately ) Klein @-@ England .
or we can defend our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can put in place .
I suspect Scotland could go well in a looser European interconnection , provided we keep our own currency .
cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederal Europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider doing so with Norway and maintaining our economic independence .
the SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed ( and anticipated ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory @-@ Lib Dem coalition .
it would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now , only to have austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .
early puberty : growing faster
African @-@ American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers , as investigations show .
physical changes don &apos;t mean immediate puberty
there is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
experts believe the epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
the trend for early puberty is less pronounced among boys
former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family affairs .
should a mother be concerned if her daughter is already growing breasts and shamhairs aged seven or eight ?
at the annual conference of the Children &apos;s Medical Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando , Florida , pediatric endocrine scientist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm .
&quot; I spend a lot of time calming parents - normally this is no sign that now the puberty is rapidly entering , &quot; explained Kaplowitz .
obvious ads of development , such as growing breasts , sham- and ashes , as well as body smell , show up in girls earlier .
still , there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche ( occurrence of the first rule blood ) over the last 40 years .
in the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .
&quot; when the development of the breasts begins , it still takes at least two to three years to menarche , &quot; said Kaplowitz , also author of the book &quot; Early Puberty in Girls : the essential counselor to deal with this frequently occurring problem . &quot;
time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .
it is controversial , which actually marks the beginning of puberty , but it is &quot; premature &quot; for breast enlargement to be accompanied by an increase of eight years ago .
in most cases , the process slows or stagnates - something a pediatrician can closely monitor .
in case of faster progress , tests could be displayed by an endikronologist , so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded .
there are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and defenses of another episode : the early aging of the bones , which can ultimately lead to growth and thus small body growth in adults .
the recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , development speed , growth rate and emotional maturity .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs , but he admits : &quot; the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their peers . &quot;
the other big problem is understandable : parents simply don &apos;t want their very young daughters to have the period .
&quot; they worry about pregnancy risk or about how they handle the hygienic side , &quot; Kaplowitz said .
&quot; it was a shock , &quot; recalls a woman whose daughter got her days with 10 .
even though there were initial signs and we had talked about menstruation , she was emotionally unprepared .
she came terrified and excited from school home because she was the first in her circle of friends .
there are many widely publicized theories about the causes of early puberty .
but there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be cause .
young people come to puberty similar to girls earlier .
Kaplowitz believes the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity .
he supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine , creating a link between body fat and entering puberty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .
in this country , African @-@ American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers .
there are different explanations for this .
global seems to have an early puberty influenced by all sorts of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .
another mystery : although boys are growing facial and shamusement earlier , the trend towards full @-@ blown earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls .
other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue .
the emergence of acne and shamhaar is common even among babies and infants .
&quot; we need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty , &quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrine scientist at Goryeb Children &apos;s Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .
parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician how they should talk to their child .
&quot; that can mean you have to have a conversation sooner than expected , &quot; Mr. Kaplowitz advised .
if you stay calm , the child usually responds well .
girls who fled early need insurance , which the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than thought .
jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders over seat width
between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been a clash over the breadth of seats in the tourist class on long @-@ haul flights , giving the tone for a bitter clash on the Dubai Airshow this month .
the dispute revolves around the seating range offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class - not always those who seek the most airlines , but this designated space is the key to the efficiency of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that requires a seating width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US archrival Boeing says that should be the airlines &apos; choice .
the clash comes at a time when aircraft makers are weathering to sell even larger versions of their two @-@ engine long @-@ haul aircraft , and at the event expect record orders from November 17 to 21 .
how the rear part of the aircraft is designed - especially whether there are rows with nine or ten seats - is crucial to the economic results indicated to deliver the new &quot; mini @-@ jumbo &quot; design .
Boeing claims its modernized &quot; 777X &quot; fibre 406 people at seats in the tourist class , which are over 17 inches wide , allowing 10 per row .
Airbus declares that the competing version of the A350 is carrying 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .
aircraft giants often share Hiebe with technical details via advertising in the specialist press .
now Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race .
recently , the company unveiled an ad that could be the start of a new ad war and donors showed a picture in which three people clashed in a restaurant , and the title : &quot; would you accept that ? &quot;
&quot; Boeing is proposing long @-@ haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo @-@ props , &quot; says Airbus sales chief John Leahy .
given changed diet habits , people are becoming thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .
between the early 1970s , when the Boeing 747 defined modern long @-@ haul travel , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average American increased by 10 percent between 40 and 49 years , according to data from the U.S. Department of Health .
the Tailleness of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm , according to U.S. health statistics .
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seating concept from the 1950s , when the average body range of the freshly tinted &quot; Jet Set &quot; was narrower .
according to Airbus , investigations were carried out which showed that an additional inch ( 2.54 cm ) per seat would increase sleep quality by 53 percent .
Boeing denies Airbus figures to the seats and says it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines are shaping the balance between airline fares and establishment .
the company also explains , according to investigations , the experience on the plane depends on more than the seat width .
&quot; it really is running out to give airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to be successful , &quot; explains Boeing &apos;s air carrier expert Kent Craver .
they don &apos;t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .
they know their business better than anyone else .
passengers are about more elbow @-@ free , but for manufacturers it becomes increasingly an issue that can affect turnover .
behind the clash is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe &apos;s export balance .
as Reuters first reported in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the clash over the new jets .
both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat at their latest two @-@ engine long @-@ range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365 @-@ seat Boeing 77 @-@ 300ER .
the statements Boeings made on the results are partly due to the fact that the 777X is compared with its 10 seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .
the increased costs per unit are still lower than those of currently used machines with ten seats per row .
&quot; Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products , &quot; says Kevin Keniston , head of passenger comfort at European Airbus .
on the other hand , analysts say , full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for closer arrangement , which could involve cheaper air fares .
&quot; eighteen inches of seating would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat posed by the 777 , &quot; says Mary Kirby , an expert on cabin equipment , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose .
the world @-@ wide jet vendors even contribute bandwidth to gauge the facility at the competition .
even if they price comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with high @-@ density design for low @-@ cost airlines and regional flights .
Airbus offers a 10 @-@ seat A350 , but has not yet sold one .
until recently , Airbus has stressed the importance of more adaptability of cabins and offered broad seats on the aisles for some jets .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to fizzle , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .
new anti @-@ nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking the guard
scientists have developed an anti @-@ nicotine vaccine that could spoil fun at smoking .
a single dose of the vaccine could protect mice a lifetime from nicotine addiction .
before tests on humans , further attempts are needed , which may take some years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial results were good .
&quot; we are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit while trying out all the methods available on the market , but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , &quot; Cornell concluded .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed to include genetic information to produce nicotine antibodies .
the virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a constant stream of antibodies .
the antibodies chase nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain , leaving a smoker not to learn nicotine high .
in trials , vaccinated mice administered by nicotine kept their normal levels of activity .
mice without vaccination , by contrast , had taken an &quot; out of time , &quot; the researchers said , a sign that the nicotine had reached her brain .
the experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine .
previous tobacco vaccines failed because they included antibodies .
the vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody that they were expensive and impractical .
but the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower because it turns liver cells into antibody convertibles .
as Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for people , if quite certain , would be administered children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , thus preventing nicotine addiction .
more likely , though , is that smokers would use him to stop .
&quot; they then know : when they start smoking again , they feel no pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to lay off the habit , &quot; he explains .
British scientists said the results were interesting but at the same time warned that further research was needed .
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
an investigation is being launched by the state corruption watchdog against former Labor Party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales .
the former NSW minister denies having changed the rules on martial arts at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid , who owned covert holdings in three plots on state @-@ controlled land .
on Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC ) extended its investigations into whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend lease contracts at Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without a call for tender after its expiration in August 2005 .
now it is being investigated because of the allegation that Tripodi has known Obeid &apos;s covert interest in the plots after Tripodi &apos;s former deputy chief executive Lynne Ashpole testified accordingly on Thursday .
in years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pressed for public tenders for lease contracts .
the runners were opposed and also wanted longer running time .
in 2009 , lease contracts for the companies at Circular Quay , which raised $ 2.5 million a year to the Obeids , were extended without a public tender .
Tripodi , who was Port Minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , had originally advocated public tenders .
but he denied making the changes at the request of Obeid , who , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for a reorganisation of the government &apos;s lease arrangements .
one of the ICAC &apos;s telephone records showed talks dating back to August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had moved to the Port Ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority .
&quot; was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the elaboration of commercial lending arrangements ? &quot; asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi .
&quot; no , &quot; Tripodi replied .
I can &apos;t remember what was discussed , but it definitely wasn &apos;t .
definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .
Israeli warplanes attack target in Syria , according to official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia Thursday night , a senior government official confirmed to Fox News .
the official did not explain what the target was , but said it was at least one .
according to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA @-@ 125 missiles .
at least twice this year , Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile supplies in Syria .
foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to &quot; dental testing &quot;
the government is considering expanded measures on an &quot; authenticity test &quot; for foreign workers with 457 visas .
if the test is introduced , it would be used through a criterion to prevent the 457 being used for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for the access of family and friends to Australia .
a government discussion proposal was published today after the Labor Party &apos;s former MP , Maxine McKew , condemned the government &apos;s comments regarding foreign workers because they could be seen as an insult by Australia &apos;s neighbors .
&quot; loud statements like , foreigners are supposed to backfire &quot; and , Australians first hire &quot; are a very uncomfortable setback at times when unions demanded a protected labor market , &quot; she told the Australia India Institute today .
historically , this meant that white workers should be protected - and if some in the region worsen an echo of this historic artifact , I would not be surprised .
the discussion proposal outlines 12 measures once devised by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .
immigration Minister Brendan O &apos;Connor , who insisted yesterday on talks on human smuggling in Sri Lanka , has implemented five of the recommended changes , while others are still being considered .
if the &quot; authenticity criterion &quot; is accepted , someone requesting a visa could be checked to determine whether &quot; the application is real in cases where the applicant is related to or connected with the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company . &quot;
firms could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after , in the past , hundreds of companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers finally stopped .
meanwhile , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on Christmas Island .
the troubled nine @-@ year @-@ old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin since his father &apos;s death on Wednesday , who was also on the boat .
Australian authorities brought the man to Christmas Island Hospital where he died .
a study has been announced by the UK government to increase the benefits of the hs2 rail project for Scotland .
in the work of hs2 Ltd , it is proposed to achieve high @-@ speed connections between Scotland and the north of England at the start of Phase 1 in 2026 .
transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project &quot; will bring Britain closer together . &quot;
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was delighted to work with the British government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high @-@ speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .
after completing Phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .
in June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high @-@ speed road between London and Nordengland from £ 32.7 billion to £ 42.6 billion .
the British government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has hired hs2 Ltd to look for further stretch capacity and travel time improvements for Nordengland and Scotland .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of eventually three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .
Baroness Kramer said : &quot; our goal for hs2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . &quot;
we are moving forward with hs2 because it brings enormous benefits .
without it , we face a capacity crisis on our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improving thanks to hs2 .
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : &quot; today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland . &quot;
on behalf of the Scottish government , Keith Brown called on Carmichael to commit himself &quot; unequivocally &quot; to Scottish involvement in the hs2 network .
brown said : &quot; the high @-@ speed rail link carries the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time it also provides Scotland &apos;s economic strength an argument for fast rail connections across the UK . &quot;
that is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high @-@ speed rail link in Scotland , which creates benefits for everyone and complements the Glasgow @-@ Edinburgh connection that the Scottish Government already plans to do .
I look forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British ministers next year and to adopting the next steps together .
rules on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian airline passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at launch and landing , despite efforts in the U.S. to loosen regulations on such devices .
the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so passengers can read e @-@ books , watch or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases , provided they are in &quot; flight mode . &quot;
during most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e @-@ books when starting and landing .
Australian companies are monitoring the decision to implement them , but are not pursuing immediate plans to amend their rules .
CASA &apos;s air traffic control agency also said it will look at the announcement , but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply .
&quot; CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices on the aircraft , &quot; it was announced .
the issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at any time and to comply with safety instructions given by cabin crew .
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about an extension of its Wi @-@ Fi entertainment system on flights and has said that it is open to change , but it must be initiated by the legislator .
&quot; we would welcome a review of the licensing of electronic devices by CASA because we are convinced this would improve customer experience after we now offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , &quot; a spokesman said .
Qantas explained that you will stick to current regulations until further notice .
&quot; our current guidelines provide that electronic devices should not be used when starting and landing , and we currently have no plans to change that , &quot; the company said .
the FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations that allow passengers to benefit and will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision varies between US companies depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their planes can tolerate the radio disruptions through mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer support .
&quot; after an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , light electronic devices such as tablets , e @-@ book readers and smartphones at any rate , &quot; the FAA announced .
in rare cases in bad sight , the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment while landing .
the group also recommended stowing heavier devices safely under the seat or in the subjects above the seat at launch and landing .
in front of the Revierderby against Schalke , BVB followers with light trailers provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .
Borussia Dortmund then announced tough consequences .
before Friday &apos;s match of the Football League against VfB Stuttgart , the Ultras responded with a silence - first .
it was an unfamiliar , almost ghostly acoustics that offered to the viewer until shortly before the launch of the Bundesliga match between German vice @-@ president Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park .
most of the guests were listening to their songs .
the southern gallery , on the other hand , where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand , first presented itself exceptionally quietly : no vocals , no raids .
the podium of the Capo , which otherwise coordinates joint blast , remained unoccupied .
and at the front of the gallery , a large flag with inscription &quot; Section Stadionban . &quot;
only as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller , as always , entered the square as the first BVB player , did short @-@ lived jubilation .
when his team @-@ mates followed , there were loud singing and hurling scarves - but far from everywhere .
there was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern gallery .
also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel recounted the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbysieg , victory over Arsenal , extension of the contract of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not create a celebration .
only five minutes before the capo &apos;s start , his podium - and the tension , which until then can be seen with his hands , escaped in a loud scream when Dickel , as usual , asked the mood on the ranks at the stadium .
last , as always , the southern gallery was on the line - and at last here again was the loudest place in the stadium .
and , at the latest , when with Anpfiff coming from the southern gallery , the loud call &quot; Derbysieger stands up , &quot; was again all like ever .
the silence previously was probably a reaction to what has happened in recent days .
just before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04 , some of the most accomplished BVB supporters fired Leuchtraketen into the spectators and into the place - hitting almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller .
the game was punched late because of the chaotic scenes .
BvB boss Hans @-@ Joachim Watzke had received the tips of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and believe Watzke &apos;s words , this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives .
&quot; there will be massive cuts for the entire ultramotion , &quot; the BVB boss announced on Thursday night at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .
as an immediate measure , Watzke told the Ultras a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart .
&quot; I banned that , &quot; he explained .
we cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .
in addition , the Ultras have been shown various ways of punishing them - by Tuesday , these now have time to choose one .
otherwise , Watzke said , BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week .
&quot; it &apos;s going to be cutting down , &quot; Watzke assured .
we must be eager to see what the reactions are in the southern gallery .
Pfandbrief booms in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
in a Pfandbrief in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga swaps a golden wriggle , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay their daughters &apos; school fees .
&quot; my husband and I just bought a house , there &apos;s all my money in it , &quot; Amirthalinga says .
although she dived 3,000 Singapore dollars ( ca 1,730 euros ) each month as an administrative employee and her husband also works , the monthly family income is not enough , she explains .
indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where household debt is increasing - is so large that ValueMax , where it has made its exchange , became the third Pfandbrief listed on the singapuric stock exchange this week .
botched jewelry is not only a quick way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga - but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan .
typically , Pfandhouses in Singapore require an effective annual rate of 17 percent , just above the 15.4 percent required by United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall .
however , Pfandbrief offers the advantage that there is no need for a review of creditworthiness or income evidence , which is why loans can be made faster than banks .
this is why millions of people in the region are turning to Pfandhouses after families feel pressure from rising living costs as well as increased household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit , owing to loose fiscal policies in developed economies , families with lower and middle @-@ income mortgages are looking to offset the difference in stalling economies .
this week , the ratings agency called Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s growing fiscal debt , mainly due to rising mortgages , a risk factor for the credit rating of Asian banks .
Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore , according to the agency , have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product .
Malaysia stands at 80 percent of GDP at the top of the list , an increase of 60 percent still in 2008 .
economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which this week has just come out of a technical recession .
on Thursday , the data showed continued export weakness and a drop in consumer demand .
&quot; ultimately , that means that given rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible , &quot; says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .
historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have exacerbated the trend of eating personal items as people seize the opportunity to turn the family &apos;s jewelry into cash .
in Singapore , about 70 percent of botched items are gold in the city &apos;s 200 deposit houses .
people are saying : &quot; the price of gold looks good , let &apos;s forgo grandmother gold chain and get back next month . &quot;
the largest Thai Pfandbrief operator , easymoney , has experienced a 20 % increase in customer revenue in its branches in recent months .
growth in the Pfandbrief is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only into neighboring Malaysia - where the company operates four homes - but also outside Asia , according to Yeah Lee Ching , managing director of ValueMax .
the company finances that with 60 percent of the $ 66 million Singapore dollar it took this week with the stock market in Singapore .
while some lenders have come to the crossfire because of high interest rates , Yeah explains that Pfandbrief would not only provide cheaper interest rates than other lending , but also not directly raised debt .
&quot; customers are offending items they already own , and the disappearance of personal valuables does not increase household debt , &quot; she explains .
the Pfandbrief business is socially increasingly accepted as short @-@ term , secured financing .
nor are all those who use Pfandbriefe in financial difficulties .
rich people from Singapore also come to the stores of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash .
customers come from every social layer .
&quot; these include wealthy people who borrow something for a business or an investment in the short term , or small businesses that need to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow , &quot; Yeah says .
sometimes they just need money very quickly .
NSA sues data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
the intelligence investigator Edward Snowden has a principled interest in helping Germany to educate the increasingly explosive NSA spying .
following the presentation of Hans @-@ Christian Flubele , the Green Party chairman , at his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia , it was about the conditions under which the ex @-@ intelligence staff would testify to a German public prosecutor or to a committee of inquiry .
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation , Flubele told ARD magazine Panorama .
bailout over $ 325 million Australian dollar for Tasmanian health care
the Australian government is insisting on the tough terms associated with the bailout over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care to ensure the federal government cannot waste the money .
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take &quot; immediate action &quot; to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic illness and system restrictions .
funding for a four @-@ year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie .
&quot; the government has put together an emergency rescue package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the state , &quot; Plibersek said today .
the $ 325 @-@ million package includes $ 31 million in emergency aid for election benefits .
a further 2600 operations , including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for grey star , are intended to eliminate residues .
in addition , there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better follow @-@ up after stationary records , specialist medical education , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .
&quot; these investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinicians said they were the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system , &quot; Tanya Plibersek said .
the minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government .
the state must maintain the current level of funding to get money from the Commonwealth , and report monthly on where the extra money has been spent .
a three @-@ member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as Wilkie explained today , the $ 325 million would only benefit little if &quot; they are not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course . &quot;
however , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May .
&quot; I am confident that federal aid will make a big contribution to taking the state &apos;s public health system off the custody list , &quot; Wilkie said .
according to the federal government , these election benefits will largely offset the recent cuts .
but the opposition &apos;s health spokesman at federal level , Peter Dutton , believes today &apos;s announcement is just a &quot; pavement solution . &quot;
&quot; we are therefore in today &apos;s situation because the Labor government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health care system , &quot; he told ABC TV .
it cannot be the case that a state government spends nearly half a billion dollars out of the system , putting the Commonwealth in 300 million and then pretending to be good news .
Dutton called for Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar of the bailout will be spent on additional bureaucracy .
Guillaume Nicloux &apos;s adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details , but it is also heavier fare than necessary .
the plot , played in the France of the 1760s , tells the attacking story of Suzanne , a young nobleman sent from her family to the monastery .
when rebel , she faces the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic upper , becoming the object of erotic fascination of another .
the film never glides from stardom or sensationalism - and that is its problem .
the solemn earnest with which the film is told also makes it to the audience for the agonizing book shirt .
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , according to a surveillance group
Syria destroyed key facilities to manufacture chemical weapons and grid gas munitions , the global surveillance group for chemical weapons said Thursday , while heavy clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored .
also on Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed soon three years ago since the start of the civil war .
the organization &apos;s announcement of the ban on chemical weapons ( OPCW ) came a day before the date on
1 November , which the organisation Damascus , based in The Hague , had set up to destroy or &quot; inoperable &quot; all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons , including all machinery for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling of ammunition .
the conclusion of this incident , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria &apos;s chemical weapons by mid @-@ 2014 .
the destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
Damascus , however , has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies .
there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin .
the announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday , experts say that there is a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities here , as the United Kingdom @-@ based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported .
the activist group , which tracks the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria , said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died .
of these , 61,067 are civilians , including 6,365 children .
on the government side , 29,954 of them included the army of President Bashar Assad , 18,678 were pro @-@ government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .
also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army data and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .
on July 25 , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .
this number has not yet been updated .
the conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country .
Assad &apos;s forces have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels , many of whom have ties to al @-@ Qaida groups .
the Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not specify details .
the fighting underscores the danger the chemical weapons inspectors face , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time amid a deadly civil war .
according to the OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , the team &quot; is now convinced that it has seen all of Syria &apos;s important production and mixing / filling facilities and witnessed its destruction . &quot;
therefore , no further inspection activities are currently planned . &quot;
earlier this week , inspectors said they had completed the first round of reviews and visited 21 of 23 of Damascus &apos;s sites .
because of security concerns , the visit of two facilities was not possible , the inspectors said .
on Thursday , OPWC said the two sites had been abandoned , according to Syrian statements , &quot; and the existing objects of the chemical weapons program there had been moved to other designated facilities that were inspected . &quot;
it was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities the OPCW inspectors could not visit .
Syria has put forward a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved by the OPWC &apos;s executive committee next month .
&quot; I pull the hat off the bravery and the courage you have all shown when completing the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization , &quot; Ahmed Uzumcu , the director @-@ general of the monitoring organization , said in a commentary published by OPCW .
for the past three years , the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting Assad &apos;s government and its security forces , which include many members of Alawites , a secession of Shiite Islam .
regarding further developments , the head of the observation group , Rami Abdurrahman , said there was a strong explosion at an air defense facility in Syria &apos;s coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday .
the cause of the explosion was not known , he explained .
anger over verdict for Bali bombers
survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 bombings in Bali responded angered by the verdict for the last of the sufferers , who were brought to justice since Umar Patek , in her view , was to be stabbed .
Patek , who was on the run for just under 10 years as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia , was sentenced to 20 years for his role in building explosives for the bomb attack .
with penalties , he could be sacked after 15 years .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in Kuta &apos;s popular tourist district , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .
a guilty plea was also made in a number of terrorist @-@ related charges , including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 .
the prosecutor had called for a life sentence , even if she could have applied for the death penalty for the man who , because of his reputation as a mastermind bomber , is also known as &quot; Demolition Man . &quot;
the decision has aroused painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth who lost her 39 @-@ year @-@ old twin stars Jane and Jenny in the devastation directed by Patek and his fellow novels nearly 10 years ago .
struggling with tears , she said Patek should have been sentenced to death .
I really mean he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .
&quot; you should put him in front of a firing squad , &quot; Corteen told AAP .
I have to live every day that I won &apos;t get any more grandchildren and I &apos;ll never see my daughters .
the Sari Club was likened to the ground when , just after 11pm on October 12 , 2002 , a huge bomb exploded in a small car parked in front of the nightclub .
Peter Hughes was in Paddy &apos;s bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives .
he fell into the coma after the attack a month and &quot; died &quot; three times while hanging on a life @-@ saving system .
Hughes said Patek deserves the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah - Amrozi , Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago .
really , this type should be given the death penalty before everyone else .
letting him alive - no , there &apos;s no reason to let him alive .
getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much .
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber to stand trial .
he escaped nearly a decade of arrest but was eventually picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad , where U.S. forces killed former al @-@ Qaida chief Osama bin Laden just four months later .
during the trial , an FBI agent said intelligence reports provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al @-@ Qaida .
&quot; he didn &apos;t face up , &quot; Corteen said .
until recently , he has shown no remorse at how much suffering he inflicted on other people .
the verdict came ahead of the 10 @-@ year anniversary of the attack this year , which is being held with commemorations in Bali and Australia .
&quot; there will be a lot of tears this year , &quot; Corteen said .
Patek can still appeal against his ruling .
FAA : passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but don &apos;t have mobile phone calls )
air travelers can now hear from departure to landing their electronic devices for reading , working , playing , music and using the reputation of movies , but not by phone , according to the new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the US .
but passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .
how quickly they would be implemented , down from the respective airline , FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a news conference .
the airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight staff as well as the regulations governing the storage of equipment in accordance with the new rules .
the FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft .
among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue .
&quot; depending on the state of the plan , we could approve extended use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; the FAA announced in a statement .
currently , passengers must shut off smartphones , tablets and other devices when the plane doors are closed .
they may not start them again until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .
when entering the landing flight , passengers must relinquish it and must not restart it before the aircraft has landed .
under the new guidelines , airlines whose planes are secured against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at launch , landing and on the rolling field , the FAA said .
most new transport aircraft and other planes adapted for use Wi @-@ Fi at greater heights should meet the criteria .
Laura Glading , president of the Professional Aircraft Association , welcomed the changes .
&quot; if the new arrangement is implemented safely - and we are working closely with the airline on this - both sides will benefit , &quot; commented Glading .
we are frankly sorry to have to feel like passers on this issue .
however , Internet connections for surfing , exchanging e @-@ mails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , the authority explained .
passengers are urged to place smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .
so still no &quot; Words With Friends , &quot; the Scrabble resembles an online game played by actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone , when he had to leave high @-@ profile a jet by American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the airstrip .
and heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be dusted , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .
mobile phone calls during the flight also remain banned .
the regulatory competence for phone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .
FAA suspends possibly banning certain electronic devices at launch and landing
last month Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board , security expert on national transport issues on CBS News , said cell phones would still be considered a risk .
&quot; mobile phones are really a problem , not just because they could potentially cause disruption to navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmissions , &quot; Rosenker added .
an industry advisory committee created by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices .
in recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use .
critics such as Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill from Missouri take the view that there are no valid security reasons for the ban .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of equipment has become ubiquitous .
some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers may forget or ignore the switch @-@ off of the device .
the FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travelers after reports of disruptions of navigation and communication equipment by passenger @-@ led UKW radios that were the latest technology trend at the time .
new aircraft are far more dependent on electric systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not constitute electronic interference .
airlines have been providing Wi @-@ Fi to passengers for several years when the flight level has reached .
the aircraft adapted to Wi @-@ Fi systems are also more vulnerable to interferences .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be eligible for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines , Huerta said .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally give much less radio coverage than previous generations .
e @-@ readers , for example , only give up minimal radiation when you &apos;re umbling .
but when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .
advocates of easing restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers include Amazon.com.
in 2011 , company employees invited a passenger plane full of Kindle e @-@ readers and made a test flight to identify problems but could not find any .
members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment .
Douglas Kidd of the passenger association National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes the disruption from the devices is real , even if the risk is minimal .
other county officials said there were only isolated reports of pilots preaching for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices , and most of them are very old .
the committee , however , recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange the removal of the equipment by passengers when landing in poor visibility .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adjustment for travelers who would now be extensively equipped with technology .
&quot; we are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety , &quot; said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .
released by air rescue service from North Sea drilling island
a bird flown by air service to the coast , which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island , was released back into nature .
the waterfall was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was flown by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA at its rescue center in Alloa .
Colin Seddon , head of the centre , said : &quot; this waterfall was probably a wintry train bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea . &quot;
apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island .
he added : &quot; he could not continue flying , which is why we were contacted with the request for help . &quot;
when released , the water rallies were fit and healthy again .
is Europe &apos;s elite ready to do business with Britain ?
business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in Britain want to change in our relations with the EU .
to this end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 executives from the economy , accounting for about the UK &apos;s corporate sizes , sectors and regions .
the results of the poll will surprise many .
we found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe and focus on countries that modernize and grow while EU countries are stagnating .
they hope that new trade links with countries such as China , India and Brazil will be favored by government , rather than halting the long and exhausting process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .
when asked about their view on certain legally regulated issues - from antitrust to product legislation - the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be recovered to Westminster .
there was general dissatisfaction about the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe &apos;s trading zone - even 40 % of large companies agreed to what is traditionally the most pro @-@ European .
finally , and presumably most , our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and that a relationship with the EU based on trade is not on politics .
this finding , found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a &quot; meaningful change &quot; that will bring the stalemate of action back to Britain .
it &apos;s all about much - a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 percent change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum .
the Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the UK economy is behind its plan for renegotiating UK conditions for EU membership .
it also shows that companies expect a renegotiation of power back to Britain .
a better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary now that the eurozone is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in the UK , as the result of our survey shows , which means greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation .
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria as start of a new gas launch
the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest European energy projects , the Gazprom Board said .
&quot; today &apos;s event is a milestone : construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , &quot; Gazprom &apos;s chief executive , Alexei Miller , said in a statement on Thursday .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .
South Stream is expected to provide more diversity in Russia &apos;s export routes through Europe .
a contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where most of Russia &apos;s gas is stored for Europe , provides for increased risk in conventional routes , as is heard by the official .
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , meant that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were &quot; forever &quot; switched off .
Bulgarian consumers get gas from South Stream at discounted fares when the entire project enters into operation in 2015 .
according to Gazprom , construction work in other subordinated countries is expected to begin on the planned route towards the end of the year .
the pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas .
for national and international investors , no way past the real estate site Germany .
the economic fundamentals are correct , and funding opportunities are excellent .
this has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper .
German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the European comparison of good economic conditions in the country .
this is what Christian Ulbrich , CEO of Europe , Middle East and Africa told Jones Lang LaSalle , on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper .
look at the volume of transactions , according to Ulbrich .
in the first three quarters of this year , it added 31 % compared to the same period last year .
in Britain , the plus was only 6 % , down 19 % in France .

hearing before the Royal Commission : two YMCA employees accused of sexual offences
two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) have been charged with sex offences related to children before charges were filed in 2011 against children &apos;s nurse Jonathan Lord from Caringbah as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children .
but at the opening statement to the commission , the YMCA said it had &quot; never had to deal with an incident of sexual child abuse in the organization . &quot;
managing director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with offences involving child pornography , and another where a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 had been convicted of abuse of him .
Hare told Gail Furness , one of the commission &apos;s assistant attorneys , that he knew of the first case but did not know the second .
he acknowledged that the YMCA &apos;s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that &quot; there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety . &quot;
evidence before the commission shows , rather , that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Department of Education ) in August of the year .
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , acknowledged that the management had failed &quot; from me to downwards &quot; in hiring Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety guidelines .
Lord was convicted earlier this year of sex offences against 12 boys during his two @-@ year operation for the YMCA .
he was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
Hare denied , however , that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Lords violations regarding the safety of children .
the staff said they were watching violations , including that Lord was alone with children , caring them privately as babysitters , leaving them sitting on his lap , to one said he liked it , and children were playing with his cellphone .
Danielle Ockwell , whose precinct was Lord and who had asked for a training session on child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour , said that the children &apos;s services manager Jacqui Barnat , who was in the YMCA Caringbah the superiors Lords , was &quot; very intimidating and most of the time very awkward . &quot;
the managing director said he would not accept statements from staff that they had not dared to reimburse their superiors .
instead , he said , rather , their friendship with Lord affected their judgment , which is why they had not reported it .
Hare said he told the board of YMCA NSW his view was that the lesson the organization had to draw from the Jonathan @-@ Lord incident &quot; did not care about reporting &quot; by staff , and the board agreed to him .
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations were filed was made by the managing director of the YMCA &apos;s children &apos;s services company , Liam Whitley .
he said this should prevent a contamination of the evidence , but that was &quot; overzealous &quot; and poorly implemented .
the YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children in the period when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011 , said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , an expert on sexual child abuse , the commission .
he explained that there were &quot; serious problems &quot; in hiring , checking , processing , training and supervision of employees .
the hearing was adjourned until December 20 .
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister - but conceded that a comeback was unlikely .
in an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , the 59 @-@ year @-@ old announced his views on various domestic issues .
since resigning in June 2007 after a decade as head of state , Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics , and his comments mostly limited foreign policy and his role as the envoy of the Quartet of peacekeepers in the Middle East .
on the question of whether he would like to return to the prime minister &apos;s office , Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words : &quot; yes , sure , but it is unlikely that this will happen , so &quot; ...
when horse @-@ racing experts caught up in droves in Cardiff to cut the horse of the year , they were aware that a fierce competition was imminent .
but none was prepared for the three @-@ year @-@ old Fenton Kirkland .
the knot , who is not even in kindergarten and only made his first moves a few months ago , and his Shetland @-@ Pony Toffee trabbed loosely through the three rounds and took the first prize - leaving 30 adult opponents behind .
the inseparable couple , both equal , were praised for their resignation , behaviour and style at the annual competition , which is being held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .
during his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons , he had set up his plates at a cheeky angle and led the two @-@ year @-@ old Toffee through the ring .
Fenton was touted by jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony , which was well above his age .
and Toffee received brides for his appearance and personality .
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift on his third birthday and has been practicing with the Shetland pony every day since then .
his mother , Donna , 30 , said : &quot; Fenton and Toffee are a great man . &quot;
they had to compete against the entire participant field and have gone off the square with gold pokal and rosette .
it was only the second time he had attended a competition with Toffee and we were all thrilled when he won .
completely strangers in the arena thought him to be so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .
the little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells , who has been leading horses for over 10 years .
Howell told me : &quot; the whole audience was like electrifying and everyone fired him and clapped him . &quot;
he ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny he did fantastic work .
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to care for .
just as he &apos;s started , it won &apos;t take long for him to be on the &quot; Horse of the Year &quot; show - and I &apos;m sure he &apos;ll do well .
a spokesman for the annual horse show said : &quot; Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . &quot;
together they are a great team .
the jurors rated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten and presented in the lead ring .
they pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leaders - and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring .
I &apos;m sure Fenton &apos;s sweet clothes contributed their part , which suited really perfectly to the occasion .
Chinese newspaper to be &apos; reformed &apos; after appeal
a Chinese newspaper that on the front page called for the release of a reporter who had been charged with defamation should be reformed , a press officer said .
the New Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed out a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou .
but Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a part @-@ state company .
now the New Express is undergoing a &quot; comprehensive reclassification , &quot; the regulator said .
the &quot; Retirement Order &quot; was obtained by the Office for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .
preliminary investigation found that the New Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several inaccurate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013 .
&quot; the editorial management of the New Express was disorderly , &quot; the regulator announced in a statement .
she said one decided to &quot; impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and deprive him of his reporter license . &quot;
in addition , &quot; Yangcheng Evening News Group instructed that the New Express be fully reclassified and recommended that the relevant persons be identified at the New Express and immediately check the New Express leadership team . &quot;
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion .
after being arrested , the newspaper released two calls for his release on the front page and put himself behind his journalistic work .
but then Chen appeared on state television and admitted he had published false reports against pay .
&quot; in this case , I hurt Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence , &quot; he explained to the state news channel CCTV .
I did it primarily because I was on money and fame .
it has become clear to me that I have acted wrong .
following Chen &apos;s apology , the New Express issued an apology on the front page and said it failed to properly review the reports .
various well @-@ known suspects have recently filed confessions on television .
experts say confessions are still routinely enforced , despite a law change earlier this year that banned authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves .
drug tunnel discovered by its own railway between the US and Mexico
one of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , complete with lighting , ventilation and electrical rail operations , has now been discovered .
U.S. authorities described the 120 times 90 inches messened tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they &apos;d ever found .
the tunnel , which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of just under six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .
in the area there are countless unseemly warehouses , making it easier to hide drug @-@ laden trucks .
the tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported undetected in it , authorities said .
during the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , according to the court &apos;s records .
three men who worked as drivers , according to authorities , were charged with possession and intended sales of marijuana and cocaine .
they face prison sentences of between 10 years and life for a guilty plea .
in Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of pollution channels .
the tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .
some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October , suggesting the drug cartels face the challenge of how to quickly bring their product to consumers .
in 2010 , authorities found a just 640 feet long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential home in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego .
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love
actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .
in an interview , however , Bloom said he and Kerr still love each other .
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two @-@ year @-@ old Flynn .
actor Orlando Bloom has spoken to the separation from his wife , top model Miranda Kerr .
in an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric , which was supposed to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , &quot; life sometimes doesn &apos;t run exactly as we plan or hope . &quot;
Kerr and he himself still loved each other , stressed the 36 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; we will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn . &quot;
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 their sons Flynn was born .
according to Lexika , vegetarianism is subordinate to vegetarianism , but it is very different from that .
because while vegetarians are allowed to eat cream , ice or a strong oak , these trawls are not on the coffee table .
milk , cheese , egg , besides the abandonment of meat and fish , leaves the vegan out of all animal products - honey is also denied .
what remains to be asked , but the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity .
&quot; breadsticks are very popular , &quot; explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , who is touring a variety of special products for vegans .
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store in Domgasse .
for 13 years , the native New Zealander vegan lives , in Lampertheim he ( almost ) finds everything he needs to live on . &quot; in 1997 I introduced my diet and became vegetarians . &quot;
the next step was the turn of the century and I became Veganer .
&quot; the conviction came not just because of the diet but because of the shoe choice , &quot; says Proctor , who prefers art leather .
he acknowledged that it is also in other everyday concerns without animal products .
first and foremost , vegan is his one ethics .
&quot; I don &apos;t want animals to have to die for me , &quot; Proctor argues the maxim of the vegans , which extends to all consumer behavior .
instead of mourning burgers , scraps or rubber bears , the vegan quickly discovered completely new products , and enthusiasm rose .
&quot; it &apos;s a double bonus , &quot; Proctor says today , &quot; in fact , vegan does not represent a waiver , not an assailant , but it is an enrichment . &quot; the assumption that using the food conversion reduces the choice of menu options leads Proctor more to the power of habit .
and those very conditionality also allowed some to fail .
&quot; the addictive factor is a very crucial factor that many quickly abandon , much like smoking , &quot; Proctor notes a comparison .
and applies : &quot; certain tastes are not fixed on the animal . &quot;
often it is the spices or the kind of preparation that make up the taste .
&quot; but you can also create the same effect in other ways , &quot; explains the Veganer .
for example , Proctor brings aubergines , champignons and also a few vegans .
it pays attention to a balanced , varied diet where it is supposed to taste badly .
of course you want to have something between the teeth , which is legitimate .
&quot; it &apos;s supposed to taste , but that &apos;s not just to reduce animal food , &quot; Proctor added .
he did not suffer health damage until eating disorders , another widespread assumption .
for me , the changeover had a positive aspect .
I do not take a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content .
there are high @-@ performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , I often check out , &quot; Proctor reveals .
especially against the lack of vitamin B12 , many vegan critics warn .
&quot; as animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on the pasture , it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the coolant , the vitamin B12 proportion is high , &quot; Proctor finds .
for vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzym in the form of tablets .
&quot; my B12 values are OK , &quot; he explains .
far away , Proctor must not go for food procurement .
basic foods finally exist everywhere and every supermarket now has soybean and other products .
I find everything I need on the ground .
only from and on I buy something special .
&quot; a lot of people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but that is how it behaves with &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products . &quot;
in any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than is generally assumed .
&quot; in the home kitchen there is a lot to discover , with a few little knees you can get good , if not partially better results , &quot; says Proctor .
Margarine rather than butter , slightly more baking powder and cabbage acid instead of egg , with his vegan cheese pie , Proctor could also get his son @-@ in @-@ law to marvel .
family firm gives the Veganer a new season .
this has momentum when you cook together , it has a new place .
&quot; the situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , &quot; says Proctor .
of course he has already been sceptical .
don &apos;t taste my meal any more ?
&quot; should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? &quot; - if you have any questions , you have to act as a vehicle with a fingertips .
&quot; I &apos;m not opposed to people , I &apos;m part of this society , &quot; Proctor doesn &apos;t want an enclave term .
and , more precisely , the everyday world does not seem as vegan @-@ like as suspected - and the vegan does not seem as constrained in everyday life as usual .
fast food is also allowed .
fries are everywhere !
&quot; many Dönerläden offer Falafel , or just a vegetarian yufka , &quot; says Proctor .
in a pizzeria , he wears out on pasta dishes , or just orders a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .
the restaurants are so slow to do so .
&quot; when I started feeding me vegan 13 years ago , everything was much more difficult , &quot; the New Zealander can trace a development : &quot; you have to talk to the people , make them aware of it . &quot;
&quot; if enough queries come , they may be inclined to supplement the menu , &quot; he hopes .
vegane restaurants are developing , such as the cookery in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfree .
Proctor hears the wish that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the menu .
basically , vegan dishes are there for everyone .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , in the true sense of the word , because they exclude others , &quot; Proctor notes .
&quot; if you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the most of it impossible from the outset , &quot; says Proctor .
the purchase of vegan products could be a little difficult at the beginning .
in particular , if you learn to understand that animal additives can also be included in earthen animal additives , you seem to be leaving the courage to follow ethics at so many hurdles and traps .
not only did Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen write a book : &quot; Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that are added to food but also cleaning products .
&quot; gradually you develop a Scannerview and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to , &quot; It &apos;s sometimes better to take small steps than to stand up or stumble , &quot; Proctor knows .
veganism , he is an important moral finger pointing at consciousness .
perhaps he does not quite manage to take away his habits , but at least he can teach the consumer to question his habits critically .
the stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to keep its customers in breath .
trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon of German time .
in a communication , the operator was responsible for technical problems .
the other 11 US options markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .
the latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger panels at the exchange operator .
only on Tuesday , the Nasdaq &apos;s indexes were not calculated for an hour because of errors in data transport .
in August this year , there had been two panes in one week alone .
first , US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent mass defective purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems .
as a result , the exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and remove the orders .
two days after that , half of the total stock market in the US came to a halt because of a computer panic on the Nasdaq exchange for several hours .
also , last year &apos;s IPO of Facebook provided a stir .
the Nasdaq systems were not up to the tide of purchase and sales orders , but later established the SEC &apos;s stock market watchdog and scrambled the company to a record $ 10 million fine .

British police make Assange an extradition conviction
British police today handed over an extradition warrant to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum .
Scotland Yard explained that the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Australian had been given a &quot; call to face up &quot; calling him to appear at a police station , and added that if he did not comply , he was threatening arrest .
Assange faces extradition to Sweden for charges in a sexual offence after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month .
as he feared Stockholm would extradite him to the US , he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19 , asking the South American country for political asylum .
Scotland Yard has sent &quot; a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man a call to stand trial at a time chosen by us at a police station , &quot; a spokesman said .
he continues to violate the terms of his release on bail .
the message did not comment on the delivery of the police call .
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible espionage charges after posting more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the investigative website WikiLeaks .
driver charged with 210 mph and hot drink between legs gets £ 1,000 fine
a motorist has been fined £ 1,000 for driving with up to 210 mph and a hot drink between his legs .
Andrew Howie , 35 , from Tiptree , Essex , was stopped with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27 .
after the police stopped him , they discovered the beverage bag between his legs .
at Colchester District Court , Howie pleaded guilty without the necessary care and attention .
he received seven points and a six @-@ month driving ban .
Howie was also convicted of paying a cost of £ 90 as well as a victim subsidy of £ 100 .
tax on foreign property owners against London &apos;s speculative bubble
the Treasury has provisionally canceled the CGT measure , but is still awaiting the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne , who had imposed a stamp duty of 7 % on housing in the 2012 budget , costing over £ 2 million as well as annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company rather than as individuals .
already , revenue from stamp duty for housing in Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea , which were £ 708 million in tax year 2012 / 13 , outpaced revenues for Northern Ireland , Wales , the Northeast , Northwest , Yorkshire and the Humber region .
Cook said : &quot; after the increases in stamp duty on high @-@ priced housing and the introduction of related legislation against a move , it is difficult to claim that high @-@ quality properties are taxed too low , regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system . &quot;
&quot; but this move could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying real estate in London , or discouraging owners from selling it , &quot; he added .
first @-@ class properties - the top five to 10 per cent of the housing market after price - in the affluent London southwest belt , which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon , have grown by the record 11.8 per cent last year .
prices in central London showed simultaneous annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging &quot; domestic market &quot; in which the southwestern part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , according to an investigation by Savills .
scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which the tail of a dog stands with its mood .
previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail waved more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while it was left with nervous dogs .
but now scientists say other dogs perceive these subtle differences and can respond to them .
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trient , said : &quot; in humans it is well known that the left and right brains react differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions . &quot;
here we tried to look at this with other species .
he also noted that dogs , like humans , have the right brains for the movement of the left , and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .
to learn more about how dogs respond to the lateral tail of their counterparts , the researchers monitored the animals while these films of other dogs were beheaded .
they measured the heart rate of the foursomes and analyzed the behavior .
probably we &apos;ll soon understand why the tail moves in one direction , sometimes in the other
Professor Vallortigara said : &quot; we showed the dogs films with dogs - either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right . &quot;
when the animals saw how an otherwise printable dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the waving dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .
but was the tail tendency mainly to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog who waved ) , so their heart rate rose and they looked unsettled .
according to Professor Vallortigara , the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .
on the contrary , he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience on which movements they should worry and when not .
he said : &quot; if you have different encounters with other dogs and the Wedding is associated with the tail in one direction more with friendly behavior and the right side produces more of a less friendly behavior , then you respond on the basis of these experiences . &quot;
researchers say the findings could help dog owners , vets and trainers understand their animal &apos;s emotions better .
John Bradshaw , an expert on dog behaviour and guest pencil at the Faculty of Animal Care at the University of Bristol , said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right was important for dogs .
last year , a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they watch an aggressive dog , and to the right when it &apos;s a satisfied dog .
in another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following said : &quot; dogs are more likely to go on a robotic dog when his , tail &quot; left waved and not right , rather than become unsettled - exactly different than in the Italian study . &quot;
according to his statement , the differences could therefore stir that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs .
a study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help , he explained .
&quot; while there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined - and dogs are no exception , &quot; Bradshaw added .
since their behaviour is easy to record , it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow because of the disease Alex Turners

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will first convene new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22 , as the Vatican announced Thursday .
Cardinals are the most senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also who choose a pope , so Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .
there are currently 201 cardinals .
however , a cardinal who has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election - that falls to a group of 120 &quot; eligible cardinals . &quot;
in a statement announcing the news , Father Federico Lombardi , a spokesman for the Vatican , said there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony is held to appoint the new cardinals , which is also known as Consistorium .
&quot; Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene the Consensus in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned , &quot; Lombardi said .
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of eligible cardinals will likely have fallen by February .
he explained that a pope normally recounts as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals again looks at 120 , and as many cardinals over 80 as he would like .
the consistency next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year , according to Valero .
there is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and , in particular , Italy .
&quot; it will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance , &quot; he said .
forty percent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
the Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the council of cardinals founded by Francis , a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the church .
in the past , the pope decided everything alone .
&quot; now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , &quot; Valero said .
he explained that it was &quot; well possible &quot; that Francis would ask the Cardinals for advice .
but so far we have not been in this position - all this is completely new .
Valero said that typically the bishops would be called to cardinals from large places , but stole Francis &quot; full of surprises - so we don &apos;t know who he is appointing . &quot;
GM calls for new pickup truck in the US to repair seating
general Motors is calling for nearly 19,000 of its brand @-@ new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra @-@ Pickup Trucks with construction year 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat residue , according to a statement from the U.S. regulator for vehicle safety on Friday .
for some of the cars , there can be a defect in the mechanism for setting back the front seat residue .
for this reason , they do not comply with the federal guidelines on vehicle safety at head bases .
&quot; if you drive from behind on the vehicle , it is possible that head support does not properly protect inmates , so there is an increased risk of injury , &quot; was read in the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration &apos;s website ( NHTSA ) .
the recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September .
delivery of the GM Trucks began in June and represents the main model launch of the leading U.S. automaker since the 2009 insolvent restructuring .
GM informed vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect .
NHTSA could not check the notification letter because of the 16 @-@ day government shutdown , which had a negative impact on car sales in October .
the sale of the Silverado and Sierra Trucks , which were redeveloped for the 2014 model year , has risen 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year , GM said Friday .
in October , GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra Pickup Trucks .
GM shares rose 1.4 per cent to $ 37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon .
despair of an Obama voter
I chose President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
he says Obama has made commendable efforts , which have been thwarted by the House Republican &apos;s blockade agenda
the blockade policy does not apologize to Obamacare &apos;s website problems , the drone strikes
Obama &apos;s memoir about the 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what might have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at Harvard Medical School .
I &apos;m currently reading a terribly sad book .
it &apos;s a book I believed it would heal me during the gloomy second year of my medical degree and give me hope again .
it is called &quot; The Audacity to Win &quot; ( courage to win ) and describes Barack Obama &apos;s memoir on the 2008 presidential election .
when I &apos;m finished with my patient &apos;s records and going to bed in the evening , the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and smoked my breath .
the election became a landslide victory and news spokesman held to highlight the historical significance of that hour .
my classmates wept before joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find .
a young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .
when Obama moved to office in 2008 , he had approval ratings of 82 % .
and then I close the book .
turning back on the present is a bad awakening as if you are being taken out of a dream .
it &apos;s hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague reminder , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .
in the years since I first cast my vote , something has actually changed .
but it &apos;s just nothing I could have imagined .
I recognise the great and versatile things Obama has achieved , from passing the Affordable Care Act on health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of forced secrecy in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .
I , too , believe that the partisan block debate has overturned too many aspirations with which our nation should move forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and closing Guantanamo Bay , to name just a few .
but having defended the Obama administration many times against colleagues and acquaintances , I came to the end with my explanations .
I have reached a point of political despair .
Republican blockade politics cannot explain why to allow foreign leaders to intercept or kill innocent children by drones overseas .
it cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished , which disclose government wrongdoing .
it cannot explain why Anwar al @-@ Awlaki , a US citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why public funding and exit limits will be circumvented during the presidential elections .
it does not justify the results of a report that says the White House &apos;s efforts to ruin the media are the &quot; most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . &quot;
and most recently , it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s what I should have expected .
whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns .
obviously , the Members &apos; Office is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate .
but when I look at the above examples , they seem largely elected by the government itself .
and that bothers me most .
I chose Obama again in 2012 , not because I was thrilled about his candidacy .
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unexplained alternative , saying he didn &apos;t seem to set his direction and positions .
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free of pressure from future elections , would meet the hope of which we had heard for so long .
but with the sinking of approval ratings for Obama to below 45 % this week , returning to 2008 through this book has become all the tougher .
it awakens in me the yearning for the many promises that have broken up in air .
this week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to plug a serious loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania .
in a meeting with election supporters after the decision , he told his staff they had to get back on course and follow the purpose of their cause .
&quot; I want us to rediscover our spell , &quot; he said .
we have to remember who we are .
it &apos;s five years later , Mr. President , and I couldn &apos;t agree more to you .
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris .
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflicts of interest on parental leave
the billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters would become pregnant and could therefore benefit .
the mining magnate , who is in a court battle over paying $ 6 million in carbon tax , raised the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table about whether he was in conflict .
the Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether to remove or cut the CO2 and mining taxes .
but Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott &apos;s daughters would personally benefit from the laws .
&quot; he is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether she receives holidays or not , &quot; Palmer said .
two months after the election , the election commission declared Palmer with 53 votes ahead after the recount officially became the winner of Fairfax &apos;s Sunshine Coast seat .
Palmer called for an overhaul of the process of counting votes so that it can proceed more quickly .
Tony Abbott &apos;s daughters Frances and Bridget .
should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote ?
&quot; we need a better system , &quot; he said .
why should we not have a system where you enter , enter the data into a computer , select it immediately and then have the result at 6 : 30 p.m. in the evening ?
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils when marking the ballot .
are they used because you can then wipe out the results if you don &apos;t like one ?
voting with pencils today is incredible .
the Electoral Commission has looked at options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .
Palmer , 59 , explained that among his policies is an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office &quot; very seriously . &quot;
a public office is about the service to the public .
&quot; we are not seeking any reward except for history , namely that we can serve at a critical time of this community , &quot; he said .
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
the Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division , according to two people familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the global government investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly taking off .
some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank and RBS , confirmed they were working with authorities on the investigation into the world &apos;s largest financial market , on which 5.3 trillions of dollars a day change the owner .
the two dealers would be the first RBS staff to be suspended in the expanding investigation , which follows the scandal surrounding Libor interbank business .
the bank , which did not comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities .
&quot; our investigation into this issue continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators , &quot; the bank said two weeks ago .
last month , the situation surrounding people indicated that RBS had forwarded the records of e @-@ mails and instant messages sent by and to a former retailer to the UK regulator , the Financial Conduct Authority .
this trader , Richard Usher , had left RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been judged by his current position as European head of Forex spot trading at JPMorgan .
Rohan Ramchandani , head of European spot trading at Citi , was judged this week and Matt Gardiner , formerly senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS , was suspended at Standard Chartered this week .
none of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing .
asked about Usher &apos;s instant message group , bankers at Barclays and Citigroup said the situation was approaching people .
UBS announced this week that it was taking steps against some of its employees after Swiss regulator FINMA said it was looking into alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks .
at least six authorities worldwide - the European Commission , FINMA , the Swiss competition authority WeKo , the FCA , the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are currently dealing with allegations that bankers should have agreed to deal with transactions in the currency market .
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .
banks muddled Instant Messages and e @-@ mails from several years in search of cases of wrongdoing .
news about these investigations has put traders in turmoil in an area that has in recent years been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks , but has been under pressure this year because low volatility in currencies is limiting opportunities for speculators .
some bankers have tried to downplay the affair , saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .
a leading retailer noted that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of domestic platforms by banks leads to &quot; already having very low ticket prices . &quot;
the news came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced it had terminated a retailer of its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of just under $ 6 million at the end of last year .
the bank promptly informed the competent authorities and worked with them .
&quot; we are sure the retailer acted alone and that the matter is contained , &quot; Credit Suisse explained .
painted the building fence on the belly plot
a group of citizens &apos; initiative &quot; Swiss Wiese &quot; has embellished the building fence on the belly plot on the spa promenade in Bad Men &apos;s alb .
she also neatly and widened the footpath , according to a press release .
the planned cover of the crumbling house in the rear part of the land had not been allowed for security reasons , because the site is threatening to depart .
Alfred Abel , who currently manages the plot , had disagreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI .
prior to the BI &apos;s action , a banner with the message &quot; We have been attached to it . &quot;
however , that did little to disturb the roughly 20 members of the Citizens &apos; Initiative in their action .
her motto on the big poster was &quot; We &apos;re against Bauruinen . &quot;
in doing so , she wanted to point to the risk of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project fail one day .
in conversation with many passers @-@ by before the &quot; construction site , &quot; it became clear that some citizens believe it will be better to implement the city &apos;s project , although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI .
but they are starting to resign because the city continues to delay those responses , the BI says .
as has been heard , the mayor &apos;s public statements also work .
may said at the local council meeting that he feared the departure for the thermal bath , the population should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the referendum .
some people therefore appear to be extremely frightened , while others perceive them as &quot; plumps of blackmail &quot; on the population , according to the BI press release .
the BI thanked donors for the paint and all helpers .
Rangnick bowls for umbrellas : mane not a swallow
as pleased as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg , the sports director of the &quot; bulls &quot; has been disappointed by the referees .
&quot; there is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the Schwalbenroyal category , &quot; he took the two offensive players into protection at a news conference in Salzburg on Thursday .
the most recent occasion for Rangnick &apos;s criticism was yellow for Mane at 3 @-@ 0 against Grödig last Sunday , where the Senegalese became an alleged acting director for publishing - but none , as the TV pictures showed .
&quot; a stark mistake , &quot; Rangnick , who described Harkam &apos;s referee as &quot; completely overwhelmed . &quot;
Harkam would also have contributed &quot; his part &quot; to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Gardena coach Adi Hütter after the match .
he defied his German compatriot : &quot; I would have behaved the same way in every single situation as Roger Schmidt . &quot;
Schmidt himself doesn &apos;t want to have any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter .
I didn &apos;t know why .
&quot; because I &apos;m the one who was offended , &quot; stressed the 46 @-@ year @-@ old .
in view of the success course , however , Rangnick agreed to a Lobeshymn .
&quot; there are only two words for that : really good , &quot; he countered .
there is not much to suspend .
especially the way the team plays is impressive .
that should continue calmly .
cadmium changes in the winter transfer period will hardly happen .
there are no great reasons to change anything .
&quot; except one player occurs with the desire that he wants to leave the club , &quot; Rangnick made clear .
Supreme Court confirms Obama &apos;s health law
it &apos;s a big victory for the Obama administration : the U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the health @-@ care law closely linked to Barack Obama is unconstitutional .
with five to four votes , the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - forcing U.S. citizens to complete health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 - is unconstitutional under the state &apos;s tax authority .
top Justice John Roberts hit the side of the four more liberal members of the chamber , while judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy decided against it .
the Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the law and also considered that the provision of the health law requiring states to either extend the conditions for access to Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid subsidies is not unconstitutional .
the appeal against the law was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .
the law was strongly opposed by all leading Republican presidential candidates , including eventual challenger Mitt Romney , in the pre @-@ election campaign in 2012 .
Norway : Norwegian place turns up with giant mirror light
with huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian oil shed light into their grim valley .
the Rjukan , located in the Vestfjord Valley , usually drops in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .
with three gigantic reflectors in 45 metres , a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime dream came true on Wednesday .
&quot; finally ! &quot; shook Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony at TV 2 .
some of the people of the valley were right back , while others set up safe sunglasses .
so far , Sunday night had to drive with a cable car to a nearby peak .
ten years ago , local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to steer the rays into the valley with mirrors .
however , this Grundidee has been in place since 1913 .
after several years of debate , the council finally adopted the 5 million kronor ( some 615,000 euros ) project .
a similar construction has been providing winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine resort Viganella for several years .
post barely leaps Sunday
&quot; many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for Sunday leaking are still at various mailboxes in the heartland and the city parts , but reading the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG , it is quickly found that the levitation on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place , &quot; FDP shares .
a request from the FDP confirmed this .
on Sundays and holidays , only before the post building in Ernst @-@ Ludwig @-@ Straße 36 and Jakob Müller @-@ Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied .
whether or not to be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in the response to the FDP &apos;s request .
the FDP &apos;s social and youth affairs spokesman , Fritz Röhrenbeck , will be here .
Sunday &apos;s lease is an important postal service right at the time of appointment .
&quot; this thrives radically and unreasonable despite the price increase for letters on January 2013 . &quot;
Thomas Bittner , Liberal Group and City Committee chairman , supports his group &apos;s work : &quot; what annoys me is the fact that here the laying times are being changed or even deleted . &quot;
the post office is miles away from the city centre .
&quot; at least the mailboxes in the city parts must be emptied again and Rosengarten emptied on Sundays , &quot; says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono .
it is also true for the core city , especially non @-@ mobile citizens , that a mailbox with Sunday leaking should also be able to reach the foot .
Röhrenbeck asked in the City Parliament whether the City Council was planning talks with the Post on this matter .
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim .
in his knowledge , however , there is also a Sunday leak in Hofheim .
your party has advocated privatisation .
&quot; then decisions are made elsewhere , &quot; Maier said .
Frankfurt parking charges to rise sharply
parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive .
the city &apos;s Magistrate is advising this morning on a presentation by Transport Secretary Stefan Majer ( Green ) .
therefore , parking charges should be increased by 50 % .
however , this is not to increase prices , but to reduce the time interval of parking clocks and parking slots from 30 to 20 minutes .
in December , the City Council will have to decide .
the trade committee of IHK Frankfurt considers this &quot; not a good idea . &quot;
parking facilities right before the business are &quot; an unundervalued advantage for smaller retailers . &quot;
the transport club Germany believes that an increase after two decades is &quot; quite appropriate and actually long overdue . &quot;
public transport will also be more expensive .
Freudenstadt : quick actions rushed host
with a narrow cadre , men I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to enter the Schiller School Square in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb .
the elders stood with an experienced team on the other net side .
it soon became apparent , however , that they could not quite compete with the rapid actions of Freudenstadt .
with the hard and burst up , the Gönninger did extremely hard .
they repeatedly missed the passes and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz put on the net midway , and were not present at the block defenses .
two high first @-@ rate gains clearly suppressed the superiority of Freudenstadt in all respects .
given this crushing and playoff performance , the third set was then slightly lashed and lustless to the 3 @-@ 0 final ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
there will be a much more powerful opponent on the field on November 2 with the TV Baiersbronn , which was able to prevail clearly in Nagold .
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pälchen , Stefan Räller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .
in the B class , the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt stood in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .
they delivered a hard @-@ fought two @-@ hour match .
nervousness on both sides caused errors and points in particular when ballooning ; even with the passes , precision was sometimes scarce and in some critical game scenes , the overzeal prevented the eye for possible score gains .
in this highly balanced encounter in Marcus Blasutto &apos;s TSV team , however , the great physical dedication and a pleasing commitment of both teams was achieved .
nursing day at the small England hut
for the fifth day of care in the succession of the Natura 2000 project Upper Hotzenwald , a group of dedicated participants met at the small England hut in Ibach .
due to suggestions from the population , this day should be cut off in the area of the hut of view into the valley , Mayor Helmut Kaiser said .
many hikers , according to Kaiser , described this area as the gloss of the gorge where the landscape offers the ideal setting for wonderful views .
he thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that nursing day was an appropriate tool to strengthen the connection between man and nature .
it offers every citizen the opportunity to make a difference in nature .
at the same time , environmental considerations can also be taken into account with the tourist aspect .
this environmental aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Protection of the Government &apos;s Bureau of Freiburg following the welcome by Councilman Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success .
according to Tribukait , the tourist destination of the far @-@ flung region is in line with the aim of maintaining the old all @-@ terrain , which is now highly enriched , with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the remaining pastures .
certain species such as rare butterflies and grashoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of woodland .
they need these free connections for arteries .
Tribukait said she didn &apos;t want to miss it at this point to break a lance for the planned biosphere area .
the current measure is not just seamless in this planning .
a biosphere area also offers an opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the achievements of the life project as well as previous care days .
after these various speeches , Reach Leader Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the helpers into groups .
the larger trees had already been beaten in the run @-@ up , and the forestry trapper was ready for use .
a group of helpers should take care of the exemption of wax bushes and the maintenance of a dry lift .
the goal was the free view at the vantage point .
lads : chefs still only candidate
information on the Internet : although the Baartown Lopeningen , with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a forward @-@ looking school , children &apos;s , youth and senior citizens &apos; policy , as well as its own urban areas , has not yet been reported as an attractive city .
as the only candidate for the succession of the mayor , Norbert Brugger , who is no longer a candidate for retirement , the 46 @-@ year @-@ old banker and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Lopeningen has been established .
the application period expires Monday , November 11 , at 6pm .
Google , Samsung , Huawei sued for Nortel patents
the group , which owns thousands of former Nortel patents , on Thursday filed an avalanche of lawsuits for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that was overbid by Nortel in the bankruptcy auction .
Rockstar , the consortium that had bought the Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei and four other companies for patent violations before the U.S. District Court in Texas .
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement .
the patents apply to technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , according to the lawsuit , which affects the core of Google &apos;s search engine business .
representatives from Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable .
Samsung , Huawei and HTC are making mobile phones that work with Google &apos;s Android operating system , which is in sharp competition with Apple &apos;s and Microsoft &apos;s mobile products .
in 2011 , Google announced an initial bid for $ 900 million for Nortel patents .
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .
after being handed over to Rockstar &apos;s Nortel patents , Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $ 12.5 billion , a deal that was also partly motivated by Motorola &apos;s library to patents .
&quot; although Google has failed with its attempt to acquire the plea at auction , Google has violated the patents and continues to do so , &quot; the plea said .
Rockstar is demanding high compensation from Google as it claims Google &apos;s patent infringement is deliberate , according to the allegation .
Egypt sworn in first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi sets the oath of office , but his day of triumph is not likely to mark the end of political disputes in Egypt .
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a &quot; new Egypt &quot; when he was sworn in as the country &apos;s first freely elected president and thus joined the succession of Husni Mubarak , who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier .
with his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt &apos;s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago .
he placed the oath in front of the 18 black robes of the court , which has its seat on the Nile and has been recreated by an ancient Egyptian temple .
&quot; we are striving for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , &quot; Morsi said at the formal ceremony , which was broadcast live on state television .
&quot; today , the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom , genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said 60 @-@ year @-@ old Morsi , an engineer trained in the US and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that had been targeted mostly as a banned organization by the government since its inception 84 years ago .
hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time .
only a few hundred supporters had gathered in the court to cheer up the new president , and unlike the presidential Prunk from the Mubarak era , traffic was stopped short of time so that the car convoy could cross the usually bustling road linking the city centre with the southern suburbs .
as the Brotherhood &apos;s uncharismatic &quot; spare wheel , &quot; his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate for Islamists , but all those who wanted to target the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak .
&quot; Egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , &quot; declared Morsi , dressed in a blue suit with red tie , to the judges in the wood @-@ fired chamber in which he dismissed the oath of office .
later , Morsi drove to the University of Cairo , where he was supposed to deliver his inaugural address .
he was officially greeted by an army commander who played the national anthem he listened to in hailing .
the military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present .
on his arrival , he was greeted by hundreds of attendees in the university &apos;s largest auditorium with speakers of &quot; The Army and the people are a hand . &quot;
the University of Cairo , established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s .
Morsi placed a symbolic oath in Tahir Square on Friday , the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak &apos;s authoritarian rule last year , and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had assumed from office .
but with the removal of the official oath to the court , and not as usual before parliament , he boils down to the will of the military , indicating that the power struggle will continue .
Morsi &apos;s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures .
Falkenberger nightclub makes for two great evenings
the new season at the Falkenberg nightclub &quot; Blue Velvet &quot; has begun .
on Friday night it is called &quot; Pump this party , &quot; on Saturday night it continues with an Ü 25 party .
fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organisers on both days .
worker crashed by ladder : seriously injured
a 51 @-@ year @-@ old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder on Thursday when a faulty outside sensation broke out .
the man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to switch off a faulty heating sensation at the outside facade of an inn .
as he rose to the ladder attached to the roof rings , this gone and the man crashed onto the concrete floor .
he suffered serious injuries and was taken to Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter &quot; Christophorus 6 . &quot;
rapist in South Africa : twice life in prison
nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17 @-@ year @-@ old girl in South Africa , the perpetrator was sentenced to twice life on Friday .
this was reported by broadcaster SABC .
the victim was later killed in the aftermath of the serious injuries .
Johannes Kana was found guilty earlier in the week of the crime .
the fact had triggered horror nationwide .
the then 21 @-@ year @-@ old raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town .
for 14 hours , doctors struggled to survive the victim , but in vain .
the sight of the youngsters was so appalling that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance .
Kana admitted during the trial to being in the scene with booysen in a bar .
he also confessed to being beaten and raped , but denied he was responsible for the girl &apos;s death .
police had initially run out of several offenders but dropped two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was insufficient .
the prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack .
rape is already almost a daily occurrence in South Africa : there are about 64,000 advertisements annually for sexual violence .
this is almost ten times as much in Germany , but with 82 million people far more inhabitants than South Africa ( 50 million ) .
police and women &apos;s associations in South Africa , however , estimate the darkness in sexual violence is 10 @-@ 25 times .
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the &quot; best ham in the world &quot; : for the TV show &quot; Galileo , &quot; the Pro7 star Bonndorf visited .
the speaker makes it clear at the beginning : the most important thing for the ham is the pig coats , the turbomast is not a good condition .
can ham that you get in every supermarket be a quality product ?
Uli as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest , Jumbo explains the operation of the company &quot; Adler &quot; in Bonndorf .
&quot; Germany &apos;s lovable ham , &quot; as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham .
only with hair protection and Kittel he comes to the inside of the factory .
Jumbo also has to disinfect hands before he is allowed to go to micro .
Jumbo to strengthen at Schnellimbiss in Waldshut spotted
&quot; this is where I &apos;m working smell quantities , &quot; surprise the television makers , black @-@ and @-@ white ham as a mass product .
16,000 culls a week speak for themselves .
weight , fat percentage , color : Uli explains what matters in quality .
most pigs are slaughtered with six months .
television with level ?
details such as the Ph value of the flesh also matter .
the darker the meat , the higher the ph value .
&quot; there I &apos;m looking forward to seeing her Roberto Blanco messt what happens then , &quot; Jumbo cynically said .
here the level of private TV is presented in Reinculture .
but watching is worth watching anyway .
the viewer sees that the crush of the culls continues to be craft .
for : black @-@ and @-@ white ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf .
the secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt .
smoke tower and smoke blast remind Jumbo optically of a &quot; submarine . &quot;
the trick : Tannenzweige here in the smoke ensure the special taste of the Black Forest ham .
20 days in the smoke finally make the ham almost black .
&quot; now the disc disappears in the jumbo , &quot; he announces the test feed .
&quot; the is really delicious , &quot; according to the conclusion of the TV star .
this will enable everyone to live .
you thought travel agencies were part of the past thanks to Internet ?
flight Centre appears to be resisting the trend .
the company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK .
the travel company now expects adjusted annual profit before taxes between $ 325 and $ 340 million , compared with $ 305 to $ 315 million in its previous forecast .
if current targets are reached , that means growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record gain of $ 290.4 million in 2011 / 12 .
as managing director Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre posted eight per cent profit in the first half of the year and reported a strong start to the second half of the year , particularly in Australian and British private business .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , our 10 countries have been profitable and some of them are well on track towards record @-@ breaking revenues before interest and taxes , &quot; he explained .
this includes Australia and the UK , which are typically among our strongest results .
in Australia , the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year , making it a slightly weaker market for business travel .
similarly , it ran for Flight Centre &apos;s leisure business in the UK , while here too business customers were less spending .
the US business was recovering from the seasonally weaker first half of the year , so a profit is expected for the third consecutive year .
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $ 38.20 yesterday .
schools are being urged to focus more on math , spelling and grammar
in courses to English literature , students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare , a 19th @-@ century novel , romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 .
the exam also contains &quot; unseen texts &quot; to encourage broader reading .
the combined course of English literature and language is abolished .
from 2015 , students will have to take a stand @-@ alone GCSE test for language , with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification .
the Department of Education will release the new curriculum for English and mathematics tomorrow - the first subjects radically reshaped .
other core subjects will be changed next year .
in a separate initiative , Ofqual , the supervisory authority for examinations , will announce a reorganization of GCSE structures , including a new designation system and less course work .
in a speech in the summer , Education Secretary Michael Gove said there is a &quot; broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , &quot; noting that the GCSEs would become &quot; more challenging , ambitious and rigorous . &quot;
studies show that less time is spent on math in English schools - 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year - than in most other countries .
by contrast , Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours .
while there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable , coalition travel means that the comprehensive Matheprüstung - combined with a greater weight of expertise in rankings - will probably encourage schools to spend more hours .
the curriculum places more emphasis on &quot; problems from real life , &quot; including financial mathematics .
lovely animals and delicious gowns lure
the most beautiful rabbits of various races and colours are presented by this weekend &apos;s roundabout performance show at the middle house .
the reviews were made as early as Thursday
once again the local association W514 is hosting this large exhibition .
breeders of clubs in Soest County show their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobbyists their rabbits .

SALEM : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
at the next Ecumenical Conference Forum on Monday , 21 October , at the New Museum of the Castle , we are dealing with the subject of &quot; To hell with hell - theological considerations on today &apos;s handling of the last things . &quot;
speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner .
the Ecumenical Conference Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical communities of Salem , the Salem Castle and the Constance Lakes Circle .
Johanna Rahner wants to follow up in the forum on how today people classify the &quot; last things &quot; after death .
if the people of the past centuries had known too much about this , relying on those images of heaven and hell , &quot; which still characterise our notions , &quot; contemporary prophetic teachings are characterized by the hopes of accomplishment more by a certain embarrassment or even a lack of language .
&quot; the greater hope has been heralded by the religious critique , &quot; says the department .
she &quot; provided us with so many questions that the exclamation marks seem to have come to us . &quot;
Johanna Rahner continues to say : &quot; but the crucial challenge remains the nuisance of death . &quot;
it is related to the question of the desire to yearn , &quot; which dreams of everything being good in the end . &quot;
Johanna Rahner , born in Baden @-@ Baden in 1962 , studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .
she graduated in 1997 from Dr. theol . , also in Freiburg .
the Habilitation for Fundamentaltheology and Ecumenical Theology followed at Westphalian Wilhelms University in 2003 .
since 2010 Johanna Rahner has held a lecturer in Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel .
Geislingen : more than 100 young Catholics from Little Heuberg reaffirm their faith in the company
in two services , 101 15- and 16 @-@ year @-@ old young people have been taken over by the Conservation Unit Am KleinHeuberg .

with the reception of the Firm , the youths said yes to their baptism and inherited the power of the Holy Spirit .
the Firmlings had been preparing for the big day in recent months , under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of many community members .
in various projects , they met various tasks of the Christian community and together experienced the Youth Day in Lower Power .
Illmensee : second mountain bike race thrilled participants
during glorious weather , 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to manage the round course across the hillsides around the lake .
Ulrich Knobel of the sports association Illmensee .
among the participants were , especially at the short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , many yachts who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competition atmosphere .
two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach @-@ Linz came up with the recommendation for good placements at the German Championships .
they were expected to leave the field .
as in the previous year , Felix Bader saved a small time lead to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance .
on second , Pascal Treubel was able to place himself again .
at the ladies , it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare who managed to top it up .
two and three came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen .
a welcome development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community .
not only in terms of performance , the full range of athletes was represented .
the age structure of ten was also the oldest starters for the youngest up to 70 years .
more absolute top athletes were at the start this year .
four drivers were able to take off from the regional top riders .
among them Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike half @-@ profi from the Black @-@ Tusk Racing team .
Pangerl , along with a teammate , has already been world champion in 12 @-@ hour driving two times .
this year he became European champion in this special discipline .
with Roland Ballerstedt , who already has two German championship titles in the duathlon .
after 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , there was a wearable final in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall .
Pangerl raced first over the finish line .
only a second behind it was the routine Ballerstedt secured second place in the overall standings .
at the same time Hermann and Warthmann were targeted as third of the overall rating .
in the women &apos;s standings , Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main .
Areane Blersch from Binzwgen secured second place before Natasha Werner from Stuttgart .
athletes and helpers were very pleased with the smooth and well organised course of the event .
travelling through mud , rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr Georges Bwave brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwave and his team spend nearly every weekend treating hundreds of patients
there are not many doctors in the West African country , just one for 5,000 people
vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwave is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013 .
you can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to elect him to the CNN Hero of the Year .
the winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work .
for 21 years , Georges Bwave looked at how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .
Jamef Bwave was injured in a car crash near Yaoundé , the capital Cameroon , in 1981 .
at first , he had only one broken arm , but then formed an inflammation that extended to his brain and caused a hematom there that should affect him for the rest of his life .
&quot; there were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , &quot; Georges Bwave said .
we would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had had the money .
instead , Bwave spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy , &quot; Bwave commented .
you can leave the house at 5 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .
there are very many patients .
some people even die because they have to wait .
the situation has barely changed since Bwelles &apos;s father died in 2002 .
in Cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .
on the other hand , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people .
but even if there was a doctor for them , most cameramen could not afford to visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three @-@ quarters of health spending in the country is private .
&quot; the only problem they have is poverty , &quot; Bwave says .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
to see his father and so many of his compatriots suffer in Bwelle , the decision to do something about it .
Dr Georges Bwave and his volunteer carried out 700 free operations last year .
he became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Central Hospital in Yaoundé .
he also founded a nonprofit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there .
since 2008 , he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people .
almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people forced themselves into minibuses and drive with the snowy medical equipment on the roof over unfortified terrain to the villages that need help .
not always running smoothly .
for more than once , they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud .
but when they arrive , they will receive like heroes : a festive meal , singing and dance and the best accommodation the place has to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and blow - with its broad smile and boundless energy - is happy to attend the happy celebration .
the next morning the team then begins investigating hundreds of patients .
&quot; per ride we treat 500 people , &quot; Bwelle said .
they come from a distance of 60 kilometres around the village - and that is on foot .
each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
others get crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document required for the school but many poor families simply can &apos;t afford .
in the evening , the team performs simple operations with local anesthetic .
the operations usually take place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the operation , patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next .
lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is fed by the group &apos;s generator and so Bwave and his volunteers work until early morning hours on Sunday .
it &apos;s an exhausting pencil , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .
&quot; they trot all night so we can stay awake and continue our work , &quot; says Bwave .
on Sunday the team then returns to the city , tired but proud of the work done .
the group - a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that , with its work , it makes a huge difference for the people it helps .
a man explained that the free operation of a boardwalk he received now allowed him to work again .
&quot; this changes the future of my family , &quot; the man said .
in addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital , Bwave also works at private clinics in Yaoundé at night .
with this second job , he finances 60 % of his nonprofit business , according to Bwelve ; the rest come from private donations .
&quot; I really don &apos;t know when he sleeps , &quot; says Katie O &apos;Malley , who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteered in Bwelles Group .
he is always in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns .
for medical and health care students such as O &apos;Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support Bwave , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .
&quot; we can be at operations where we help cover blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle , &quot; O &apos;Malley explains .
that would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .
students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanity material .
however , once they are in Yaoundé , Bwave takes over accommodation , transport and guidance .
&quot; he &apos;s definitely a hero , &quot; O &apos;Malley says .
he dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries .
for Bwave , almost permanent work is not a burden .
giving others a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he gave to his father gives him great pleasure .
&quot; I &apos;m so happy when I do this work , &quot; Bwave thinks .
and I think of my father .
I hope he sees what I do .
I do it to get people to laugh again and to alleviate the pain .

excellently mastered the fight
the role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway &apos;s Novelle &quot; The Old Man and the Sea , &quot; is Horst Janson cut to the body .
Janson is himself an old hase in his Metier , acting art .
none of Santiago &apos;s old man can do anything about fishing .
so the two simply add great value .
you almost think you can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man who speaks of the fishing boy Manolo .
if Santiago is tired of life lying on the chair , that &apos;s real at Janson .
in addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excellently performs .
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower .
Janson is on stage in broad stretches as a single actor .
he manages to focus the audience &apos;s attention on himself , so his monologue isn &apos;t a moment boring .
his efforts to finally move the fish to the surface of the water are so real that viewers forget that the sea consists only of blue @-@ lit water bottles .
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man operate in the boat in front of the fishing village .
in the course of the performance , he puts the active scene in the light : the refuge of Santiago , the bar of singer Marie @-@ Luise Gunst , who , with her songs and her wonderful voice , occupies Cuba &apos;s sense of life .
the four musicians play Cuba &apos;s rhythm and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : descent to the Romans
at about 120 metres in length , a sewage channel from Roman times is preserved below Cologne .
those who visit Cologne do not pass the cathedral .
about 157 metres , the two towers raged into the sky , making it the second @-@ highest church building in Europe .
but few visitors who marvel at the two filigree church towers suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral .
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne &apos;s underworld .
meeting point for his guided tours is the service centre of Cologne @-@ Tourism , right on the cathedral .
the tour begins quite unspectacular : &quot; we start in the underground car park , &quot; Schulze says .
in the seventies , the city &apos;s fathers wanted an autojust city , and therefore the remains of the old city wall remained just what was not too big .
most of the users of the car park are now also passing the Roman remains and only stop their car .
but if you look more closely , the D2 parking deck will detect an archaeological site separated by the metal grid .
you can see about five feet tall ruins of hand @-@ made stones .
&quot; it is remnants of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century after Christ , &quot; Schulze told me .
before going back to daylight , Schulze lets attendees at the upper parking level still take a look in a sinister , 15 feet deep shaft .
this is the fountain of the old cathedral , which is unfortunately hardly perceived .
next station of the roundabout is the Pretorium , and here participants get back down to depth .
we see here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the precursor of the CCAA .
what CCAA means is a visitor wants to know .
&quot; the abbreviation stands for &quot; Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium , &quot; which in good German means &quot; city Roman law and city of Agrippinenser , founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor . &quot;
and the Pretorium is the former statue palace , the centre of the Roman empire on the Rhine .
from the front of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman sewage channel , which is preserved here at about 120 metres .
&quot; you can quietly depart a piece along the so @-@ called Cloaca Maxima if you want , &quot; Schulze told guests .
a surprise still has Schulze .
after picking up the key at the box office , he leads the group to a 16 @-@ metre deep , walk @-@ in shaft .
&quot; we are now in the Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing .
to date , in the lower end of the micro , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels are readable by changing pegel of the Rhine .
the Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone in Town Hall Square , for which construction work is due to begin shortly .
until completion , however , some years will pass .
leg almost hacked : reissue of rocker trial
a bloody attack in the Rockermilieu is rolled out after more than four years .
a trial of attempted homicide , dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30 @-@ year @-@ olds has begun in the District Court of Frankfurt ( Oder ) .
it is accompanied by strict safeguards .
the defendants sneaked for the kick @-@ off .
they were said to have been active in the rocker scene and were then among the bandidos .
the prosecution accuses them of stabbing and assaulting three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt in June 2009 .
all the victims were seriously injured , a man would almost have lost his leg .
the victims are said to have belonged to competing grouping Hells Angels .
one should have been a senior member from Berlin .
presumably , a chase with several cars was running out .
according to the indictment , it involved revisions and a demonstration of power .
the two defendants were acquitted in an initial trial in early 2012 .
a court spokesman said at the time it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud .
the perpetrators had carried masks and had not been identified .
the Federal Court of Justice annulled the ruling after overhauling the prosecutor &apos;s office and dismissed it for re @-@ trial to the county court .
one of the defendants is currently in open execution because of another delicacy .
it was mainly about the reconstruction of the procedures in the crime scene .
the Commissioner was invited to testify .
at the center were cell phone calls from the defendants and other people who had been intercepted by police .
it is difficult that rockers in court almost always adhere to a law for them to marry - and not testify .
this also applies to the victims .
in the first trial , only one of the victims had been packed out .
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office Frankfurt ( Oder ) said on demand that new marks had emerged since the latest trial .
eleven more days of negotiation are scheduled for the process .
the disposable company doesn &apos;t think
the night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but eventually it goes home .
only : in people &apos;s belongings on the front @-@ passenger and back seat , hunger is noticeable .
clearly , one or more cocktail or champagne may be responsible for this !
what is closer than to driving chilly to the next drive @-@ in to give yourself a little bit ?
I admit , I &apos;m happy to be here when it comes to late @-@ night or early morning fast @-@ food beans .
a few fries , a cola , a burger - and then nix as from home and into bed !
but on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco giants are noticeable .
after all , what does it have to be missing that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with stable regularity ? !
in particular , on weekends there are carved paper bags on roadside and parking places .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wonder .
are people too doof to take the bags home respectful to the next trash ?
it is not just the case that the paper product is a waste of the landscape .
bags have also already concealed transport facilities , such as railroads , causing accidents .
but what is thought of as a &quot; disposable society , &quot; presumably it does not even know what that word actually means .
if you &apos;re travelling more often in the evening , just right with several people in the car , you know what a backbench can look like after sophisticated nights : clams , bottles and other garbage are out there .
there would be a few bags more or less even nix - unlike the road , where no one wants to walk on the food list of others .
I already see the day when cities and communities will be able to blow the way - and the fast food chains will have to demand for their bags .
Obama &apos;s Return in Health Policy
after fierce criticism , President Obama made a retreat yesterday on his frequently repeated , clear promise : &quot; if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . &quot;
after hundreds of thousands received a letter of termination from their insurer , Republicans accused the president in recent days of deceiving the American public .
yesterday , Obama relented his original promise .
&quot; the vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , &quot; he said at a speech in Boston .
in response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals , Obama urged Americans who received such communications to look around the free market for new insurance .
most citizens could receive better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast .
&quot; they come up with a better offer , &quot; he said .
the government described it as little surprise that the five per cent of the population who have themselves completed insurance would have to look for another tariff , as their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .
&quot; I want to say very directly to these Americans : they deserve better , &quot; Sebelius said at a hearing before the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington .
Sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Acts , said the launch of the online platform had been &quot; miserable &quot; since October .
&quot; I &apos;m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else , &quot; she said .
I &apos;m determined to regain your confidence .
this exclamation of a raised Sebelius to a behind @-@ her @-@ seat adviser at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the House of Representatives was recorded after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri , which was about whether she should be required to attend Obamacare .
after more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius repeatedly urged the question of why the &quot; architect &quot; of the Affordable Care Acts did not voluntarily renounce state @-@ sponsored insurance to complete a tariff at HealthCare.gov , which she now wants to sell millions of Americans .
government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air base
an American government official , who wanted to remain anonymous , on Thursday claimed to the American news channel CNN that Israeli warplanes attacked an air base in Syria &apos;s Latakia a day earlier .
the goal was &quot; rockets and related equipment , &quot; which the Israeli government feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as Arab broadcaster Al @-@ Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been fired on Thursday night from Wednesday , blaming the Israelis .
Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia , on which Russian defensive missiles from type S @-@ 125 Newa , as well as a battery of SA @-@ 3 missiles could be seen , which Channel 2 says has a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads up to 70 kilograms .
unsure The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack .
however , the Reuters news agency quoted an equally anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believes Israel carried out the attack , but is not certain .
a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said at least , &quot; We don &apos;t comment on these reports . &quot;
journalist Ron Ben @-@ Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried earlier , partly successfully , to supply ground air missiles to Hezbollah .
the Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant crossing a &quot; red line &quot; that would follow a military response .
John Kerry declares in an unprecedented admission that the U.S. espionage has gone &quot; inappropriate too far &quot;
John Kerry hinted with an unexpected admission a softening of the US &apos;s defensive stance on its surveillance programs , saying the espionage had gone &quot; unduly too far &quot; in certain cases .
the foreign minister also admitted that he , along with Barack Obama , was guilty of being switched to &quot; autopilot &quot; when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA &apos;s spy activities became public .
through leaked information , the U.S. government has come into a diplomatic storm of outrage from its allies .
speaking by video link at the Open Government conference in London , Kerry said : &quot; without question , the president and I , as well as others in the government , have learned of some things that have almost expired by autopilot , simply because the ability to do so was what still happened to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , to September 11 . &quot;
he then acknowledged as the first senior member of the US government that the US espionage had crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights had been abused .
he said : &quot; in some cases this has gone too far . &quot;
the President is determined to provide clarity and therefore carries out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here .
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process .
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved by its surveillance operations .
he added : &quot; we are dealing with a new world where people are willing to splash themselves into the air . &quot;
there is radical extremism in the world that has failed to kill people , spill into the air and attack governments .
so what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happens ?
we actually prevented plane crashes , attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we learned about such plans in advance .
meanwhile , U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to allay concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the U.S. on anti @-@ terrorism efforts , the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday .
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti @-@ terrorism organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency .
&quot; it is very important for the US national security interests that Europeans remain on board in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism , &quot; Murphy , who is serving as a Democrat for the first time in the Senate and acting as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , said in an interview in Washington .
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes .
media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have impacted relations with some U.S. allies , although the head of the intelligence service this week said the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by Nato allies and exchanged with the United States .
other revelations cited from Snowden &apos;s wider documents that the NSA monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s mobile phone and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .
the head of national intelligence , James clapper , defended the espionage among allies as necessary and said this was common on both sides .
in all the tumult , Murphy said his authority was preparing the Congress &apos; trip to take place this year and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers .
the names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days .
he said the exact itinerary is still being worked out .
while Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations , he also talked about there being some &quot; serious words . &quot;
he said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes they themselves have used for years .
&quot; while we can change our surveillance programmes and protect Europeans &apos; rights better , they also have to cope with the fact that we are not the only ones spiking , &quot; Murphy concluded .
meanwhile , John Kerry faces a trip to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to address the resentment of the US strategy in Syria , Egypt and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities .
a persistent injury to the ankle threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga draw of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg .
Mainz bent around a deployment of Nicolai Müller .
tomorrow he will try to train with the team .
so far he has been able to do that only individually .
&quot; we will decide on his use in the short term , &quot; coach Thomas Tuchel said .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old hopes to have his with six hits best goalscoring .
because maintainers already have to give up on the injured service provider Niki Zimling , Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert .
Australian sets appeal against prison sentence in Thailand
a 21 @-@ year @-@ old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the ruling and has been released on bail .
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 of making a false statement after she told Thai police a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday , June 10 , while two other men held her .
later , however , the footage of a video camera showed she had safely reached her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend .
police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they confessed to having thought out the story .
until the trial , she was in police custody on the ground .
Bamford was sentenced to a 15 @-@ day prison sentence in a detention centre with low security levels on the outskirts of Phuket , rather than in a prison for adult women .
she is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player in the Australian Rubgy League who contacted the State Department in Canberra with asking for help for his daughter .
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was &quot; extremely concerned &quot; about his daughter &apos;s welfare and wanted her back in Australia .
&quot; we &apos;re obviously worried about it , but we hope it &apos;s back home as soon as possible , &quot; Tunks said .
Bamford has appealed against the ruling and is on a bail of 50,000 Baht at large .
in Australian reports , it was read that in the meantime it is holiday in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand .
the court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults .
however , it is also possible that after the recent assassination of the travel clerk Michelle Smith in Phuket , Thailand may be trying to improve its troubled tourist image , and that is why it is becoming an acquittal .
