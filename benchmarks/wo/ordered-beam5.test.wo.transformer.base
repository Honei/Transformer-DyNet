When William UNK unk his occasion , the Supreme Court will differ sharply from the tenure of his N marks today on the previous year of Justice Court .
For the first time , the court finds almost exclusively in his influence in dissent , rather than a high time as the majority force 's N justice .
This reversal for his role holds three allies , Harry UNK , Marshall Stevens , and UNK , as well as moderate liberal and UNK .
But these players assume four different of them , on their role in N , a court , collectively are ready to assume the role of four years after high N ?
Every indication that the new role is prepared to accept four different ways , but that it are in the unk , with this role and go .
UNK UNK and Marshall Stevens appear mad about fighting it ; UNK and UNK unk appear .
The justices often criticize the four newcomers in dissent , no conservative forces are joining to criticize the court 's past decade .
But in the past years , they have always been able to vote out a number of unk civil rights and unk victories , and a major trend in unk up to pick .
Now , however , the five-member court 's unk are rare for conservative victories , as the majority continues to unk .
The most dramatic change for Justice Justice is the liberal majority of Justice Justice UNK , under the last N unk .
In N , the Supreme Court decided the height of Justice Court 's cast the power by the unk N votes from seven cases in the spring of N , through the court of UNK N .
Last term in N , he cast the contentious victory alone as only N votes unk his big decisions with unk .
But in N , Justice UNK strongly unk the importance of defending his new speech .
Each time , he said , the court will be forced to reconsider the unk by dissent and `` a fundamental issue '' to the justices .
Moreover , he said , that when he was winning tables in the recent months in the future he knew that the tables might turn on the side .
He now has felt that the most frequent opinions was a reference to the Justice Court 's Mr. Warren knows how to unk the conservative , Justice Court now he said .
Justice Associates say he was `` depressed '' about N civil rights to speak out of the court 's role in court last spring , but the direction is determined about his unk and depressed court .
`` We 'm not going to hide it under a sweep last month , but it could do it , '' he said in the speech and unk .
He has n't escaped a highly important point for that future legal scholars , like the Justice UNK , considers unk , legal scholars .
Harvard Law School says there is a current `` unk flavor to unk Laurence Tribe . ''
The court , suggesting that he might soon be writing the direction for short-term unk , in the Court 's direction , says Warren .
`` Marshall and UNK are more speaking in their future to a distant unk , '' he says .
Justice also seems new unk about N , who will turn his role next month , UNK .
Roe vs. Wade Associates , especially in his first opinion , say he takes some attempts to curtail more than the N Roe vs. unk right to curtail his colleagues .
Justice and UNK UNK said he saw no more than the associates who was discouraged during the summer court in recent years .
And his successful outlook after August improved unk surgery in surgery .
But in a recent speech , hundreds of lawyers showed his level of frustration to a group of unk in Chicago .
He concluded those emotionally from the late March N , and said Martin UNK , a speech on quoting `` Have the length at his present UNK King 's remarks , '' according to Washington .
Stevens also enjoys the majority of the more liberal liberal than four others because he may be part of his role in the Justice , but , because he is unk the most liberal of the N , arguing the challenge with the unk .
If one is an important way , these watchers also say it is one unk role in history , assuming a modern court from the Supreme Court in recent history .

He said he parallels the emphasis on program trading , including many stocks of the N unk and computerized unk with takeover emphasis .
`` The only thing you do n't have the rest ' portfolio , '' he said , `` is unk on the insurance phenomenon . ''
Most institutional investors have abandoned the hedging technique , which is widely thought to unk the N crash .
Not really the S&P futures contracts was designed to soften an offsetting blow of this profit by selling waves , and declining futures contracts .
In effect , stock prices became the unk test of its insurance portfolio and disappeared in the N crash , and did n't work as buyers did unk $ N billion in stock prices .

The Senate 's decision to approve a deficit-reduction tax cut this year leaves the possibility of a capital-gains tax cut bill without enacting a unk reduction .
Late Friday , the Senate voted to approve an estimated $ N billion deficit that would have been stripped , rather than hundreds of federal budget provisions , the measure had narrowed .
Lawmakers breaks criticism that the bill was unk with bloated special-interest spending and blunt criticism to blunt it .
`` We 're being putting back a deficit-reduction bill , '' said Chairman James Sasser -LRB- D. , a category of the Senate Budget Committee in UNK . -RRB- .
But some supporters said that the Senate had been moving through legislation that would soon carry aside a capital-gains tax cut of other bills , including the unk cast of Congress .
In addition , the deficit-reduction bill already includes a capital-gains provision passed by the House .
House-Senate and negotiations are likely to begin at a unk while for last .
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole -LRB- R. , one -RRB- said , `` No one can happen on what the House side will predict . ''
But Republicans believe , he added , `` I will get together to work this year and I believe capital-gains reform . ''
White House Budget Director Richard Darman told reporters yesterday that the capital-gains bill would n't keep the final version of the administration to cut in the bill .
`` We do n't need this as a capital way to get gains , '' he said .
`` If that comes from the House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta -LRB- D. , Calif , that 's a great signal will help the deal in an interview . -RRB-
The Senate will make a capital-gains decision this year 's approval for President Bush and was less a setback of certain tax .
Opponents of the cut are playing unk .
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said he was confident that the capital-gains tax agreement would n't include any legislation on a `` deficit-reduction . ''
And the House Ways Committee said there are n't any tax plans to carry a bill this year , where legislation could produce a senior aide to tax cut and produce `` unk gains , '' another tax aide .
One popular legislation , perhaps , is the obvious place to attach the capital-gains tax cut from the deficit-reduction bill and raise other items to raise federal borrowing .
Such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month .
The Senate bill was pared back to speed through an deficit-reduction attempt in Congress .
Because the deficit-reduction legislation has n't been completed until midnight tonight , President Bush has been completed by across-the-board spending cuts to enact tonight .
Senators hope that the House will need to avoid those unk cuts to the bill .

Hertz Corp. 's rival UNK Inc. said it is backing out of three frequent-flier programs , following rival , UNK .
The company said it wo n't renew contracts at the end of this year 's unk contracts with Pan American Airlines Inc. unit , Northwest , Garden Am Corp. , N.Y. , and Pan American Airlines unit 's Pan Am Corp. unit .
But it remains involved in AMR Corp. 's American Air Lines unit with AMR Corp. and AMR Corp. .
Industry 's UNK put annual cost of all programs and estimates at between $ N million .
A spokesman for UNK said the account would n't specify the total of `` less than half the costs being dropped for airlines . ''
UNK Systems Inc. , Minneapolis , said they had no plans to follow suit , and a suit of both National Car Corp. of Chicago .
In fact , Budget indicated it can earn discounts involved in some frequent-flier programs , which saw these frequent-flier benefit to get unk and unk .
`` I can not see how this can benefit by news programs , '' said Hertz UNK , vice president 's Budget Budget and Budget planning .
Northwest and Budget has five agreements with the airlines of which are UNK .
Delta National Northwest Group also unk along with USAir 's frequent-flier program , including four other airlines and USAir Inc. in the program .
A month ago , the end of that it would drop its marketing agreements with United Airlines and USAir Corp. 's United Airlines , Texas Air Corp. and American Airlines , N.J. , marketing , and Hertz Ridge said that after Dec. N would be unk sometime .
At Hertz , the airlines said that the value of those awards amounted to $ N million and topped its annual fees to $ N million .
Analysts doubt that the numbers were high , however , and competitors high .
UNK Budget said its frequent-flier costs `` are substantially below . ''
`` The proliferation of -LCB- frequent-flier programs -RCB- have significantly diminished their value , and costs attached to their frequent-flier , '' said Robert D. UNK , vice president .

If Saatchi emerges , Charles Saatchi & Saatchi Co. official said the company will lead an attempt to unk a hostile buy-out for Saatchi , and Maurice Saatchi .
Financing in New York may be problematic for Friday 's stock-market sell-off in any attempt and the wake of the takeover market in junk-bond turmoil .
But last week Maurice Saatchi , which has been named chief executive officer of the beleaguered British consulting giant , has a intense takeover for the subject to replace new speculation and advertising .
Last week , UNK Asset Management , a third parties approached by Saatchi 's largest shareholder , said it had been interested in more possible restructuring or one .
And Backer Spielvogel Bates , chief executive officer of Saatchi 's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit , said he had rebuffed the buy-out of Saatchi management , but was offered by a big company .
Mr. Spielvogel said he would n't launch a hostile bid .
The Saatchi executive said it came to beat crazy , but that if Saatchi & Saatchi knew it would n't have to offer up a choice with a high offer , which came crazy to a unk offer .
But it would come back with an offer by -LCB- management -RCB- otherwise . ''
The current buy-out is believed to be led by Saatchi and Maurice Saatchi , whose chairman said the board would force any strategic unk .
Mr. Spielvogel is n't part of any other ad agencies , nor are part of the board of Saatchi 's UNK .
The executive said Saatchi would have upward price of $ N billion , but analysts did n't fetch any securities .
The brothers denied speculation that Saatchi was bringing up the lead executive officer to clean the company so that a new buy-back could lead in the only financially executive .
That becomes a new appointment as Robert UNK , who analyzed its appointment of Saatchi and chief executive speculation Friday , as the board member of the industry on Jan. N .
Mr. UNK , formerly chief executive manager of Saatchi International Inc. , has charged Mr. Saatchi 's poor financial reputation as a state and will be charged with repairing the research firm .
Asked about the reason for the buy-out has been hired by the brothers , Mr. Dreyfus replied that `` That is n't a unk in the way , the executive has been brought to speculation .
He was brought to turn around in the company . ''
Separately , Saatchi said they believe the company 's management will have little shakeup on them .
`` It has had any impact on we do n't expect to expect us , nor had a major client , '' said Backer Spielvogel Brewing , a spokeswoman for Backer Spielvogel .
John Advertising , director of Saatchi & Saatchi Inc. , a client director at PaineWebber , said : `` We do n't know what we have no problem with the announcement , because it 's going to bring advertising .
We are n't going to change because of a change in London . ''
Executives at Backer Spielvogel Lighting Inc. said they also saw client Lighting Inc. , as well as no effect .
Executives at Backer Spielvogel Securities Inc. , a Prudential-Bache Securities , declined comment that its client is reviewing .
Backer Spielvogel , a Prudential-Bache buy-out or Prudential-Bache , said that Mr. Spielvogel had prepared him to finance a restructuring of management was led by either alone .

Of all the troublesome tensions in America , which is the most right now ?
A good bet in the New York City Jews would be between blacks and blacks .
Or unk Jackie Mason -LRB- ABC -RRB- must seem to unk a new veteran on the Jewish unk , so it airing in N p.m. EDT Tuesday .
Not only he 's a star of `` UNK Soup Chicken , '' Mr. Mason 's tradition , is also a hot unk in the water and currently dating back to the unk of Mr. Mason .
Here in Mr. Mason , while he was quoted in the first campaign of the mayoral campaign , and then unk UNK UNK UNK , he paid a neutral spokesman for the company 's unk language in the mayoral campaign .
Mr. Mason said that they feel guilty unk , so many blacks feel guilty toward Jewish support .
He said that so many black candidates , too , they feel bitter unk about racial discrimination , black voters .
He said that Jews have contributed to the vice unk causes over black years .
Of course , Mr. Mason did not neutral language use .
As the humor of the old days , Mr. Mason reached a unk on television for the UNK circuit unk , live from the unk and ethnic unk .
He said he called David Dinkins 's opponent , a black opponent with Mr. Giuliani ; and Jews were `` a unk , '' with sick unk complexes `` . ''
If Mr. Mason had his fellow analysis of the UNK unk hot language used to the unk of New UNK , so his behavior would be quite less ?
It probably would have bothered Mr. Mason 's comments because of the fact that he used to upset the substance of people between his unk and the language , or none by few comments .
In addition , Mr. Mason 's critics have a implied form of humor of ethnic itself that is racism some of his form .
For example , Mr. Mason said that the state is like a unk counsel for the New York state .
People are stuck where the place he is leaving fast . ''
These unk aims to humor that the group is aiming at another type of ethnic jokes ; as well as the `` unk '' that fail , ethnic unk and ethnic unk , such as unk .
The latter is typically unk along with the stage of humor and their audiences , and it was unk by both the unk of a white unk and Jews as blacks on the audiences .
In this audience , Bruce UNK could cut both the hands of the ribbons and unk like a unk to the audience .
But Jackie Mason is a constructive form of unk by a pro unk , like it .
Why ?
Both groups are unk in politics : Both , and they can not serve as one unk conflict about respect despite the unk of the media and easing for unk politics in all they are similar .
That 's why it thought to mention critical of all differences on college , unk and well-intentioned group 's taboo group , have thought critical police elsewhere .
Perhaps such differences in New York were allowed to intensity over the intensity , `` Elizabeth Mason would not just if the UNK unk unk with honest unk . ''
The other humor of letting steam is unk -LRB- if we do exist , and if they still have other conflicts -RRB- , Mr. Mason 's group unk for what means is , as if they do off ?
Do n't say that happens to offend its desperate , nobody resembles more than everybody because it resembles in the TV comedy , unk , and that does n't need to be a unk .
The blue-collar group vs. `` UNK '' is true to allow yuppies in the best unk differences : `` It vs. UNK Show ; unk children that do . ''
But these differences are not that make the headlines .
In his brother , Michael UNK -LRB- `` In Lynn UNK '' -RRB- , the Irish mother plays a courting Jewish mother , and unk against Jackie Lynn UNK -LRB- `` UNK '' -RRB- , an widow of his brother , wishes and Mr. Mason .
It 's noting that both relatives are worth unk .
At least , with strong unk and Jackie UNK , they do both speak as strong .
`` It is n't an obvious recipe that could be made more being Soup '' from old .
And if the question were an safe member of a unk between UNK and UNK -- one of the UNK UNK in a question .
Back so , the author of Anne Rose has made a popular suit that entered the Irish unk of the `` Irish '' plot between Anne and its unk , the unk of the UNK 's popular grounds that entered immigrants in N and the public on the movie .
And there was evidenced by the sole distinction of its unk marriage , David UNK , whose N unk called `` UNK '' and UNK David UNK has remained a unk distinction that it was evidenced in Meredith to UNK .
`` Clearly , it will question whether the unk pot is not over , but with whether it will unk at all , '' the Chicken Soup .
So far , far between the few and unk have been .
Part of the problem , Norman UNK , is unk about the social issues of all unk tendency to the days since ever .
To show this tendency to reversing us , some ethnic unk emerges about the extent whenever them tries by unk .
For instance , he 's not become a shrewd job because he unk Jackie Michael 's social businessman , but in order to unk his worker as a unk .
Even Mr. Mason 's comic unk is more problematic unk between the unk and unk .
The best moments occasionally show to the end when Mr. Mason starts in the middle unk and unk himself as well as old-fashioned out at the end -LRB- his unk -RRB- , and to occur into the Jewish people that starts in other unk .
But because these differences like this unk , Mr. Mason 's lack , ethnic stock is too timid , often spark all too unk trade in unk .
I 'm not suggesting that episodes like the convent UNK UNK at putting together about the dispute over the producers .
That issue , like racial tensions , will have to cool up heat before it , not , in New York City .
But I am suggesting that Mr. Mason would sound sound unk about the lips of America on his line with some people suggesting that they would stop `` unk for classic America to unk . ''
At age , without turning up your soup , you ca n't know that the flame ought to make .
Earnings in the third quarter have moved ahead of newer , especially pharmaceutical makers , with most major drugs believed to unk for the nation 's unk .
For most of the third consecutive quarter , however , revenues were battered by the strong foreign-currency dollar as a result of abroad ' adverse revenues .
Analysts said that the new profit benefited from the unk unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb & Co. , Warner-Lambert Co. , Eli Lilly & Co. , and Eli Lilly & Co. that provide strong sales of all Warner-Lambert Co. .
Less Co. and Upjohn Inc. attributed competition from many other companies ' unk products , which were robust earnings and older drugs at those of unk to face competition .
Joseph UNK , an analyst with Bear Stearns & Co. , said that most other businesses have shed savings and administrative staffs over the past few years , consolidating manufacturing makers such as Bear , have instituted their cost and unk businesses .
As a result , Mr. UNK said , revenues are `` very significant '' on having a new company with major impact .
Analysts said the drug is estimated to have climbed between N % and N % , so big makers have climbed for a dozen , or profit .
While that 's not especially if the economy turns spectacular , Neil UNK , an analyst with Prudential UNK , said , `` the downward growth rate will look compared with good to other companies . ''
UNK by Merck , an estimated N % of its unk drug sales ; UNK , a fast-growing quarter , rose about N % , including the unk of its prescription medicine ; and UNK , an estimated unk , propelled drug pressure for prescription medicine .
Profit climbed to one of the dollar 's `` even though strong sales were reduced by three percentage points , '' Mr. UNK said .
In the third quarter , Merck earned $ N million , or N cents a share .
In a Merck spokesman , UNK , N.J. , company said the earnings does n't make projections .
Mr. UNK said he estimated that Lilly 's earnings jumped about N % , largely because of the new performance of its unk for the quarter .
The drug , introduced last year , is expected to generate about $ N million of sales .
`` It 's turning out to be a real blockbuster , '' said Mr. UNK .
In last year 's third quarter , Lilly earned $ N million , or $ N a share .
In Indianapolis , Lilly declined comment .
Several analysts said it expected to increase profit by more than $ N million , or $ N a share , like Warner-Lambert 's profit from $ N million in the last year .
The company is praised with numerous oil companies and shedding margins sharply in recent years for lowering its profit by low costs .
The company 's earnings growth , allowed power to lean cholesterol from its unk operation , UNK , analysts said .
UNK sales are expected to be about $ N million in N , up from $ N million this year .
In a spokesman for the Plains , N.J. , company said the analysts ' projections are `` in the unk . ''
UNK by treating its strong profit was estimated to $ N million , or $ N a share , in the third quarter , especially above the heart of the disease 's high profit of $ N million , and other analysts estimated it earned N % for pressure .
The company was officially merged with Bristol-Myers Co. earlier this month .
Bristol-Myers declined to comment .
Mr. UNK said profit are largely expected to increase about N % of Bear Stearns Corp. 's N % rise , and that `` those companies really managed to rise N % because of Bear 's profit . ''
Bristol-Myers earned $ N million , or N cents a share , while the UNK earned $ N million , or N cents a share , in a year earlier .
In the problems by Schering-Plough , N.J. , company said that the third-quarter earnings rose N % to $ N per share , with a `` average '' for about $ N a share .
The company spokesman said it expects to achieve the full-year earnings per share in the spring , as projected , in the N % increase .
Meanwhile , Pfizer 's recent quarterly earnings were about N % in the quarter , as analysts said continued to string performances by lackluster analysts .
Sales of UNK , Pfizer 's heart unk , have increased competition for treating medicine , drugs and a important unk of UNK .
`` The dollar hurt a lot too strong , '' said Pfizer , Mr. UNK . -RRB-
In the third quarter last year , Pfizer earned $ N million , or $ N a share .
In New York , the company declined comment .
Analysts said they expected it to be earned only about N % to $ N million , or N cents a share , compared with Upjohn 's flat profit rise by N % a year ago .
Upjohn 's UNK , a unk , and UNK are a unk drugs .
Sales of both prescriptions and unk drugs have been hurt by restricting the adverse use of certain publicity about the state of the new laws .
Also , the drug has been reduced by Upjohn 's print profit for the company 's unk drug , and television campaigns , but at about $ N million -- is well expensive for the year , analysts said .
In comment , Upjohn UNK , Mich. .
The profits could persist through the rest of the year 's oil industry unk .
Major oil companies are largely robust next year ago , and they did much less than expected to report gasoline prices for the third quarter in the deteriorating oil prices .
The chemicals industry may remain weak , but analysts say , chemicals and gasoline profits are likely to improve their chances , reducing profits that may remain next quarter .
The volume of Phillips Petroleum Co. in petrochemicals , in an interview , Glenn Cox , said `` certainly a somewhat softening and is softening in seeing industry . ''
That `` obviously will change the third quarter for earnings and fourth quarter , '' he added .
He did n't forecast Phillips 's results .
But analysts say the lower third-quarter earnings will probably be among companies and a weak post in chemical prices .
So many analysts , Exxon Corp. , Amoco Corp. , will predict , and Chevron Corp .
Typical is the vast commodity chemical companies produced by many major amounts of what happened to unk , in a price .
It has plunged N % to around N cents a pound since July .
A unk unk for December N sold at about N cents last year ago , N cents .
A big reason for the chemical price is unk retreat .
Beginning in the U.S. economy began growing demand , as a accelerating N dollar spurred and growing demand .
Companies added unk capacity .
Now , while domestic economic growth is stronger , supplies are greatly stronger , and the dollar is increased on the market .
Third-quarter profits were weaker from gasoline .
William Refining , a securities analyst at First Boston Corp , said last year were `` generally very good and so good margins in the third quarter of this year . ''
Oil in July ran out flat season for August and driving that a company did n't materialize to prepare a robust holiday season .
The period pushed gasoline prices that supply down in excess .
In addition , crude oil prices were pressuring up further , a year earlier from some profitability .
UNK margins in September picked up many of this quarter , though gasoline and gasoline industry officials say , not to rebound in the fourth quarter 's level .
During the second half , many chemical companies posted record N gasoline and half .
Crude oil companies may turn out to be surprising this year the most of production element .
Prices have stayed averaging roughly $ N a barrel higher than expectations -- well above the third quarter in most companies ' expectations .
Demand typically has been stronger than in the fourth quarter , and it has unk much anticipated .
`` We could see higher prices this year , '' said Bryan UNK , an oil analyst at PaineWebber Inc .
That oil prices fell sharply below $ N a barrel to $ N in the fourth quarter , particularly when oil profits will translate into higher last year .
While oil prices have been better worse than expected , natural gas prices have been expected .
In the third quarter , they were averaged about N % less than they were in N .
The main reason remains weather .
Last summer the drought was increased to burn a wave that demand for electrical air conditioning and more natural gas from utilities to use .
This summer , on the other hand , had unk than usual weather .
`` We 've been very disappointed , '' said Mr. Cox , president of the Phillips 's natural gas performance in prices .
`` The fourth quarter is not going to assist many gas performance as expected . ''
Going into natural gas prices , the fourth quarter are lower than anywhere to N % from N % a year earlier .
For instance , the Gulf Coast currently produced N thousand feet around $ N cubic cubic feet from a year ago , along on a spot market for selling the natural gas market down N % .
As a weekend , small mutual fund managers said : As big investors have unk against big withdrawals of their phone funds over the weekend with any phone calls .
Unlike the weekend Monday , Black funds were n't swamped with heavy requests before the withdrawal .
And many fund managers say they have built buying up stock levels and cash levels will be built this week .
At Fidelity Investments , the nation 's largest fund company , the telephone volume was still up just half of Monday , but it was in weekend volume at the preceding N level .
The Boston firm said redemptions were running less than one-third the unk level at two years ago .
As of yesterday afternoon , Fidelity 's stock funds represented about N % of the total cash position of less than $ N billion of redemptions .
`` Two years ago , there were a lot of fear over the weekend and massive redemption levels around $ N billion , '' said Bruce UNK , who runs Fidelity C. Investments ' Fund .
`` This feels more like a unk deal .
People are n't unk . ''
The test may come today .
Friday 's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act .
Some shareholders would take place today 's exchanges after closing made off today because any fund 's exchanges have held at closing prices .
Black did n't begin unk redemptions during the market debacle until Monday on the Stock Stock market opened to N .
But fund managers say they 're ready .
Many buffer cash declines against a steep market , which have raised levels as declines .
Mario Gabelli , for instance , holds well above his N % in cash positions of several funds .
John Neff said they had raised their cash levels to N % and more than N % this year 's Series Mutual Fund , and John Neff .
Even Peter UNK , the nation 's largest manager of Fidelity Fund , built up N % to $ N million , or $ N billion .
One reason that net inflows is net inflows from investors , and investors posted in September after the monthly fund of two years of money .
`` I 've had trouble finding that he likes stocks , '' said Mr. Lynch , who likes the money he has let up .
Not all of course , funds have raised cash levels .
As the latest figures , available as a group of assets held in August , N % of cash from the Investment Company Institute .
That was N % higher than the N % levels of September and modestly in August and N % .
Also , some fund managers would force redemptions to dump cash to raise stocks .
But investor managers said a strong level of withdrawals around this time , much more is unlikely .
A major reason that stock funds have already scaled back since Black Monday is already major purchases of their purchases .
UNK purchases have rebounded monthly sales at less than half , but net levels are still running in recent months .
`` There 's not nearly unk , '' said John UNK , chairman of Vanguard Group Inc. , a big fund , Pa. , company .
Many fund managers argue that the fund 's time to buy now .
Woolworth Fund in Dun & Bradstreet and his manager , UNK , Bristol-Myers Squibb , added $ N billion to the positions of Wellington .
And he 'll be bolstered by stocks today , Pfizer and Eli Lilly Products have been looking to buy American stock yields like drug yields .
Mr. Fidelity 's stock got hammered up for the part , after his shares snapped Friday , Southern Co. .
If he drops today , Bristol-Myers said he 'll be buying the blue market as further and such chips .
`` If you dream that kind of stocks is like an opportunity about it presents the unk , '' he said , `` that day . ''
Major mutual-fund groups said normal pace were unk at the weekend yesterday .
But most investors were seeking share prices and other information .
Trading volume was only higher than normal .
Still , fund groups are n't taking any chances .
They hope that some phone investors jammed snags to avoid the unk and other phone lines in October N .

The centers normally are closed through the weekend .
In addition , instead of this normal N centers will open at the East Coast EDT , N .
T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. increased its staff to handle phone representatives of investor requests .
The UNK group noted that some investors moved money from money-market funds to stock funds .
`` But most investors seemed to be in a transaction rather than in most , '' said Steven UNK , a vice president .
And it was among other phone groups , investors said , adding more to help get through Vanguard today .
In an toll-free move , several phone funds moved to calm their lines with investors on an unusual recordings .
`` We view us as a weekend offering -LCB- long-term funds -RCB- at the weekend , '' said Gabelli & Co. 's recording market decline as a buying opportunity .
The investors had a similar recording for UNK Group .
Several fund managers expect a rough market before this morning .
Some investors who want to stem fat profits from selling early this year 's portfolio is likely to want to lock in investors and selling .
Stock funds have averaged N % of September through a staggering gain , according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc .
Analysis UNK UNK Inc. , who runs Shearson Lehman Hutton 's selling at least N points , predicts the market will open down $ N million on some panic and technical factors . ''
But she expects the stock market to decline more than N % from recent highs and she wo n't decline to N % is telling investors .
`` This is not a major crash , '' she said .
Nevertheless , Ms. UNK said she was swamped with phone calls over the weekend from shareholders .
`` Half of them are really scared and trying to sell , '' she said , `` I 'm trying to talk out it . ''
She added , `` If they 'd really be upset , I 'd really upset all . ''
The backdrop of the fund 's slide was markedly different from Friday , managers argue that October N to crash .
Two years ago , the dollar was very weak , unlike interest rates , they say , and the market was rising unk .
`` From Monday , the institutions learned a painful lesson and selling by individuals ' institutions , '' said Stephen Boesel , manager of T. Rowe Price Fund and Income Fund at $ N million on the standpoint ... .

For this quarter , the industry will be `` a negative year-to-year '' with some of these companies , says Leonard UNK , a chemical analyst at Prudential Research UNK .

Most estimates for Monsanto run between $ N and $ N a share .
A year ago , the company posted third-quarter profit of $ N million , or $ N a share , on sales of $ N billion .
Monsanto declined to comment .
But the producers are caught on the downside of a unk pricing cycle .
By the end , demand are firmer on Wall Street and some accounts , which may presage the inventory in an industry near .
But the unk pressure on production could keep growing capacity into early N .
In the latest quarter , profit is expected to fall sharply , at least .
`` For far , we do n't know how it is down , '' says Leslie UNK , Salomon Brothers Inc. at UNK .
The neighborhood was restated to $ N million , compared with a share of $ N million a share , when sales of $ N million are in N cents a year earlier .

Boeing Co. announced Friday because it will postpone delays from receiving new air service by UNK Airlines from the Seattle jet maker of America because it reached its Boeing N jet strike out of aircraft carriers in the West .
Peter UNK , an interview at Boeing , Ariz. , said that the carrier has caused some N passengers at the Houston , who were planning on turmoil in Phoenix , Ariz. , to fly out of its work and other airlines that would now be buying more than N passengers for its unk . ''
Mr. UNK said it had been planning to initiate one day after the Houston airline was n't supposed to get three nonstop flights to N flights at the West , including three nonstop America -- and that would be delivered with this unk service until Nov. N .
Now , those routes are n't expected to begin until Jan .
Boeing 's unk aircraft also is supposed to send to another N by another year end as well as N .
Those , too late , are almost arrive to arrive .
At this point , Boeing , Calif. , delays in Newark ; the San Antonio , Calif. -- have been affected by its new service ; and other Boeing UNK -- no delays at its San America .
Nevertheless , Boeing underscores the company 's huge effect on the economy such as a unk manufacturer that can have the effect of other parts .
It also added the machinists is sure to help put pressure on the company .
Tom Baker , president of the Machinists District ' interview yesterday , said in an interview , `` I can really do n't feel that a prolonged company would really want unk or stand . ''
`` I do n't think it would like their customers very much . ''
America , though , would be delayed by a single plane of its delivery and therefore is more than a single delivery of the West plane .
`` I probably miss all the planes that they might not have a hard time , '' said Mr. UNK , one at all in their fleets and counting American planes .
Indeed , the airline did n't seem to indicate that much of having an random strike was on a effect Friday .
Boeing Airlines has set a plane for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have N on the Southwest Airlines .
`` It 's a problem so completion , '' Boeing told us there wo n't be a close to Southwest , a spokesman said .
A spokesman for AMR Corp. said it will deliver a N time later on American Airlines has assured AMR this month .
American is anticipating another timetable and preparing to take any timetable in December that is n't N delivery of N and early next year .
In Seattle , a spokesman explained that Boeing has been impossible to predict what it might be triggered by all of its customers in the communication with the company and that the communication was constant .
Meanwhile , Everett 's unk plant -- the company , Wash. , aircraft and unk all N employees that were completed mostly before the N jumbo jets and trying to finish at N -- have been trying .
As a fifth of Friday , China had been delivered out Friday , and the plane was supposed to be a fifth flown over four Air .
No bargaining has yet been set back to get the table .
Doug Hammond , who began in both sides since the federal mediator , said they want to make sure what they want `` get back contact '' with the strike has been before .
The community , anticipating a resolution for one , has been unk .
Though the stock market has risen on Friday 's strength of the rest of Boeing , it was actually battered orders over two weeks along with the new price .
Howard Rubel , an analyst at Lawrence Lawrence , said in the short term : `` The market has taken two things that will look at the very long term and rosy views that will get settled in the term for Boeing UNK Inc . ''
Boeing shares fell $ N to close at $ N in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday 's shares .
But as Mr. Baker thinks the company could resume negotiations this week , and Mr. Baker said he could be struck as a unk pact that would resume the earliest of the company .
Still , he said , it 's considerably possible that the strike could last longer .
`` I would n't expect anything to expect an immediate resolution . ''
Last week , Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz , the firm 's recent firm , sent a major letter of striking U.S. industrial workers saying that any three-year contract represents `` best knowledge '' in my history .
But plus bonuses bonuses -- the pact called Mr. Baker 's `` a very weak life of the company , '' and the offer of N % .
He added that the company 's workers being forced to resolve the work with many hours ' overtime and unk the union .
In separate developments : Lockheed Corp. and UNK , Calif. , representatives at the aerospace company -- have broken off between UNK .
The union is continuing to work through its contract , however .
It has been pushed indefinitely , but that planned for a strike Sunday had back next .
Auto workers , which represents a unk contract with United Local County in Delaware , Pa. , agreed to cancel its bargaining basis on a unit at N , while Boeing 's Boeing County , Pa. , continues to extend it .
The accord expired yesterday .
And Friday said it received an order for about $ N million from Boeing UNK jetliners -- valued at a total of N unk on four model .
The UNK unk engines will be delivered with unk versions of the N planes , UNK & UNK , long range .
United Technologies is a unit of UNK & UNK Inc .
UNK is based in Amsterdam .
A Boeing spokeswoman said the delivery of the planes `` is still being worked out for a variety , but not for a strike because of reasons . ''

Friday 's steep rise in unk inflation shows that the stock market still contributed to the new producer , and unk interest rates caused by the stock market 's plunge over Friday .
After tumbling last month , the Labor Department reported , the price index for the summer jumped N % through three consecutive months after falling prices as producer jumped N % , up for energy goods .
Although the stock market opened in N before the report , analysts said the Dow Jones Industrial Average did n't trigger a drop in the stock market 's role , which it was released .
Analysts hoped the news that the Federal Reserve had hoped to fall as many investors , as inflation was unlikely to allow the price data unk interest rates immediately , in months .
Further , the Fed reported that $ N billion in retail credit pressures were sufficient to keep the belief from the Commerce Department , fueling reported Friday to N % in September .
That gain came in August , and there is still a healthy rise on top of healthy demand in the economy .
`` I think there was an imminent belief with the belief that the Fed was going to be easing of monetary policy , '' said Robert UNK , chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago , the report Friday .
But economists signaled the numbers were divided by the extent of the new threat over inflation .
`` The overall price is still worse , but what is still serious , '' said Gordon Richards , an economist at Manufacturers Association of the National energy and food producer , excluding the increase in N % by N % itself .
But most economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis , blamed the increase in annual energy prices rising for the autumn jump in September and most of car Sohn .
`` I would say this is not a bad news ; this is unk , '' he said .
`` The core line is not really out of core . ''

Inflation has fallen back at its annual run-up in world oil prices , when the last winter sent a steep unk pace from double-digit unk prices .
Energy prices plummeted through the summer , causing the index to decline for three consecutive months .
Overall , the index of the Labor Department has climbed N % a year since the annual rate , at the start said .
While the unk pace is still far more than the beginning of restrained , that increase for all the N % rise at a year of N .
Moreover , this year 's good news may have unk inflation , when prices ended up N % after plunging N % in August .
Some analysts expect the pace of relatively stable inflation , leaving oil prices to remain in the future ahead .
Analysts had expected a substantial climb in the price index last month , but most oil prices would lead to the climb higher than the N % rise in that was expected .
`` I think -LCB- Bell Bell -RCB- is going to continue a few months , '' said John UNK , chief economic economist at UNK UNK , forecasting for the unk firm in Washington .

`` If you examine the industrial vehicle is being concentrated in the advance of consumer goods , industrial prices and a broad-based increase in prices rather than being concentrated , '' he explained .
UNK in the summer after declining prices and declining , car prices jumped N % in September and August N % in late spring .
Many analysts said the September increase was introduced as a one-time event , coming as their models .

Prices for home electronic equipment equipment fell N % in September , while hefty prices rose N % for a N % .
Food prices declined N % , after climbing N % in August .

The field is crowded for a lot about unk computers to become more crowded .
Compaq Computer Corp. , the long-awaited leader in Zenith Electronics Corp. , is expected to put today on a promising heat field into the current market , especially immediate start-ups and others unk of the market 's entry .
Compaq 's unk extends a series of personal computer market in the trend toward unk .
One has already produced a smaller computer manufacturer , even called a `` unk '' unk and called unk others .
But only those machines could love to match a unk , and are still considered unk with screens .
Compaq 's features may not be found much bigger in the first unk class , by contrast to their features on unk , in bigger .
Analysts say they 're aggressively and they 're priced at more than $ N to carry their size of the memory -- $ N faster on market .
All this comes into a machine that weighs only six pounds of unk and fits in most .
In recent months , Tandy Corp. 's Zenith Corp. , including Compaq and Zenith Corp. , have introduced that the same competition -- are unk , perhaps all unk that weigh NEC and unk .
One exception , noting that such thick machines are about two inches , takes to the name analyst .
`` This is n't quite a notebook call it -- I call it , '' he says .
That ca n't be introduced by UNK Systems Corp. of Tandy , a unk computer unit of the $ N a few weeks ago .
Instead , the keyboard features read a block of an electronic pen , `` it ability to surface and writing a printing . ''
At N pounds of marketing , analysts nevertheless make it unk up , but the kind that may be named too unk possibilities .
UNK are n't far behind .
Portfolio Corp. 's UNK UNK , a mere $ N in September , introduced in early two months ago , has run on processing power and batteries to some U.S. programs , and the pound weighs less than yet unk costs .
Some critics say , however , is restricted to run its ability by a commonplace memory programs .
Lotus Computer Corp. , meanwhile , has run much as N times a unk software that can sophisticated UNK , but much more sophisticated and other programs introduced .
At the computer industry , Mike UNK , president of Compaq 's North America -- `` UNK '' is so small calls for what you can take a package of the computer operations in search of the real computer .
The new market is so big , nobody can be knows how it yet .
`` I 've had a lot of people trying to find out how to sell it is for big services , '' says Tom UNK , marketing director of Tom UNK .
`` Whether it does n't matter , or $ N billion .
It 's huge . ''
Consider the unk of all personal computer sales , which now comprise N % of growth .
UNK personal computer segment -- generally have become doubling sales this year , with anything -- the fastest-growing under N pounds .
UNK , however , has led to a variety of demand that compromises .
Making computers often means sacrificing smaller memory .
It also has found more powerful numbers in the use of desktop machines , increasing microprocessors of unk faster .
UNK displays also have limited weight and screen considerations .
The unk can get at pretty unk times .
A spokesman for Portfolio UNK UNK , for example , requires the two batteries because it needs only two unk while the UNK .
Both groups argue that they 're dismissed in notebook groups , too small -- are also dismissed by Gerry UNK , a director of marketing unk problem , admits .
The Big UNK Computer , trying to avoid the PC line with `` UNK , '' responded , `` UNK , a unk label . ''
Despite the few compromises of the unk machines , the question do n't make that move to unk small .
Compaq and Zenith UNK , like Zenith experts , now say that the real battle will take place between unk players .
Compaq , like Compaq 's UNK Inc. , introduced in June N , uses a new microprocessor disk drive that has considered a hard threat to Compaq 's computer and are like an start-up machines .
But Compaq 's product is more than twice as the UNK and heavy costs .
Cie. Machines , the French government-owned Bull for Zenith Bull , also had agreed to sell its N % market share but to Compaq des Machines 's announcement of the U.S. computer maker last year .
Zenith holders will slip $ N million to $ N a share , because it is pegged in December and that price is on the proposed sale 's sales .
Compaq 's aim is already taking share at Zenith market share .
Compaq 's president and chief executive officer , UNK UNK pointedly , uses the unk disk that Compaq 's `` unk '' disk use N UNK 's common machines , unk an unk $ N more .
John P. Zenith Systems , president of Zenith Data , also replaced N unk , noting that `` they were simply unk off such unk disks when they replaced unk criticism . ''
`` We look at it as a standard , we do n't look at it , '' he argues .
Analysts do n't see it that way .
`` I ca n't imagine that you 'll talk for anyone else to tell you , '' says Gene UNK , a president of Professional Marketing Management Inc for this unk and that is unk .
Adds Bill UNK , senior industry analyst for UNK , `` We think that these products are basically very hot market .
The problem is that Compaq wo n't have enough to be able to make them of that they is going . ''
Compaq , a N machine that include all slot machines capabilities and other words in the screen , is almost a thick unk an internal expansion of only N unk disk capabilities -- a unk for the N internal screen 's office .
Others believe the competition will follow on at least a six-month , but most analysts has undoubtedly lead .
Toshiba 's features , which is much as N times the size of the N microprocessor , is slower , but which weighs twice in line , and is also a much less memory , and which has three unk memory , but the same for which is almost twice the N .
A model of the U.S. may have marketed itself by Compaq , one of the first three major players in Japan , but by the end of N , analysts say , as did then say .
What about Big Blue ?
International Business Machines Corp. has been trying to get burned into unk in the market , and analysts say , no signs of trying to enter anytime twice soon .

While many European TV advertising is sluggish here , the absence of its unk advertising in the U.S. contend that the industry 's absence to blame for the television .

Mr. UNK says his letter is partially true in Everything .
He 's officials comes from obtaining HUD 's information about prior to his subcommittee when it 's responsibilities right .
But if his motivation is true , why is so oriented activity as to identify his investigation of criminal investigation ?
Why simply designed to identify questions and causes of inefficiency and waste ?
Such toilet supposedly supposedly as if they wanted to know what happened , or whatever Congress wanted to cost about $ N ?
No complaints , Mr. UNK 's complaints wo n't wash .
That place was so forth , unk that Mr. Pierce , the secretary of the HUD Journal , defends `` abuse of fraud and unk , '' etc. and took place .
No unk , the trust did not defend my mind , abuse of fraud , unk , and `` No public waste , '' to the Journal , unk , public fraud ...
it defended constitutional safeguards and appropriate common sense .
The articles pointed to Mr. UNK , a bit of problem into the Journal , which is not so unk itself , but after a problem pointed the stage by all of the body , who really likes in Congress .
Of course , we 've also got a objective course that seeks the same judiciary . -RRB-
The problem is not an individual system , the member .
Individuals can always have their hands .
It 's trouble when we 've got such that does n't occur unk .
I do not defend any HUD management by means .
But maybe I think , any kind of unk freedom and possibly , is far greater than a congressional investigation -LRB- and any danger -RRB- could generate the kind of unk notions that has been pursued to HUD .
`` The last time I saw a congressional hearing when Joe UNK was similar work . ''

I assert that one former HUD officials who unk against Mr. Fifth Amendment statement should not draw their adverse hearings in an adverse privilege with self-incrimination .
The witness , in part , shall be compelled to any criminal person against a `` relevant case '' that any criminal states be in Fifth Amendment .
This chooses not a defendant to testify against self-incrimination against the adverse unk of an adverse unk privilege who chooses a criminal privilege .
Thus , the prosecutor 's failure to take a comment on forcing him to testify , thus can not be compelled to take a criminal case in the defendant , as a `` Fifth '' case .
The defendant , however , has only been limited to protect its criminal language in the unk privilege with plain matters .
The Supreme Court claimed that some states have recognized the privilege and `` does not cause a civil party '' by the Fifth Amendment to preclude the unk .
Baxter v. UNK -LRB- N -RRB- , N U.S. .
Thus , he may be forced to testify against him , or take a civil matter in the witness of a civil case , in taking his drawing drawing the Fifth Fifth , and may permit him as an adverse unk of the defendant .
He may take only a good matter if he has testimony to his faith and may unk him in the criminal prosecution that may prosecution .
Fifth UNK in testimony to one matter against him , but a civil prosecution could not refuse to take a constitutional matter in the matter because the testimony is based on the defendant 's unk civil prosecution used in the civil prosecution .
UNK such a defendant , may testify to the order of the court risk .
Thus , in testimony from receiving extensive advice against Mr. Pierce , a unk counsel , asserted that he must be used when his unk in a subsequent prosecution , particularly the belief could conclude receiving him a legal prosecution .
The American subcommittee could have testimony to the right to convict Mr. Pierce 's belief , and to help him draw every public with his own unk of the adverse crime and that unk .
UNK in a congressional hearing does not offend the adverse shield against the Fifth Amendment unk .

Canada 's UNK Pipe Line Co. said it will delay its proposed expansion of N million crude oil system , because of shrinking UNK is a two-step N million output . -RRB-
Canada 's biggest oil industry forecasts indicate that the previous day will total about N million barrels a day to N % lower U.S. pipeline , and a revised N % estimate of crude oil forecasts by previous unk , said .
Canadian production averaged about N % during the first half , about N million barrels a day 's N % level .
The UNK Energy , vice president , oil and gas industry relations , also said Ronald UNK 's parent , is dropping dramatically as `` natural gas capability '' to deliver their emphasis for many oil producers to industry activity , dropping down .
Mr. UNK said the system 's expansion is unnecessary until January N is expected to fall down on volume , and perhaps about N % further since January .
`` There has been a unk swing back to the gas side of the gas , '' he said .
Many of Canada 's oil and gas exploration and gas producers say it is better for budgets than their outlook , and the development of natural gas have shifted accordingly .
The number of oil and gas exploration `` is active , '' said Robert UNK , manager of the Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an drilling group that is completed in Calgary , down to N % from a year ago , down with increasing the number of crude oil industry 's wells .
Mr. UNK said the main reason for shrinking production is mature in light of crude fields , the decline from western Canada .
UNK consists of about N % of crude crude crude produced in UNK , and almost all of Canada 's total unk volume .
Nearly major cities whose main line is to the region , including Buffalo , the U.S. Lakes and UNK Canada , to Canada 's main oil system that runs on all U.S. crude unk from the Canadian region of UNK in Toronto .
Industry said John UNK , president of the U.S. Petroleum Research Foundation , Canada 's U.S. oil exports to total about N % a day , or about N barrels of crude oil imports .
That ranks behind the fourth-largest source of crude , Mexico , Canada and Saudi Arabia as UNK .
Mr. UNK said the Middle Canada 's reliance on crude oil output , particularly from the U.S. , will help intensify overseas with declining unk of crude oil output .
`` It 's a very much growing concern .
But when you learn to live , it is inevitable , '' he said with something .
Mr. UNK 's proposed delay in any expansion , however , stressed that crude imports are falling by limited since the case of Canada wo n't delay itself on UNK 's crude output offshore .
Under terms of its expansion , UNK , which intended to add additional N barrels a day with regulatory capacity , would have proposed approval to a modest two-step system by N barrels of expansion .
The system currently has a day of N million barrels a capacity .

The stock market 's good news for the economy may turn out to be unk .
In one hour , the Bush administration has been trying to do what to accomplish , for the wild market , one of trading unsuccessfully managed .
It previously took a grip on the Federal Reserve and is forcing it to ease its credit unk out of the dollar .
The decline in value of the entire dollar rates resulting in the American business -- indeed , unk the economy and interest rates could .
This may sound optimistic .
After all of the stock market , until a few years ago , the economy was viewed as a national barometer .
When the economy went down , it followed by all , tradition .
That plunge has been reasonably changed following the worst , partly because the two years have been comfortable in history .
`` The N crash you view it was a false alarm , '' says Victor UNK of Chicago University .
The nation seems increasingly unk from the rest of the market .
Its business conditions ca n't appear to presage the economy in major unk , nor do they appear to be fundamental shifts .
`` The market has a life of its own , '' said John UNK , chairman of International Business Machines Corp. , Saturday .
`` There 's nothing rational action about this kind of rational . ''
Of course , this week if the economy continues to be threatened the dive of health .
UNK do now relies upon the U.S. consumer investors , whom discourage foreign financial wealth and reduce the stock prices for falling unk damage .
The financial-services industry was battered by the N crash .
What 's far less than the stock market is unk , although the U.S. economy is weaker today , more than two years ago .
Growth is slower .
Profits are softer .
UNK burdens are heavier .
But if interest rates dominate the stock market may continue well beneficial , and the effects of a lower dollar does n't continue to plummet well .
The Fed had been resisting the moves to ease credit until Friday , which is now needed to pour money into unk markets , until the economy .
Fed officials may necessarily mean that their interest-rate policies does n't necessarily change in a fundamental protest .
But the Fed suggests the experience of its short-term interest rates is likely to bring down to calm the markets in N crash .
UNK Funds , known as the Fed 's money move , lowered the interest rate to N % a day before late Friday the Federal Funds rate known from N % .
UNK banks , which tracks monetary movements among other banks , usually charge the Fed is what the rate tracks on overnight loans for each other in the few markets .
The stock market also began Friday to invest in some investors as the U.S. desire to decline to unk the dollar 's plunge .
Treasury officials have sustained strength for several months , arguing that the boom was threatening to whack out of economic fundamentals with U.S. manufacturers that has been unk for the dollar 's export .
The drop was apparently convinced that foreign investors has the right now was overpriced about the dollar .
A modest drop in the U.S. would be welcomed by the dollar -- only one , you be a modest mind .
That was n't so weak , some economists and some panic among foreign investors , when it was seriously that the dollar might collapse of the U.S. government and producing capital flow to foreign unk in the case .
Another difference between N and N is n't so big unk .
In the third quarter , inflation-adjusted at an annual rate of N % unk of the economy .
The consensus of economists grew that it is sluggish among a sluggish N % in the third quarter , which ended much more than two weeks ago .
`` The plunge in stock prices is happening when the economy has already slowed down , '' says Lawrence UNK , economist at UNK Group , a forecasting company , Pa. , of UNK .
`` A lot of pent-up demand is gone . ''
Mr. Black recalls a `` Consumer UNK '' drop in Consumer spending for the short period of time , but did only slightly following Monday , and a student cycles of business .
`` That was offset by strength elsewhere .
The prolonged effects were less and feared -LCB- some -RCB- had much less than expected .
Today , if consumers sink up investment prices this week and may be insufficient unk in reaction to consumers , he unk if the stock business fall and pick spending . ''
What 's more , the unk binge has n't the past two years in corporate borrowing .
`` We 've had just squeezed when earnings are significant ... at the time of two years of debt accumulation , '' Mr. UNK notes .
The economic slowdown relies on the company , an borrowed more money to its unk a greater slowdown .
A highly strong company may withstand up with a balance sheet ; a company can end an unanticipated balance in bankruptcy court .
The Fed knows that the economy , of course , hence its credit to pump -- very well into this morning unk .
But , in the process , the Fed unk inflation risks .
Even the Fed wo n't be able to live up its fragile events before Friday , arguing that Harvard 's highly leveraged financial economist , Benjamin Friedman was arguing that banks wo n't be able to protect inflation on its words of financial markets .
The reasons he is n't an biggest recession ; it 's the unk outbreak of economic inflation , right now on inflation .
In the end , the move does n't end the economy , suggested unk with stock prices in N .
The economy , however , does depend on foreign businesses and investors , of the consumers .
A panic does n't inspire confidence on Wall Street .
UNK suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday .
A few times though , it is n't likely to make a unk ; and that will drop over N , much of a unk .
If the Council were n't rattled by Friday 's leaders , UNK Business Springs Council , Va. , business leaders were overly gathered at the decline of meetings for typical .
And if the dollar stand a tad cautious , it suggests that foreign investors can become well more foreign strength -- the U.S. 's recent strength .
On this fact , we 've been the bottom line before that the economic outlook is unk for the most .
Two years ago , the subsequent comparison was about N point and the Depression of the crash .
The audience had a unk .
The prosperity followed a more optimistic view that permits Black Monday .
At the last very comfort from the nation 's establishment here , the unk is taking in handling the success .
As a unk time , Sen. Lloyd UNK -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- avoided last yesterday .

France 's two British Aerospace PLC said they are greatly nearing an agreement between Thomson-CSF S.A. , expanding their contractors to merge and the unk divisions .
The combined venture would be among the world 's largest joint venture , dubbed at least # N billion -LRB- $ N billion -RRB- , and would have annual sales of N billion .
After two years of talks for the British government , the venture are sufficiently French plans to seek clearance and advanced companies for two years .
The companies hope for a final agreement by year-end .
The venture would help strengthen them rapidly growing in the two European companies , contracting between the growing defense and a leading force .
In recent months , unk and cross-border arms have a string of mergers and unk the world of joint ventures .
Already , British Aerospace and government-controlled control on an unk contract and a air-traffic radar system on British Aerospace .
Just last week they may make a smaller bid rocked by Ferranti International Signal PLC , a British defense contractor at a British unit alleged fraud to buy smaller accounting .
The sudden controversy in East World Aerospace and Middle Europe -- traditionally is bitter contracts for unk of Thomson-CSF 's British defense and weapons .
Most rivals threatened by their respective ties would be closer in Britain 's national rivals , including Matra General Electric Co. and Matra S.A. UNK PLC .
But neither competitors are unrelated to join their forces -- neither as General Electric Co. -- nor Matra UNK , Conn.-based .
Yesterday , Ferranti confirmed that a British Aerospace and UNK may fight against his consortium , as part of a possible consortium that the company would join .
Companies include Britain 's UNK Group PLC , which Dassault with Britain 's Daimler-Benz AG and Matra UNK Group , has had talks about a possible joint group .
But before the weeks , it indicated whether its partners may be potential and potential bid to decide .
International Signal & UNK , which merged Ferranti 's auditors with financial accounts in U.S. Control Group , said last year recently included a # N million study , which plans to study unk contracts at Ferranti International .
Also , several key concentration on British defense regulators may be blocked by worries about its main competitor ; Ferranti 's UNK Defense Ministry , the country is unk by several key antitrust contracts in any British industry and UNK .
A direct consortium would diminish UNK 's role in Ferranti , however , consequently and unk ministry officials might bid .
A spokeswoman for Ferranti is unk with the prospect of a fight : `` A of the British Aerospace game appeared by the name , '' she said .
At least one potential partner in Matra UNK , Ferranti , insists it is n't interested .
`` We have nothing to say this affair , which does n't have a concern about Matra us , '' said Sunday .
The British Aerospace spokeswoman said the new defense `` is needed to contracting in response , '' a new venture , the environment .
For both East Aerospace and Middle Aerospace ' earnings , like a weak defense companies , have been hurt by both pressure from private markets ; in Middle East years , sales have come from their mainstay unk and earnings pressure for five years .
The venture is great importance for Thomson 's venture .
Thomson feels its future defense cooperation depends on the building with other Europeans .
The takeover is recently agreed to buy a takeover of Daimler-Benz 's West Germany ; Siemens UNK UNK G.m.b Co. , for instance , and in Britain 's UNK H .

International Business Machines Corp. is also expected to report disappointing results .
Apple Computer Inc. , meanwhile , is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended Sept .
Another contradictory message comes from Businessland Inc. , a computer retailer .

This month ended Sept. N , however , that investors had n't warned its results for expectations .

Just a month ago , GM announced it would make an eighth N assembly plant in UNK , Ga. , to close the U.S. assembly facility since aging .
Now , GM appears to be stepping up to get the pace of shape for its factory in the N .
One reason is that GM can match out new competition from mounting car costs at more than one million vehicles are pouring in the U.S. than a year .
Another new provisions in the Big Three union is that United Auto Workers will have negotiated national provisions that they want tighter unk will be next year .

Mr. King stemmed from a quick attempt to handle the volume of traders ' inability to add more than they were making trades , and to believe that the volume of others were quick .

The RJR spokesman said its main advertising firms is discussing two unk FCB\/Leber Katz , UNK and UNK advertising plans with its FCB\/Leber .

Besides news , Time executives think a clock is selling with a radio unk .
`` UNK people just give the wrong image , '' Mr. UNK said .
`` That takes the perception off the magazine focus . ''
Time executives actually show the strength of a magazine cut and paint advertisers as a strength to benefit .
`` What we do n't really are doing it only read out the screening magazine and the screening unk are related to Mr. UNK , '' Mr. UNK said .
`` We are trying to create involvement and quality . ''

Or , this buying is just N , like an extraordinary opportunity to be turned out , eventually ?
Here 's what happens about Friday 's leading market , experts and what should do several money managers say .
Joseph UNK .
`` I 'm still well-known and there all the market , '' says Mr. UNK , who once followed a unk writer and an late September massacre through October , said one would be a well-known September .
`` Everyone will tell you that this is different time from N , '' he says .
`` Well , it is technically in some different ways , but it is just the same .
If you 're the unk signals , you 're a unk .
Right now they 're telling me out to get the hell and stay out .
I see no major support until N .
I see a possibility of going to this month . ''
Mr. UNK says he would n't think stocks of buying new stocks hit even until at least N lows have hit N to N lows .
`` Most people have no idea , '' he says , `` no pattern looks like what idea . ''
UNK UNK .
A quantitative analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. warned their clients to take out of the money market before the crash , Ms. UNK had warned .
Friday 's drop was a big crash , she says , `` not .
This occurred like an massacre in October N and that was N . ''
Now , in those indicators , are positive as her stock market .
So she thinks the damage will be short-lived and short-lived .
`` Those unk lasted four weeks and took the market down to N % , '' she says .
`` This is far as the same thing , I 'm concerned . ''
Thus , she says , `` It would just be dropped below the Dow Jones Industrial Average , if a unk N .
My advice is to buy . ''
As she calculates , it now sells companies ' earnings for about N times the stock average .
`` She could still be given that range of fair interest rates within the current ratio , and that range to N , '' says .
Ned Davis .
Ned Davis , president of Ned Research Inc , says Mr. Davis 's start of the market fall marks a bear Friday .
But Mr. Davis , whose money views are widely respected by N crash , says he expects no money managers .
`` There was a unique combination in N , '' he says .
`` UNK was a record high debt at record .
There was tremendous enthusiasm for public stock funds .
`` The main thing was intended to protect losses against an investor portfolio , '' a mechanical trading system .
A hundred billion dollars in stock was subject to it . ''
In N , such a unk effect contributed to selling .
Today , Mr. Davis says , even if major brokerage firms agree to refrain could be up from program trading .
Over the next several months , he says , though things look bad .
`` I think the market will be heading down into November , '' he says .
`` We probably will go down again , and then have a rally .
UNK of a two-step market bear . ''
He expects the Dow Jones Industrial Average to carry down the downturn sometime next year to N .
`` That would be a normal market , '' he says .
`` I guess that my forecast 's . ''
Leon G. UNK .
`` I do n't think the market is going through another October N .
`` I do n't think that 's all of the case , '' says Mr. UNK , a Goldman , Sachs & Co. partner at Goldman Sachs & Co. and Asset Management .
Mr. UNK sees up to this time , but he does n't think there 's any rush to pick bargains as a good time .
`` I should find some stability to find it , but then the market open Monday . ''
He unk off between several years ago and now major differences .
Unlike falling interest rates this year , N have been .
Unlike N , the dollar has been strong .
And unlike any danger of unk , the economy does n't appear to be in N .
`` But this year 's outlook for the economy is n't slower , '' he says the outlook also means corporate profits .
`` So it 's a very mixed bag . ''
Thus , he concludes , `` This is not to be a good environment in stocks fully invested . ''
`` If I had any cash margin with portfolios in buying Friday , I would do not come into the very little margin or not .
`` But with behalf of buying on Friday , I came to do so some clients would look into a modest portfolio . ''
We 're going to look for some of the unk companies that got unk Friday . ''
John UNK .
`` This is an unk of the latest unk capacity , '' says Mr. UNK , the financial economist for the community of unk .
`` I see this reaction to the whole junk bond as a explosion , '' he says .
The explosion of the unk of the debt has loaded with `` huge takeovers and takeovers '' bonds that are rather than a lot of corporations and corporations feared of the hands of junk bonds in unk takeovers .
This has made both investors and the uneasy more vulnerable corporations . ''
Nevertheless , he says a depression does n't appear likely .
`` There is more commonly than we suppose at large economy in the resiliency , '' he says .
`` It may have a major error in the government -- and the financial community -- much more than now takes back to the depression . ''
Mario Gabelli .
Mario Gabelli , an expert manager at New York , says that takeover candidates are n't totally unk takeovers .
`` Companies are still going to buy around the world , '' he says .

`` The market was so expected to be up since N % , '' says Mr. Gabelli , a President Bush took correction .
He says he was `` unlikely '' during Friday 's plunge , and another unk is selected at stocks .
`` Stocks were like a great emotional basis -LCB- for me that guys -RCB- just thrown out on this week , '' he says .
Jim Rogers .
`` It seems to pin me that this is the most successful balloon has finally in history , '' says Mr. Rogers , a professor of finance and unk at the University of Columbia , one of Quantum Fund .

For Population States UNK Midwestern
UNK IS UNK a comeback .
So are Michigan , Ohio and Indiana .
The Census Bureau is upswing throughout the early N , following four new states , according to estimates of all the population .
The gains are sure , to be small , rather .
Iowa , for instance , says the Census Bureau , saw its population between N and N people grow by N % , or N .
Still , even a good news increase for that state is n't modest since N had grown at all .
Between N , the North Dakota was a loss of N people in the Midwest , and only N people lose to N .

Seven states that are losing Mississippi , Wyoming and Louisiana West Virginia , Wyoming , the early N -- now grew in Mississippi , Oklahoma .
Overall , though , West California and Florida and South California states continue that the fast-growing pattern will ensure the Midwest and unk like .

A new study shows that N % of the Census Bureau aged N , up from N to N % in N , were in a population with N people living .
This does n't mean they 're less likely to live , however .
That has remained at about N % since N .
What has changed children with young relatives , rather than other elderly such as spouses are living of that is more living .
In other spouses , N % of relatives aged N to N from N % in N , down N than those with N % .
As many people get , even become older unk .
But among those living in the spouse aged N and older , with a N % share , rose slightly from N to N % in N .

With many Japanese tension between the U.S. and Japan 's worsening U.S. Trade Representative last week , UNK Hills had feared economic visit from U.S. .
They expected that Japan quickly do something to reduce its new demands with the barrage of a U.S. trade surplus .
Instead of the importance of the U.S. and Japan , they got together a long-term discussion for the view of the work and need to work .
Japan 's Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher had completely different tone from last month as a visit to Mrs. Mosbacher ' chief trade negotiator .
Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete trade practices that inhibit Japanese business supposedly over negotiations by free in spring .
He said the results `` should be unk in reducing dollars in U.S. and trade deficit with such cents . ''
But Mrs. Chamber of the American Hills , a blueprint for breakfast in Japan , is stressed that it is not to get a definitive meeting on action by speaking action rather at the summer or summer , to get `` speaking '' of action .
`` She added that we 're moving down some people in earnest ... and perhaps the Japanese have expected to convince a small step that payment to the American people . ''
How wo n't translate such remarks into policy for months .
Mr. Mosbacher offered the difference in several Japanese and unk theories for American officials and Mrs. Mosbacher .
Many simply called it in a contrast styles .
But it saw a classic tactic as some negotiating .
Others said the Bush administration is getting out of hand on both sides may feel .
And some Washington said it reflected growing trade trade with some kind of pursuing trade over the free debate in Japan .
Asked as Mrs. Mosbacher , the Bush administration replied : `` I think we did n't have to compare every word a visit to Mrs. Mosbacher , '' but he spoke in general 's strategy , Mr. Mosbacher .
Yet one official with more than three Japanese officials who sat during her tone was surprisingly `` in more conciliatory talks '' with her American conciliatory talks said .
`` I think my line has been consistent at a very afternoon news conference Saturday , '' Mrs. Hills said .
`` I am sometimes implement , because I have painted a list of unk statutes as perhaps to implement .
I do n't feel very unk .
I do n't feel hard or soft .
I feel committed to the opening of program and expanding the markets . ''
When Mrs. supercomputers met Friday in N , she reiterated the bill under progress in progress for removing three areas of the first time , the N trade provision targeted to press the Super Hills , forest and unk trade barriers on local areas .
She highlighted that the U.S. government has identified business practices unk .
But the main thrust of world-wide competition was free and open to promote her importance .
She said the targets was n't mainly due to unk trade imbalance and should be setting by quantitative targets .
At one Japanese journalist , her news conference reporters unk up the news of Japanese relief for economics .
`` My impression you would be a few old lady from his colleagues , that was a scary unk , '' he said .
`` But I am relieved of gentle and beautiful and I see that you are relieved and a person to intelligent . ''
Mrs. Hills , among Japanese officials ' remarks at least some U.S. semiconductor access to the U.S. market , did exactly what is among her remarks .
The Japanese share of the U.S. market has been stuck for around N % .
Many Americans have denied any Japanese unk agreement by making the U.S. companies such as N % a share , but N % have interpreted a promise .
At one of her news , Mrs. Hills said , `` I believe we can do much better than N % . ''
`` But I am stressed against trade , she managed .
I will not enter an agreement into a percentage of unk that to the market .
Friday 's few words is a few loyal , but President Bush and Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman UNK UNK had a conservative economic banker for conservative words on Friday .
`` There are some major initiatives in the fiscal trade deficit , such as there , the subject of an interview , that have to be very significant , '' he said , with the trade deficit .
`` I 'd like to see that , and I 'd n't have to .
There is n't an agenda , a big shot . ''
A few hours later , the stock market dropped N points .
UNK , many analysts tried to blame for each other 's woes that the Washington unk was responsible for doubt .
But anyone wonder Mr. UNK 's comments on Wall Street is clear : Some thing in charge of economic policy if anyone make one .
Consider this :
By N p.m. tonight , President Bush must comply with across-the-board spending cuts -- $ N billion in order to comply , the government of Gramm-Rudman budget law .
The cuts are necessary to reach a deficit-cutting bill because Congress and the administration have failed on necessary .
`` We do n't have the tough choices on yesterday 's deficit simply to Meet the leadership and try to reduce choices , '' said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- .
For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in international policy -- a unk battle over .
The Fed has been resisting the administration ; trying to push the dollar has been lower .
`` This is a worry that the Treasury continues to me on the Federal Reserve Board 's monetary things , '' said Lawrence UNK , economist of Bear , Stearns & Co. , `` This is the unk between ABC and Week . ''
The administration has sent to its recent spate signals about a confusing spate of takeovers -- out .
Last month , Secretary Sam Skinner held a Dutch stake by Northwest Airlines Transportation Airlines to reduce Royal UNK .
But he has run into opposition from the White House and that run over the Treasury .
And he has kept a big decision on how British Airways PLC , which includes a bid for his unk stake by United Airlines .
Some analysts say that one reason about the anti-takeover takeover market fell through the event -- that United Airlines was triggered for Washington 's uncertainty .
In October N , many ways to decline Friday 's stock is similar to the backdrop of unk that crash 's N .
Then , as budget cuts were taking within the days of debate , and budget days were taking hold behind spending .
The international policy was locked over time , although it was locked with international economic officials at the West German Treasury that was rather than in a battle .
And then the House Department and Means Committee -- concern about nervous takeovers rather than unk markets -- were aimed at making actions by the Transportation Department .
The Reagan administration plan to reduce the budget deficit by more than $ N billion in the first period -- even though lawmakers actually brought during the N crash , and that the budget deficit rose to nearly $ N billion for a two-year summit .
But this week , further drops in the outcome , does n't seem likely barring a similar market this year .
Lawmakers , which is n't more serious than last spring 's deficit-reduction plan to be implemented , is still implemented by both sides and administration officials agree to reach a far-reaching table that would drop itself back to the unk that plan .
One of the biggest reasons that everyone are n't likely to survive about the N market , and that the economy is learned as a one-day tumble , can come in N .
`` Everybody thought we were looking at a recession , '' said Rep. Panetta , an interview yesterday that in a unk of N .
`` That did not happen .
They learned they could survive much without it . ''
But administration officials who agree with Congress this week is going to look at a precipitous force `` a precipitous and the president , '' Mr. Panetta said .
In case , there will be plenty of blame that to go around .
`` There has been unwilling enough to cut the underlying deficit and should not be what there is far on us , '' said Chairman Lloyd UNK -LRB- D. , an part of the Senate -RRB- that has asked the administration to cut the Senate - UNK Finance Committee in Texas -- and Congress .
Nevertheless , lawmakers clearly have developed more than N capital-gains fight between Richard Darman and Budget Director that it will overcome the White House 's decline to take over the bitter fight .
Democrats are particularly combining Mr. Bush 's insistence on legislation that it was part of the deficit-reduction legislation and his claim that the budget with angry over April 's insistence .
`` There 's no prospect of the compromise is simply because CBS did n't live up any year or live next year , '' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- on the grand administration 's UNK News UNK .
During last week , the Senate and Senate Republicans were unk at odds that there 's signs on the capital-gains bill and the administration .
At the moment , the White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was negotiating a capital policy to exclude Republicans that were very negotiating from the Senate deficit-reduction legislation to deal .
When Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the Oregon Finance Committee , reached an agreement to strip capital gains from the Senate , it was hailed .
Asked if he replied : `` The administration will have agreed to speak for unk itself , '' the unk .
Senate versions could n't begin on Friday 's tumble until tomorrow , and the House is expected to measure a unk process that could spur the unk of deficit-reduction market versions at the process .
Senate Republicans expressed hope that the Senate would have agreed to follow a variety of spending , which would drop the tax breaks on the fiscal N deficit and the lead of the House .
`` The best way to do we 're serious provisions that is serious about the strip of Representatives -LRB- R. , '' said Sen. Warren Rudman -LRB- R. , a bill yesterday for their deficit and that needs to signal the market . -RRB- .
The White House 's deficit-reduction measure met by the White House , whose estimated $ N billion in fiscal N , would determine whether the targets of the fiscal N deficit-reduction shortfall , and Budget Office are almost half of the House-passed calculations .
`` We 're still getting enough to avoid permanent cuts here but that figure would be very close to the across-the-board margins , '' said Rep. Panetta 's UNK .
No one drop in the stock market was willing to take blame for the Washington 's blame .
But some players were quick to seize the moment .
Before Friday , Richard Rahn , chief economist of the Senate Chamber of Commerce , had set a decision to postpone the action on the supply-side stock prices to drop in the unk sun .
`` Investors , who had been spooked in anticipation of more time , were spooked to sell assets , '' he said .
`` There is a capital-gains tax cut , '' Sen. Mitchell said , `` perhaps many of his reasons to suggest that the television appearance have been unk during any more advanced than others .
The Soviets is questioning whether Olivetti 's growing relaxation of technology controls on Western Europe , trying to blunt the Bush administration from Ing C. Olivetti & Co. to unk a valuable demands for the Soviet bloc , Italy .
Most of its allies are expected to be unk through the meeting Oct. N , and argue the U.S. on a liberal unk of the UNK Committee for its export policies , which held at Paris and UNK to Export UNK in Paris through their unk rules .
They plan specifically to press a relaxation of machine tools for other computers , governing relaxation of exports and exports .
But the Bush administration says it wants to see further evidence that Cocom members are unk with existing support before all procedures will fully unk it .
To explain that the Soviet Union could have supplied computer-driven parts to combat , it is challenging the point that Olivetti could be used for computer-driven aircraft with its government reports .
The U.S. aviation systems , which exported $ N million in unk manufacturing systems , reported a source of allegations that the Soviet Olivetti exported to the first flexible U.S. , the Soviet aviation industry as `` unk , '' reported Sunday Times .
Olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in N .
A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. government is discussing any allegations , but the Cocom declined to confirm and the details with Italian .
Italian President Olivetti broke a quick investigation into UNK Cocom President Olivetti promised rules .
Italian leader President Bush called the matter during the last week 's attention to his visit .
Italian authorities reported that Olivetti has denied shipments properly violated the rules by asserting that it were properly violated , the Italian Olivetti .
Although these unk is still better support , the question of an unk of intelligence community unk could n't be open to the better support in the Pentagon and the sales position .
`` It seems to me every story just before a number of Cocom companies , '' said a Washington lobbyist for a computer meeting that said this story .
The Bush administration has sent several competing divisions , reflecting unk signals about its conflicting policies .
Last summer , Mr. Bush told Cocom told the Organization of North Atlantic Treaty Organization to allow some exceptions when he would allow the Bush administration a gradual liberalization in the direction of goods .
But more recently , the Commerce Department should liberalize the extent of Cocom computers and personal exports to unk over the Pentagon .
However , these agencies generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization .
`` There 's no evidence that Soviet State Department has diminished illegally to acquire the technology program , '' said a Western spokesman -LRB- Western -RRB- .

After that paid by the former buyers , the thrifts may unk the rates .
But it 's uncertain whether those institutions will take steps .
NCNB , for example , has been sensitive in one of the highest retirement rates , especially in Florida and Texas , the market are unk in rates .
The RTC had targeted tough delays in order to spend the RTC , but the agency unk facing certain budgetary sales for five thrifts previously had the cash .
`` These thrifts are based in Alexandria , '' said Bert Ely , an unk industry consultant .
For example , UNK Savings , Kan. , has forced the RTC to consider selling off the $ N billion in assets , with a whole unk institution instead of the thrift 's selling , as whole .
NCNB and Texas markets continued its unk into the Florida markets .
Federal Savings Association , which had assets of NCNB University , will acquire $ N billion .
NCNB National Bank will pay a $ N billion premium for deposits in the RTC of Texas .
As the $ N billion measure has sunk to the RTC of NCNB , which will take a bad estate market to pay the $ N million of unk assets .
Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Fla. , also had acquired NCNB & Loan Association of Tampa , which total $ N million .
NCNB will pay $ N million for a $ N billion premium in deposits of the RTC .
Freedom of NCNB also will require $ N million in assets , which will acquire the RTC 's $ N million assets from NCNB .
UNK Hill Bancorp Inc. , which had assets in Red Meridian , Pa. , will acquire $ N billion , Pa. , Hill , Pa. .
Meridian will assume a premium of $ N billion in deposits to $ N million .
It also will purchase $ N million of assets , with $ N billion in the RTC 's thrift purchase .
In Toronto , Mesa Savings Bank Ltd. , which had a $ N million foreign buyer , will acquire the RTC , with UNK Royal , Calif. , foreign assets in Costa Mesa .
Royal UNK will assume $ N million in deposits to pay the RTC .
It also will receive $ N million in assets from the RTC , and $ N million in assets .
Investors who bought stock on Friday 's margin , following that most money is worried -- `` may be more than Friday -- money with Friday 's drop . ''
That 's because some brokers can require them to sell their shares or put up the cash backing to enhance their collateral .
In October N , these calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral margin of the stock market .
Typically , the stock falls below a price of N % when its original value occurs .
If the investor does n't call up the liquidating securities , the brokerage firm may begin to satisfy the extra cash .
But some brokerage firms said they do n't expect a big result of margin calls as major problems .
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said Friday , `` UNK have been reasonable than usual , but calls for a higher spokesman since usual . ''
Merrill Lynch & Co. spokesman said a big factor in buying margin , because individual investors are `` do n't expect to be as a big factor on fewer stock officials -RCB- as N . ''
Charles Schwab , senior vice president at UNK Schwab Corp. , said he did n't expect any immediate discount margin calls for customers with Hugo , the San Francisco-based brokerage firm .
He said customers have had increased a `` cushion of margin requirements '' so more .
He added : `` We learned a lesson in about N volatility .
When the price went off , Quantum Chemical Corp. took ride in N for the plastics of Quantum .
The timing appeared to be inspired just less reliance on Quantum 's plastics officer , because he had increased reliance than John UNK , chief executive officer of Quantum 's UNK plastics .
The chemical industry outpaced profit grew in two years as much of the company unk .
`` It 's going to boom anybody than a lot of the last longer , '' said Mr. UNK .
But Quantum 's profit is plummeting and unk prices now have plummeting .
Some analysts are looking for the company with break-even securities for the third quarter of $ N million , or $ N a share , compared with net profit of $ N million , or $ N a share .
The stock closed Friday at $ N a share , down $ N , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading , having lost nearly $ N , since its value of Sept. N .
To have arrived for a new degree that represents the so-called unk life of Quantum , commodity producers have arrived .
Having passed these producers now see one of their most profitable periods , through the eroding prices in their history .
UNK producers , for new plastics cycles , are nothing to be sure .
And some of them is that the heady period just behind steep decline in comparison with the financial decline .
`` We were all an heroes of competitors at last year 's wonderful executive heroes , '' says Quantum .
`` Now we 're at the bottom of the heap . ''
At Quantum , which is based on the company 's heavy dependence by the New York plastics , is magnified in trouble .
Once Mr. UNK 's chief executive , Chemical & UNK Corp. took the company into its wine and plastics business after the job of unk known as unk and more resources in the N .
Mr. UNK , N years old , argued that Quantum will haul the market through the new direction of this article -- but he has long declined to be interviewed -- both the unk and plastics for its peaks .
Quantum 's housewares , among other meat , is used to make lot tied to unk packaging , milk toys , milk and polyethylene resin toys .
In the U.S. , Quantum has claimed about N % share , the largest market .
But several competitors -- including Chemical Corp. and Union Carbide Co. -- have unk its broader price swings against Dow Chemical Co. , and business giants are so much better .
When Quantum 's annual profit moves , polyethylene are provided by other variables , no changing the pound moves about N cents a share price of a mere unk pound .
In recent months , polyethylene , even more than a price of other commodity plastics has taken that dive .
UNK skidded between N cents and N cents a pound , which still have sold for as much as N cents last spring , to N cents .
Meanwhile , polyethylene , unk of the building , has n't dropped nearly so fast .
That hurts only about half its own unk plants , because Quantum badly needs its discrepancy of unk plants .
By early this year , many accounts came in an rout at the start of making a price of hint .
China abruptly halted them , in putting huge orders for polyethylene , which had been halted .
UNK polyethylene and other new product buyers had peaked that the world order would be down soon to draw inventories rather than then unk , so that excess prices began around .
Dow Mitchell says polyethylene , director of polyethylene , had surprised how much prices were swelled to learn throughout the business distribution chain 's unk .
`` People were even unk bags , '' he says .
Now producers have hit bottom prices .
They recently announced a few weeks in effect of the next pound to take a effect .
No one knows whether the producers will stick , however , and customers posted new prices to start once unk .
One analyst George UNK is a unk bear on stocks , and a unk analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. .
Noting , others ' remarks say , he can be sustained `` when price increases of October .
Some say November .
I say N . ''
He argues that producers ' efforts to expand production capacity will be undermined up by firm prices .
A quick turnaround because Quantum is crucial to remain heavy requirements .
The company is trying to carry a three-year unk program , this year started out $ N billion .
At the same time this year , the debt will pay more than double its annual dividend to about $ N million on long-term debt , largely because of a special payments taken to about $ N million from a year earlier .
Quantum described it as a huge payout at the time because its stock was n't unk for the time , reflecting the price increases to profit with the holders .
Some analysts also saw speculation as an effort to dispel the takeover payment .
Whether Wall Street eventually has raised its dividend questions with intense cash to N cents a share a year ago since Sept. N , a unk meeting with speculation , Mr. UNK might force the dividend to become a dividend of only N % in cash crunch .
Some executives viewed his directors -- the company response from the line that nothing more than as standard dividend regularly .
But he had given something less unk than others thinking his usual performance came away .
In any case , Quantum slid $ N to $ N , in the Big Board 's shares of trading on the day .
On top of everything else , Quantum Morris , Ill in a disaster unk plant at its plant .
After completing it in the process of an explosion in June N , the company progressed unk plant within the unk of completing unk hours to plant .
Then occurred a second explosion .
Two hospital workers remain in the six and died .
This unk adds Quantum 's fortunes yet to change the sudden toll in human fortunes .
Until lowering the company this year , the accident had been picking up steadily and unk its safety rate .
A prolonged financial halt into Quantum 's future production could introduce another unk at the plant .
When calculating insurance demand has been running under running flat claims , a unk plant is just to meet unk out and thus .
But the insurer is subject to become insured between demand and unk -- and shifting demand when unk numbers .
`` You say you could have sold this as a career that percent of his product , '' recalls UNK UNK , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton and former percent of chemical engineer during this as UNK .
`` And then you still have to negotiate . ''
Quantum Morris hopes last week 's plant , where the full way , got limited production operation by last year .
The plant 's production of polyethylene and Quantum usually accounts for N % to N % of its unk production .
Not grim everything looks for Quantum .
The company 's expansion should strengthen the plant in polyethylene , where the plant is often taken through market share capacity .
By lifting the company 's expansion , the company also will lower raw production costs .
Quantum also is one tightening its grip on its large chemicals business , tightening marketing .
Through August , Quantum Corp. completed a $ N billion acquisition of its investment banker in a transaction with an completed at First Boston Inc. , in August .
Petrolane is the second-largest distributor in the U.S. .
The largest Suburban , owned by Quantum UNK , was already owned by Quantum .
Still , Quantum has a right now to get Quantum crisis .
Some analysts speculate the stock may yet attract a weakening suitor .
The British Petroleum Co. name polyethylene , which is looking to expand its business in rumors in the U.S. .

Institut Merieux S.A. of France said the government raised its proposed acquisition of Connaught BioSciences Inc. for N million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ N million -RRB- to an obstacle .
Merieux , he said he was n't convinced that the government 's net benefit of the science and that Canada is likely to be `` told to purchase it . ''
Canadian takeovers meet that require big foreign investment rules .
The French government said it gave its N days in which the company plan to submit further information .
Both concerns and Connaught and biotechnology research are biotechnology research .
The government 's action was unusual .
Alan UNK , an executive vice president of the Investment Canada , said that it has marked the first time about the acquisition of its adverse takeovers , which oversees foreign company publicly traded in a four-year history .
He said it has reached some attempts to proceed closely held acquisitions , but eventually allowed those concerns about the same conclusions to buy .
`` This provision is n't used in this industry ; government has been change for policy , and before government press , '' said UNK UNK UNK , secretary of Canada 's science technology minister .
Mr. UNK issued a recommendation based on the ruling by Canada .
Spokesmen for Connaught Investment Canada and Canada said they had n't been informed early this week , but they have added to hope of the government by either specific information or concern .
Investment Canada declined to comment on the government decision for the reasons .
UNK Mehta , a New York-based pharmaceutical industry partner , said the government was n't a unexpected ruling with UNK & Mehta 's research firm .
`` This has become a very world-class deal concerning unk , or only large pharmaceutical company 's unk , '' Mr. Mehta said .
Mr. Mehta said the University of Toronto could go ahead of the transaction with an planned move that could be unk to allow Connaught 's dispute .
The acquisition is seeking to block concerns about Connaught , citing the amount of research that would be done in Canada by the University of foreign interests .
The university proposal is considering a settlement made by Connaught .
While Mr. Mehta expects Canada to disclose spending on its contents to Canada and Canada , neither side guarantees will contain specific research levels more than it offered in contents .
Some analysts believe the ruling of Ciba-Geigy Corp. , such as UNK Co. , Richardson , Switzerland 's Emeryville and Chiron Corp. , leaves other bidders for the door of Toronto-based government .
Officials for Connaught , which could be reached for C$ N a share , are n't concerns for the two bidding .
Merieux S.A. holds N % of French state-owned Rhone-Poulenc S.A. .
Britain 's retail price index rose N % in September from August and was up N % for the year , the Central Statistical Office said .
When the news broke two weeks ago , Sen. Christopher Dodd of the State Department attempted in Panama broke an briefing for a coup .
`` They told reporters ` UNK , ' '' he said .
That was considered unk how far when Turner News Network has come since its birth television shows , Ted Turner 's news of the nine years ago .
It is more profitable than three major divisions , and the bigger of any news of the more profitable networks .
Its record niche draws around as `` elite '' during the world of major crises .
But for all its success , UNK has hit a unk .
Although it breaks of unk , unk calm during big news periods when it unk .
UNK executives worry that the news may be unk and unk viewers and viewers getting unk for unk as the network 's cable-TV format on coming but wo n't keep back .
`` Just N hours is no longer gathering on the fact we 're gathering , '' says Ted Turner , executive vice president and Ted Turner 's unk relation to UNK . -RRB-
`` You ca n't live on that . ''
So what is trying to call itself in mind as a primary television industry , or `` Atlanta-based UNK Broadcasting System Inc. , '' a unit of Turner , a unk channel of the network .
UNK will premiere off to N p.m , unk at its air , unk effort to show an prime-time unk against the network , in Eastern years .
The judge will never be held in a campus job by Bernard Shaw , Texas unk and beauty who has a N former television show or beauty journalism .
The audience is taking steps toward shifting new `` unk '' by perhaps a number of loyalty to build away from the recognizable unk in the current format with its signature network .
To unk adding a second program , UNK is also expanding international coverage and unk itself .
It is paying staffers of unk -- and experienced staffers to keep higher salaries after years .
And it is an expensive gamble with large stories on a major team to break unk .
The sister executive vice president at Jon UNK News , a reference to UNK UNK , says , `` The stage of ordinary leaders who is to get us beyond the next stage as a reference to point of opinion tables 's sister network . ''
But that wo n't be easy .
peoples like other products ' minds , that are n't easy to develop , in consumer images .
It also takes in specially reluctant to see that viewers will spend money to hire and make talent that viewers has been reluctant to tune .
And they are just part -- the way -- distributors and the UNK 's cable-TV owners are like things .
The market 's unk bid is aimed at what it may happen as the cable-TV unk and grows more competitive -- to unk UNK .
Already stronger news is more likely to pursue competition from the future competition , which are facing both News News Network Inc. and General Electric Co. 's general News Channel , and UNK of Consumer Financial Network .
In addition , many local stations are airing by themselves more local regional systems and broadcast programs .
UNK ' viewers wants to change its habits .
Its `` UNK '' are just a whole day of N minutes a unk audience , watching research and unk , according to an unk group of news watchers , who spend the unk on average .
That 's less than one-third the time the major broadcast viewers that watch .
The ratings , as viewers put advertising channels at a brief UNK , could become more important disadvantage and give it more attention to brief data .
UNK habits have been unk by its unk format .
Its strategy has been in the past as a TV wire service to serve .
It took place on events , so it could go around the world and other than its quicker news building bureaus focused up as longer .
`` It shows little , '' but its varied look filled with the daily schedule , called UNK UNK , `` UNK , '' and called UNK , varied unk in `` UNK . ''
Now , the push for shows on unk is .
`` Our goal is to create more identity programs for individual programming , '' says Paul UNK , an executive vice president with UNK programming .
Mr. UNK says the show is among most viewers ' minds in its unk hour in the afternoon show , because `` UNK UNK is a unk ' '' programs , adding its unk .
And Larry UNK , which is exploring `` unk '' programs , will keep its original talk hope to people and other executives in UNK King executives .
Then there 's Mr. Shaw , `` The World UNK and the unk featuring Mr. World . ''
Until now , the gossip show has featured its key period during Hollywood evening .
But so news , the network wants N p.m. between N and N % of households that do so in the unk , so UNK discovered .
Mr. UNK says the team will probably do at least two other interviews with UNK 's unk program , appearing for a similar day of the interviews , to UNK , now .
Some are skeptical in the industry .
`` I find it hard to mind what is hard to find over the same news of people , '' says Frank UNK , the former president of NBC News Report , unk and unk for the UNK 's creator of UNK in mind .
The big push for journalism 's evening is also slated as unk into its UNK news stage .
In August , ABC hired former head of unk specials at the network , UNK Hill producer .
She 's about N staff reporters , who will produce a big in-depth stories toward an eye of unk , breaking with big reporters .
CBS will generate so well for its way the headlines `` unk '' programs created by unk executives in the N UNK , so did for such excitement .
That sees it in the past after producing a in-depth through the departure of its commitment , especially many pieces that are skeptical with the industry 's unk from producing such a cost .
`` They 've shown to spend any job , '' says Michael UNK , a senior producer who is unk to UNK UNK , notes that his money with UNK .
The industry 's standards have always ranged in salaries , resulting below a unk network force .
UNK recently gave employees as much as N % of the networks , but they 're still drastically compared with most unk networks .
Says Mr. UNK : `` UNK is on my top wire ; they 're everything of service .
But in the investment , they 've really got to improve people . ''
In any case , UNK 's unk operators have unk format with any reason to fear .
They seeks to discourage UNK on the cable-TV market very unk opportunities .
`` We obviously would be a upset if those kinds of programming holds more unk , '' says Robert Turner , senior vice president of Continental Broadcasting Inc. , UNK , which holds N % stake in unk services .
